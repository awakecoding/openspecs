# 1 Introduction

The SSDP: Networked Home Entertainment Devices (NHED) Extensions are a set of extensions to the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP), as specified in [[UPNPARCH1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90554), and are used to detect devices on a home network. In this specification, the SSDP: Networked Home Entertainment Devices (NHED) Extensions are referred to as SSDPE.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_uniform-resource-identifier-uri"></a>
**Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**: A string that identifies a resource. The URI is an addressing mechanism defined in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax [[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453).

<a id="gt_universal-plug-and-play-upnp"></a>
**Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)**: A set of computer network protocols, published by the UPnP Forum [[UPnP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90553), that allow devices to connect seamlessly and that simplify the implementation of networks in home (data sharing, communications, and entertainment) and corporate environments. UPnP achieves this by defining and publishing UPnP device control protocols built upon open, Internet-based communication standards.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.2"></a>
## 1.2 References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the [Errata](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn781092.aspx).

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

SSDP (as specified in [[UPNPARCH1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90554)) is used to detect [**Universal Plug and Play**](#gt_universal-plug-and-play-upnp) (as specified in [[UPnP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90553)) devices on a network. SSDP is maintained by the UPnP Forum and is published by the UPnP Implementers Corporation.

The SSDP: Networked Home Entertainment Devices (NHED) Extensions, also known as SSDPE, provide a mechanism for a control point to discover a device on the network without requiring the device to implement a complete SSDP stack. SSDP is simplified by removing the requirement for a description document (substituted with device-specific information in an Alternate Location (AL) header in each announcement) and by removing the need for a multicast listener (substituted with frequent periodic announcements).

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The SSDP: Networked Home Entertainment Devices (NHED) Extensions depend on protocols described in section 1.1 of [[UPNPARCH1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90554), specifically:

- HTTP (Multicast over UDP) (HTTPMU)
- Universal Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- Internet Protocol (IP)
<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The SSDP: Networked Home Entertainment Devices (NHED) Extensions have no additional prerequisites/preconditions beyond what is required for SSDP, as specified in [[UPNPARCH1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90554).

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The SSDP: Networked Home Entertainment Devices (NHED) Extensions provide a mechanism for a control point to discover a device on the network without requiring the device to implement a complete SSDP stack.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

The SSDP: Networked Home Entertainment Devices (NHED) Extensions do not specify anything beyond what is specified by [[UPNPARCH1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90554).

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

The AL header (as specified in [[SSDP1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94665)) in the ssdp:alive message contains a bracketed list of [**URIs**](#gt_uniform-resource-identifier-uri) (as specified in [[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453)). The vendor can extend that list with any URIs that comply with the rules specified in [RFC3986].

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

There are no standards assignments other than what is specified in [[UPNPARCH1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90554).

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The SSDP: Networked Home Entertainment Devices (NHED) Extensions do not specify anything beyond what is specified by [[UPNPARCH1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90554).

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

The SSDP: Networked Home Entertainment Devices (NHED) Extensions MUST follow the Simple Service Discovery Protocol discovery advertisement messages syntax, as specified in [[UPNPARCH1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90554) section 1.1, with the following exceptions:

- The LOCATION header MUST contain the single character "*".
- The AL header (as specified by [[SSDP1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94665)) is required and MUST contain a list of [**URIs**](#gt_uniform-resource-identifier-uri) ([[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453)), with each URI framed by the characters "<" and ">".
The SSDP: Networked Home Entertainment Devices (NHED) Extensions SHOULD NOT implement the Simple Service Discovery Protocol discovery search messages syntax as specified in [UPNPARCH1] section 1.2.

<a id="Section_3"></a>
# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Device Details

SSDP (as specified in [[UPNPARCH1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90554)) is used for device discovery between control points and devices. On the device, specific messages are multicast.

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>

<a id="Section_4"></a>
# 4 Protocol Examples

A new device is set up and plugged in to the home network for the first time. When it is turned on, the device first sends over port 1900 a UDP multicast message of ssdp:byebye, and then, immediately afterward, a message of ssdp:alive. The ssdp:byebye message is sent just before the ssdp:alive message to ensure cancellation of any previously sent ssdp:alive message.

The following examples could be used for a particular Microsoft Xbox 360 device.

NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1

HOST:239.255.255.250:1900

NT:urn:schemas-microsoft-com:nhed:presence:1

NTS:ssdp:byebye

LOCATION:*

USN:uuid:00000000-0000-0000-0200-00125A8A0960::urn:schemas-microsoft-

com:nhed:presence:1

NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1

HOST:239.255.255.250:1900

NT:urn:schemas-microsoft-com:nhed:presence:1

NTS:ssdp:alive

LOCATION:*

CACHE-CONTROL:max-age=4

AL:<urn:schemas-microsoft-com:nhed:attributes?type=X02&firmwarever=

5766.0&udn=uuid:10000000-0000-0000-0200-00125A8A0960>

USN:uuid:00000000-0000-0000-0200-00125A8A0960::urn:schemas-microsoft-

com:nhed:presence:1

SERVER:dashboard/1.0 UpnP/1.0 xbox/2.0

**Note** In these examples, the NT, USN, and AL header values are placeholders to be replaced by application-specific values.

The device continues to resend these messages every 5 seconds until a control point that is listening on the network for this ssdp:alive message responds with the appropriate behavior. The contract between the control point and the device for the expected control point response behavior is outside the scope of this protocol. However, as an example, a device could listen on an agreed-upon TCP port, and when the control point connects to this TCP port (in response to having received a device ssdp:alive message) the device could assume it has been discovered and cease sending the SSDP messages.
