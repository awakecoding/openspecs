# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the syntax and interpretation of [**certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template). While not strictly a protocol, the templates form the basis of [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) management for the Windows Client Certificate Enrollment Protocol. This specification consists of [**attributes**](#gt_attribute) that are accessed by using [**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap), as specified in [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325). These attributes allow clients to define the behavior of a [**certificate authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) when processing certificate requests.

Familiarity with the Windows Client Certificate Enrollment Protocol Specification is required for a complete understanding of this specification.

Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_access-control-entry-ace"></a>
**access control entry (ACE)**: An entry in an [**access control list (ACL)**](#gt_access-control-list-acl) that contains a set of user rights and a [**security identifier (SID)**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) that identifies a principal for whom the rights are allowed, denied, or audited.

<a id="gt_access-control-list-acl"></a>
**access control list (ACL)**: A list of [**access control entries (ACEs)**](#gt_access-control-entry-ace) that collectively describe the security rules for authorizing access to some resource; for example, an object or set of objects.

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) as its primary access protocol. Active Directory stores information about a variety of [**objects**](#gt_object) in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md). Active Directory is either deployed as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), which are both described in [MS-ADOD](../MS-ADOD/MS-ADOD.md): Active Directory Protocols Overview.

<a id="gt_asymmetric-algorithm"></a>
**asymmetric algorithm**: A synonym for public key algorithm. For an introduction to these concepts and related terminology, see [[RSAFAQ]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90503).

<a id="gt_attestation"></a>
**attestation**: A process of establishing some property of a computer platform or of a trusted platform module (TPM) key, in part through TPM cryptographic operations.

<a id="gt_attribute"></a>
**attribute**: An identifier for a single or multivalued data element that is associated with a directory [**object**](#gt_object). An [**object**](#gt_object) consists of its [**attributes**](#gt_attribute) and their values. For example, cn (common name), street (street address), and mail (email addresses) can all be [**attributes**](#gt_attribute) of a user object. An [**attribute's**](#gt_attribute) schema, including the syntax of its values, is defined in an attributeSchema [**object**](#gt_object).

<a id="gt_autoenrollment"></a>
**autoenrollment**: An automated process that performs [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) [**enrollment**](#gt_certificate-enrollment) and renewal. For more information about autoenrollment behavior, see [MS-CERSOD](#Section_1.3).

<a id="gt_certificate"></a>
**certificate**: A certificate is a collection of attributes and extensions that can be stored persistently. The set of attributes in a certificate can vary depending on the intended usage of the certificate. A certificate securely binds a public key to the entity that holds the corresponding private key. A certificate is commonly used for authentication and secure exchange of information on open networks, such as the Internet, extranets, and intranets. Certificates are digitally signed by the issuing [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) and can be issued for a user, a computer, or a service. The most widely accepted format for certificates is defined by the ITU-T X.509 version 3 international standards. For more information about attributes and extensions, see [[RFC3280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90414) and [[X509]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90590) sections 7 and 8.

<a id="gt_certificate-enrollment"></a>
**certificate enrollment**: The process of acquiring a digital certificate from a [**certificate authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca), which typically requires an end entity to first makes itself known to the CA (either directly, or through a registration authority). This certificate and its associated [**private key**](#gt_private-key) establish a trusted identity for an entity that is using the [**public key**](#gt_public-key)–based services and applications. Also referred to as simply "enrollment".

<a id="gt_certificate-renewal-request"></a>
**certificate renewal request**: An enrollment request for a new certificate where the request is signed using an existing certificate. The renewal request can use the key pair from the existing certificate or a new key pair. After the new certificate has been issued, it is meant (but not required) to replace the older certificate (a renewed certificate).

<a id="gt_certificate-template"></a>
**certificate template**: A list of attributes that define a blueprint for creating an X.509 [**certificate**](#gt_certificate). It is often referred to in non-Microsoft documentation as a "certificate profile". A [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template) is used to define the content and purpose of a digital certificate, including issuance requirements (certificate policies), implemented X.509 extensions such as application policies, key usage, or extended key usage as specified in [X509], and enrollment permissions. Enrollment permissions define the rules by which a [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) will issue or deny certificate requests. In Windows environments, [**certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template) are stored as [**objects**](#gt_object) in the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) and used by Microsoft enterprise [**CAs**](#gt_certification-authority-ca).

<a id="gt_certification-authority-ca"></a>
**certification authority (CA)**: A third party that issues [**public key**](#gt_public-key) [**certificates**](#gt_certificate). Certificates serve to bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide whether to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust is to be transitive. For more information, see [RFC3280].

<a id="gt_common-name-cn"></a>
**common name (CN)**: A string attribute of a [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) that is one component of a distinguished name (DN). In Microsoft Enterprise uses, a CN has to be unique within the forest where it is defined and any forests that share trust with the defining forest. The website or email address of the certificate owner is often used as a common name. Client applications often refer to a [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) by the CN of its signing certificate.

<a id="gt_cryptographic-service-provider-csp"></a>
**cryptographic service provider (CSP)**: A software module that implements cryptographic functions for calling applications that generates digital signatures. Multiple CSPs can be installed. A CSP is identified by a name represented by a NULL-terminated Unicode string.

<a id="gt_digital-signature"></a>
**digital signature**: A message authenticator that is typically derived from a cryptographic operation by using an asymmetric algorithm and private key. When a symmetric algorithm is used for this purpose, the authenticator is typically referred to as a Message Authentication Code (MAC).

<a id="gt_directory"></a>
**directory**: The database that stores information about objects such as users, groups, computers, printers, and the directory service that makes this information available to users and applications.

<a id="gt_discretionary-access-control-list-dacl"></a>
**discretionary access control list (DACL)**: An [**access control list (ACL)**](#gt_access-control-list-acl) that is controlled by the owner of an object and that specifies the access particular users or groups can have to the object.

<a id="gt_distinguished-name-dn"></a>
**distinguished name (DN)**: In [**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap), an LDAP Distinguished Name, as described in [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325) section 4.1.3. The DN of an object is the DN of its parent, preceded by the RDN of the object. For example: CN=David Thompson, OU=Users, DC=Microsoft, DC=COM. For definitions of CN and OU, see [[RFC2256]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=91339) sections 5.4 and 5.12, respectively.

<a id="gt_domain"></a>
**domain**: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a [**domain controller (DC)**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) service. The domain controller provides authentication of members, creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD](../MS-AUTHSOD/MS-AUTHSOD.md) section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

<a id="gt_domain-controller-dc"></a>
**domain controller (DC)**: The service, running on a server, that implements [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory), or the server hosting this service. The service hosts the data store for [**objects**](#gt_object) and interoperates with other [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) to ensure that a local change to an [**object**](#gt_object) replicates correctly across all [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc). When [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is operating as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), the [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) contains full NC replicas of the configuration naming context (config NC), schema naming context (schema NC), and one of the domain NCs in its forest. If the AD DS [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) is a global catalog server (GC server), it contains partial NC replicas of the remaining domain NCs in its forest. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5.2 and [MS-ADTS]. When [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is operating as Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), several AD LDS [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) can run on one server. When [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is operating as AD DS, only one AD DS [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) can run on one server. However, several AD LDS [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) can coexist with one AD DS [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) on one server. The AD LDS [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) contains full NC replicas of the config NC and the schema NC in its forest. The domain controller is the server side of Authentication Protocol Domain Support [MS-APDS](../MS-APDS/MS-APDS.md).

<a id="gt_enroll"></a>
**enroll**: To request and acquire a digital certificate from a [**certificate authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca). This is typically accomplished through a [**certificate enrollment**](#gt_certificate-enrollment) process.

<a id="gt_enroll-on-behalf-of-eobo"></a>
**Enroll On Behalf Of (EOBO)**: A proxy enrollment process in which one user, typically an administrator, enrolls for a [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) for a second user by using the administrator credentials.

<a id="gt_enrollment-permissions"></a>
**enrollment permissions**: A list of administrator-defined rights or [**access control lists (ACLs)**](#gt_access-control-list-acl) that define the capability of a given client (user, machine, or device). [**Enrollment permissions**](#gt_enrollment-permissions) can define a client capability to read a [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template), write a [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template), enroll for a [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) based on a specified [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template), auto-enroll for a [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) based on a specified [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template), or change permissions on a [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template). [**Enrollment permissions**](#gt_enrollment-permissions) are stored on a [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template) and are enforced by the [**certificate authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca). For more information, see [[MSFT-TEMPLATES]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90209).

<a id="gt_enterprise-certificate-authority-enterprise-ca"></a>
**enterprise certificate authority (enterprise CA)**: A [**certificate authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) that is a member of a [**domain**](#gt_domain) and that uses the [**domain's**](#gt_domain) [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) service to store policy, authentication, and other information related to the operation of the [**CA**](#gt_certification-authority-ca). Specifically, the enterprise CA is a server implementation of the Windows Client Certificate Enrollment Protocol that uses the certificate template data structure (see [MS-CRTD](#Section_4c6950e41dc24ae398c3b8919bb73822)) in its CA policy algorithm implementation.

<a id="gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn"></a>
**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**: In [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory), a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that identifies a [**domain**](#gt_domain).

<a id="gt_key"></a>
**key**: In cryptography, a generic term used to refer to cryptographic data that is used to initialize a cryptographic algorithm. [**Keys**](#gt_key) are also sometimes referred to as keying material.

<a id="gt_key-archival"></a>
**key archival**: The process by which the entity requesting the [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) also submits the [**private key**](#gt_private-key) during the process. The [**private key**](#gt_private-key) is encrypted such that only a [**key recovery agent**](#gt_key-recovery-agent-kra) can obtain it, preventing accidental disclosure, but preserving a copy in case the entity is unable or unwilling to decrypt data.

<a id="gt_key-recovery-agent-kra"></a>
**key recovery agent (KRA)**: A user, machine, or registration authority that has enrolled and obtained a key recovery certificate. A [**KRA**](#gt_key-recovery-agent-kra) is any entity that possesses a [**KRA**](#gt_key-recovery-agent-kra) [**private key**](#gt_private-key) and [**certificate**](#gt_certificate). For more information on [**KRAs**](#gt_key-recovery-agent-kra) and the archival process, see [[MSFT-ARCHIVE]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90177).

<a id="gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap"></a>
**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**: The primary access protocol for [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory). Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an industry-standard protocol, established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which allows users to query and update information in a directory service (DS), as described in [MS-ADTS]. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol can be either version 2 [[RFC1777]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90290) or version 3 [[RFC3377]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91337).

<a id="gt_netbios-name"></a>
**NetBIOS name**: A 16-byte address that is used to identify a NetBIOS resource on the network. For more information, see [[RFC1001]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90260) and [[RFC1002]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90261).

<a id="gt_object"></a>
**object**: In [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory), an entity consisting of a set of attributes, each attribute with a set of associated values. For more information, see [MS-ADTS]. See also directory object.

<a id="gt_object-identifier-oid"></a>
**object identifier (OID)**: In the context of a directory service, a number identifying an object class or [**attribute**](#gt_attribute). Object identifiers are issued by the ITU and form a hierarchy. An OID is represented as a dotted decimal string (for example, "1.2.3.4"). For more information on OIDs, see [[X660]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90592) and [RFC3280] Appendix A. OIDs are used to uniquely identify certificate templates available to the [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca). Within a [**certificate**](#gt_certificate), OIDs are used to identify standard extensions, as described in [RFC3280] section 4.2.1.x, as well as non-standard extensions.

<a id="gt_private-key"></a>
**private key**: One of a pair of keys used in public-key cryptography. The private key is kept secret and is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted with the corresponding public key. For an introduction to this concept, see [[CRYPTO]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89841) section 1.8 and [[IEEE1363]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89899) section 3.1.

<a id="gt_public-key"></a>
**public key**: One of a pair of keys used in public-key cryptography. The public key is distributed freely and published as part of a digital certificate. For an introduction to this concept, see [CRYPTO] section 1.8 and [IEEE1363] section 3.1.

<a id="gt_registration-authority-ra"></a>
**registration authority (RA)**: The authority in a PKI that verifies user requests for a digital certificate and indicates to the [**certificate authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) that it is acceptable to issue a [**certificate**](#gt_certificate).

<a id="gt_revocation"></a>
**revocation**: The process of invalidating a certificate. For more details, see [RFC3280] section 3.3.

<a id="gt_securemultipurpose-internet-mail-extensions-smime"></a>
**Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)**: A standard for encrypted and digitally signed electronic mail that allows users to send encrypted messages and authenticate received messages.

<a id="gt_security-descriptor"></a>
**security descriptor**: A data structure containing the security information associated with a securable [**object**](#gt_object). A [**security descriptor**](#gt_security-descriptor) identifies an [**object's**](#gt_object) owner by its [**security identifier (SID)**](#gt_security-identifier-sid). If access control is configured for the [**object**](#gt_object), its [**security descriptor**](#gt_security-descriptor) contains a [**discretionary access control list (DACL)**](#gt_discretionary-access-control-list-dacl) with [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) for the security principals who are allowed or denied access. Applications use this structure to set and query an [**object's**](#gt_object) security status. The [**security descriptor**](#gt_security-descriptor) is used to guard access to an [**object**](#gt_object) as well as to control which type of auditing takes place when the [**object**](#gt_object) is accessed. The [**security descriptor**](#gt_security-descriptor) format is specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.4.6; a string representation of [**security descriptors**](#gt_security-descriptor), called SDDL, is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.5.1.

<a id="gt_security-identifier-sid"></a>
**security identifier (SID)**: An identifier for security principals that is used to identify an account or a group. Conceptually, the [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is composed of an account authority portion (typically a [**domain**](#gt_domain)) and a smaller integer representing an identity relative to the account authority, termed the relative identifier (RID). The [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) format is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2; a string representation of [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2 and [MS-AZOD](../MS-AZOD/MS-AZOD.md) section 1.1.1.2.

<a id="gt_symmetric-algorithm"></a>
**symmetric algorithm**: A cryptographic algorithm that uses one secret key that can be shared between authorized parties. The key has to be kept secret between communicating parties. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption. For an introduction to this concept and terminology, see [CRYPTO] section 1.5, [IEEE1363] section 3, and [[SP800-56A]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90525) section 3.1.

<a id="gt_symmetric-key"></a>
**symmetric key**: A secret key used with a cryptographic symmetric algorithm. The key needs to be known to all communicating parties. For an introduction to this concept, see [CRYPTO] section 1.5.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

[MSFT-CVE-2022-26931] Microsoft Corporation, "Windows Kerberos Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability", CVE-2022-26931 May 10, 2022, [https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-26931](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2194567)

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

This specification defines the syntax and interpretation of [**certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template). Certificate templates are data structures that specify how [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) requests and certificates are constructed and issued as documented in [MS-WCCE](../MS-WCCE/MS-WCCE.md). The structures also provide settings that influence the behavior of the computer certificate [**autoenrollment**](#gt_autoenrollment) feature that is described in [MS-CERSOD](#Section_1.3). Certificate templates are stored as [**objects**](#gt_object) in [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory).

The Windows Client Certificate Enrollment Protocol, as specified in [MS-WCCE], is documented separately. Windows Client Certificate Enrollment Protocol is the protocol by which clients request certificates from the [**CA**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) and by which any issued certificates are returned to the client. Certificate templates can be thought of as playing a part in that protocol because of their abilities to constrain behaviors of the CAs; otherwise, interactions between templates and the Windows Client Certificate Enrollment Protocol are not limited. A client in the Windows Client Certificate Enrollment Protocol can specify a template for the CA to use in building a certificate, but in that context, a template is just another complex data structure that is passed as a parameter to a Windows Client Certificate Enrollment Protocol method.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols and Other Structures

When used, [**certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template) control the behavior of the [**CA**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) that is accessed by the Windows Client Certificate Enrollment Protocol, as specified in [MS-WCCE](../MS-WCCE/MS-WCCE.md), by specifying [**enrollment**](#gt_certificate-enrollment) policies. If templates are not used, the CA behavior and the conduct of the Windows Client Certificate Enrollment Protocol are unconstrained. [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap), as specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md), is the protocol that retrieves the certificate templates. The process of storing templates in the [**directory**](#gt_directory) is an implementation-specific detail and is not specified in this document.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Applicability Statement

The data structure specified in this protocol specification is applicable to an environment that enables clients to interact with a [**CA**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) to [**enroll**](#gt_enroll) or manage X.509 [**certificates**](#gt_certificate). [**Certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template) are only appropriate in an [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) [**domain**](#gt_domain) configuration, as specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md). The protocol (carrying templates) is only used to communicate from computers in the domain to a [**domain controller (DC)**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) for the domain.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Versioning and Localization

To determine the [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template) schema version, clients and servers read the [msPKI-Template-Schema-Version](#Section_2.16) [**attribute**](#gt_attribute) on the certificate template [**object**](#gt_object). For more information, see section 2.16.<1>

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

For schema details of this attribute, see [MS-ADA1](../MS-ADA1/MS-ADA1.md) section 2.231.

<a id="Section_2.5"></a>
## 2.5 ntSecurityDescriptor Attribute

The ntSecurityDescriptor attribute ([MS-ADA3](../MS-ADA3/MS-ADA3.md) section 2.37) is a [**security descriptor**](#gt_security-descriptor) as specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.4.6.<7> The [**discretionary access control list (DACL)**](#gt_discretionary-access-control-list-dacl) field of the security descriptor is an access control list (ACL) (as specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.5) that specifies the permission set for this [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template). Each access control entry ([**ACE**](#gt_access-control-entry-ace)) ([MS-DTYP] section 2.4.4) in the ACL specifies access rights.

The data structure in this [**attribute**](#gt_attribute) supports all types of ACE. However, the Windows Client Certificate Enrollment Protocol uses only two predefined permissions: Enroll and AutoEnroll. The AutoEnroll permission instructs the Windows [**autoenrollment**](#gt_autoenrollment) client to [**enroll**](#gt_enroll) for that template automatically.

<a id="Section_2.5.1"></a>
### 2.5.1 Determining Enrollment Permission of an End Entity for a Template

The following processing rules are to determine the [**enrollment**](#gt_certificate-enrollment) for end entities on a [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template). The protocol behavior for these permissions is specified in [MS-WCCE](../MS-WCCE/MS-WCCE.md) section 3.2.2.6.2.1.4.3 Verify End Entity Permissions.

**Input Parameters:**

- **Template_ntSecurityDescriptor**: The ntSecurityDescriptor [**attribute**](#gt_attribute) of the input template.

**Output Parameter:** This parameter can be either TRUE or FALSE.

**Processing Rules**:

An entity ([**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) user or group) has [**enrollment permission**](#gt_enrollment-permissions) and output parameter is set to TRUE if the [**DACL**](#gt_discretionary-access-control-list-dacl) of the [**security descriptor**](#gt_security-descriptor) that is stored in input parameter **Template_ntSecurityDescriptor** contains an [**ACE**](#gt_access-control-entry-ace) that satisfies either one of the following sets of characteristics:

It has an [**object**](#gt_object) allowed ACE ([MS-DTYP] section 2.4.4.3) that satisfies all the following conditions:

- The **Requester_SID** input parameter is identical to the SID associated with this ACE.
- The **AceType** field of the **ACE_HEADER** structure ([MS-DTYP] section 2.4.4.1) is ACCESS_ALLOWED_OBJECT_ACE_TYPE (0x05). This implies that it is an **ACCESS_ALLOWED_OBJECT_ACE** structure ([MS-DTYP] section 2.4.4.3).
- The **Mask** field of the **ACCESS_ALLOWED_OBJECT_ACE** structure MUST have the bits set as specified by the X in the following diagram.
```mermaid
packet-beta
  8-31: "X"
```

- The **ObjectType** field of the ACCESS_ALLOWED_OBJECT_ACE structure MUST be identical to the Enroll GUID in the following table.
**Or,**

It has an allowed ACE that satisfies all the following conditions**:**

- The Requester SID input parameter is identical to the SID associated with this ACE.

- The **Mask** field of the **ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE** structure MUST have the bits set as specified by the X in the following diagram.
```mermaid
packet-beta
  8-31: "X"
```

An entity is denied enrollment permissions if the DACL of the security descriptor that is stored in input parameter **Template_ntSecurityDescriptor** has the same ACE as previously described, except that the **AceType** field is set to ACCESS_DENIED_OBJECT_ACE_TYPE (0x06).

<a id="Section_2.5.2"></a>

Each list element MUST be in the following format:

intNum, <strCSP>

where intNum is an integer that specifies the priority order in which the system administrator wants the client to use the CSPs listed, and <strCSP> is the CSP name.

The implication of this list of CSPs is that any one of the listed CSPs is acceptable to the system administrator but that a preference is indicated by the value of intNum if a client has more than one of those CSPs. The security implications of violating this expressed priority are up to the system administrator who established that priority ranking to determine and to document.

# 4 Security Considerations

<a id="Section_4.1"></a>
## 4.1 Policy

[**Certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template), including their [**access control lists (ACLs)**](#gt_access-control-list-acl), express policy by which the [**enterprise certificate authority (enterprise CA)**](#gt_enterprise-certificate-authority-enterprise-ca) policy algorithm controls which [**certificates**](#gt_certificate) to issue to end entities in an organization. It is the job of the administrator to translate corporate policy into certificate template contents and ACLs.

<a id="Section_4.2"></a>
## 4.2 Access Control

The [**ACL**](#gt_access-control-list-acl) of a [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template) can grant one permission that the default [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) server policy algorithm consults: the [**enrollment permissions**](#gt_enrollment-permissions). If an entity has the enrollment permission for a certificate type and requests that certificate, the [**enterprise certificate authority (enterprise CA)**](#gt_enterprise-certificate-authority-enterprise-ca) policy algorithm causes the certificate server to issue that kind of certificate to that entity.

One kind of certificate that can be issued is the Enrollment Agent certificate, which is a particularly powerful certificate. Because an Enrollment Agent is allowed to specify certificates to be issued to any subject, it can bypass corporate security policy. As a result, administrators need to be especially careful when allowing subjects to [**enroll**](#gt_enroll) for Enrollment Agent certificates.

<a id="Section_4.3"></a>
## 4.3 Auditing

It might be appropriate to use auditing mechanisms provided by the [**directory**](#gt_directory) storing [**certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template) [**objects**](#gt_object) in order to monitor important types of access like writing to the certificate templates.
