# 1 Introduction

The Tethering Control Channel Protocol (TCC) facilitates the sharing of a server’s network connection with one or more clients over Bluetooth transport. This Protocol allows a client to send control messages to a sharing-capable server to request to share a server's Internet connection. The control message informs the server that a client is interested in tethering, and the server can then bring up a Wi-Fi access point for the client to connect to. At the point that the access point has been set up or is not able to be set up, the server responds to the client with the appropriate Wi-Fi connection credentials (SSID and Password) and specifies the tethering configuration settings or an error code denoting the reason that the connection failed.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_ascii"></a>
**ASCII**: The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is an 8-bit character-encoding scheme based on the English alphabet. ASCII codes represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other devices that work with text. ASCII refers to a single 8-bit ASCII character or an array of 8-bit ASCII characters with the high bit of each character set to zero.

<a id="gt_basic-service-set-identifier-bssid"></a>
**basic service set identifier (BSSID)**: A 48-bit structure that is used to identify an entity such as the access point in a wireless network. This is typically a MAC address.

<a id="gt_display-name"></a>
**display name**: A text string that is used to identify a principal or other object in the user interface. Also referred to as title.

<a id="gt_encryption"></a>
**encryption**: In cryptography, the process of obscuring information to make it unreadable without special knowledge.

<a id="gt_encryption-key"></a>
**encryption key**: One of the input parameters to an [**encryption**](#gt_encryption) algorithm. Generally speaking, an encryption algorithm takes as input a clear-text message and a key, and results in a cipher-text message. The corresponding decryption algorithm takes a cipher-text message, and the key, and results in the original clear-text message.

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_hash-based-message-authentication-code-hmac"></a>
**Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)**: A mechanism for message authentication using cryptographic hash functions. HMAC can be used with any iterative cryptographic hash function (for example, MD5 and SHA-1) in combination with a secret shared key. The cryptographic strength of HMAC depends on the properties of the underlying hash function.

<a id="gt_network-byte-order"></a>
**network byte order**: The order in which the bytes of a multiple-byte number are transmitted on a network, most significant byte first (in big-endian storage). This may or may not match the order in which numbers are normally stored in memory for a particular processor.

<a id="gt_paired-relationship"></a>
**paired relationship**: In a Bluetooth communication scenario, two devices that have established a relationship through the creation of a shared secret known as a link key. The link key enables confirmation of device identity and is used to maintain security across devices.

<a id="gt_passphrase"></a>
**passphrase**: One or more words entered as a security setting to enable device or identity authentication.

<a id="gt_radio-frequency-communications-rfcomm"></a>
**radio frequency communications (RFCOMM)**: A protocol that provides serial port emulation of EIA-232 (formerly RS-232) control signals over the Bluetooth baseband layer. RFCOMM is used to create a virtual serial data stream to enable binary data transport.

<a id="gt_service-discovery-protocol-sdp"></a>
**Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)**: This protocol allows a device to discover services (and their associated configuration settings) offered by other devices. A service is identified by a universally unique identifier (UUID) where recognized services, such as Bluetooth profiles, are assigned a short form UUID (16 bits rather than 128).

<a id="gt_service-set-identifier-ssid"></a>
**service set identifier (SSID)**: A sequence of characters that names a wireless local area network (WLAN).

<a id="gt_tether"></a>
**tether**: Enables a device to gain access to the Internet by establishing a connection with another device that is connected to the Internet.

<a id="gt_timestamp"></a>
**timestamp**: A condition of a digital signature that indicates whether the signature was created with a valid certificate that has expired or was created with a certificate that had expired already. If the certificate expired after the signature was created, the signature can be trusted. If it expired before the signature was created, it cannot be trusted.

<a id="gt_trust"></a>
**trust**: To accept another authority's statements for the purposes of authentication and authorization, especially in the case of a relationship between two domains. If domain A trusts domain B, domain A accepts domain B's authentication and authorization statements for principals represented by security principal objects in domain B; for example, the list of groups to which a particular user belongs. As a noun, a [**trust**](#gt_trust) is the relationship between two domains described in the previous sentence.

<a id="gt_type-length-value-tlv"></a>
**type-length-value (TLV)**: A method of organizing data that involves a Type code (16-bit), a specified length of a Value field (16-bit), and the data in the Value field (variable).

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

The Tethering Control Channel Protocol facilitates the sharing of a server's Internet connection with one or more clients that are using Wi-Fi over Bluetooth transport. To initiate the connection, a client sends a request to a server to indicate that it is seeking to share the server's Internet connection. When the connection is successful, the server responds to the client with the appropriate Wi-Fi information. In the event that connection sharing is unsuccessful, the server returns an error message.

To use this protocol, the client is required to establish a secure, authenticated connection with the server that is capable of [**tethering**](#gt_aec98994-fbb4-43fb-ac7d-0ef37b747c9b). The client sends a request to the server to initiate tethering and to obtain the tethering configuration settings. In response, the server enables tethering, if it is not already enabled, and replies to the client with the tethering configuration settings, including the Wi-Fi [**service set identifier (SSID)**](#gt_service-set-identifier-ssid), [**basic service set identifier (BSSID)**](#gt_basic-service-set-identifier-bssid), [**passphrase**](#gt_passphrase), and [**display name**](#gt_display-name). The client uses these settings to connect to the tethering network. In the event that the server is unable to successfully enable tethering, the server sends the appropriate error message to the client.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

None.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Tethering Control Channel Protocol depends on a secure and authenticated communication channel between the client and server. If the client and server do not have a Bluetooth pairing relationship, three 256-bit keys (K1, K2, and K3) MUST be generated and be known to the client and server to be used in establishing the communication channel. The keys MUST be constructed following the recommendations for random number generation as described in [[NIST-SP800-90C]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=856909) and specified in [[RFC4086]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90456).

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is only applicable when the client initiates the [**tethering**](#gt_aec98994-fbb4-43fb-ac7d-0ef37b747c9b) request. The client is required to support connecting to Wi-Fi networks and the server is required to support Internet connection sharing.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This protocol covers versioning issues in the following areas:

**Protocol Versions:** The Tethering Control Channel protocol supports future enhancements as defined in sections [3.1.5.5](#Section_3.1.5.5) and [3.2.5.3](#Section_3.2.5.3). See also Messages (section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3)).

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

None.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

To use the Tethering Control Channel Protocol, a byte stream connection MUST be established by using [**radio frequency communications (RFCOMM)**](#gt_radio-frequency-communications-rfcomm) [[BT-RFCOMM]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294277) between the client and server. To identify a [**tethering**](#gt_aec98994-fbb4-43fb-ac7d-0ef37b747c9b)-capable server using RFCOMM, the client MUST use the Bluetooth [**Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)**](#gt_service-discovery-protocol-sdp) [[BT-SDP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294278).

Tethering-capable servers MUST be identified through SDP by using the [**globally unique identifier (GUID)**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) {232E51D8-91FF-4c24-AC0F-9EE055DA30A5}. To ensure that the RFCOMM communication is authenticated, the client MUST have either a Bluetooth [**pairing relationship**](#gt_d1d16361-392f-44e2-b3bc-5a747f0b1d7c) with the server, or in the **BringUpStartRequest** message (section [2.2.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.1)) an [**HMAC**](#gt_hash-based-message-authentication-code-hmac) structure (section [2.2.2.6](#Section_2.2.2.6)) and a **Timestamp** structure (section [2.2.2.12](#Section_2.2.2.12)) SHOULD<1> be included.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

The protocol uses a common [**type-length-value (TLV)**](#gt_type-length-value-tlv) encoding schema for all messages. All strings are in Unicode UTF-8 format unless otherwise specified.

# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Client Details

In the Tethering Control Channel Protocol, the client role performs one primary operation and that is to send a **BringUpStartRequest** message (section [2.2.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.1)) to the server and to wait for the server’s response. When the client receives a **BringUpSuccessResponse** message (section [2.2.3.2](#Section_2.2.3.2)) or **BringUpFailureResponse** message (section [2.2.3.4](#Section_2.2.3.4)) from the server, the client sends the contents of the message to the higher layer, disconnects the transport, notifies the higher layer that it has completed the operation, and terminates the connection.

![Client message processing](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: Client message processing

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

**MessageTimer:** Specifies the time-out interval for the request operation. The interval is set to one minute.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The Tethering Control Channel Protocol is initialized after the transport protocol has created a communication channel with the server. After the communication channel is initialized, the client sends a **BringUpStartRequest** message (section [2.2.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.1)) to the server. If the client is not paired to the server, the **BringUpStartRequest** MUST contain the optional **HMAC** and **Timestamp** fields. The client SHOULD<6> include the **HMAC** and **Timestamp** fields regardless of [**pairing relationship**](#gt_d1d16361-392f-44e2-b3bc-5a747f0b1d7c). Providing the **HMAC** and **Timestamp** field regardless of pairing state provides resiliency when the server has broken the pairing relationship without the client’s knowledge.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

<a id="Section_3.1.4.1"></a>
#### 3.1.4.1 Cancellation

The higher layer can terminate the client’s connection while the client is waiting for a response from the server.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

Messages in the Tethering Control Channel Protocol are identified by the values specified in the **CommonHeader** structure (section [2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2)) contained in each message. A message is only processed after the entire contents of the message have been received as indicated by the value of the **Length** field specified within the **CommonHeader**.

When the client receives a message, the **MessageTimer** (see section [3.1.2](#Section_3.2.2)) is started or restarted.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>
#### 3.1.5.1 BringUpSuccessResponse

When the client receives a **BringUpSuccessResponse** message (section [2.2.3.2](#Section_2.2.3.2)), the client sends the contents of the message to the higher layer and terminates the connection.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2"></a>
#### 3.1.5.2 BringUpSuccessResponseUnpaired

When a client receives a **BringUpSuccessResponseUnpaired** message (section [2.2.3.3](#Section_2.2.3.3)), the client first validates that the [**HMAC**](#gt_hash-based-message-authentication-code-hmac) is correct. After verifying the **HMAC** is correct, the encrypted payload is decrypted and reprocessed as a **BringUpSuccessResponse**.<7>

<a id="Section_3.1.5.3"></a>
#### 3.1.5.3 BringUpFailureResponse

When the client receives a **BringUpFailureResponse** message (section [2.2.3.4](#Section_2.2.3.4)), the client sends the contents of the message to the higher layer and terminates the connection.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.4"></a>
#### 3.1.5.4 Failure Messages

When the client receives a **BringUpStartRequest** message (section [2.2.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.1)) or **ProtocolErrorResponse** message (section [2.2.3.5](#Section_2.2.3.5)), the client indicates to the higher layer that a protocol failure event has occurred and terminates the connection.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.5"></a>
#### 3.1.5.5 Other Messages

When the client receives a message with an unrecognized message type, that is, a **MessageId** value that is not within the expected range defined in section [2.2.1.1](#Section_2.2.1.1), the client sends a **ProtocolErrorResponse** message (section [2.2.3.5](#Section_2.2.3.5)) with the **Value** field of the **MessageType** structure (section [2.2.2.8](#Section_2.2.2.8)) set to the unrecognized value.

When the client receives a message that cannot be parsed according to the message syntax specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2), the client indicates to the higher layer that a protocol error has occurred and terminates the connection.

<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>
### 3.1.6 Timer Events

After the **MessageTimer** (section [3.1.2](#Section_3.2.2)) expires, the client sends the time-out to the higher layer then disconnects and terminates the connection.

<a id="Section_3.1.7"></a>
### 3.1.7 Other Local Events

<a id="Section_3.1.7.1"></a>
#### 3.1.7.1 Disconnect Event of Transport Channel

If the transport channel becomes disconnected, the client indicates to the higher layer that a transport failure has occurred and terminates the connection.

<a id="Section_3.2"></a>
## 3.2 Server Details

In the Tethering Control Channel Protocol, initialization occurs when a client makes a connection to the server and the server creates an instance of the server role for each connection with a client. The server MAY handle multiple clients simultaneously by having an instance of the server role for each client.

![Server message processing](media/image3.png)

Figure 3: Server message processing

**Note** When the server is in the STARTING state, the server MUST NOT process messages.

<a id="Section_3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves.

The following elements are specific to this protocol:

**State:** Indicates the server state, either IDLE or STARTING.

**Tethering Settings:** A data set that contains the following items:

- **SSID:** A Wi-Fi [**SSID**](#gt_service-set-identifier-ssid) which is a byte blob of 0 to 32 bytes as defined in [[IEEE802.11-2012]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=306038).

### 3.2.2 Timers

**ServerTimer:** Specifies the time-out interval for the response to the client. The interval is set to one minute.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

The server is initialized when the transport protocol indicates that a client has connected. The initial state for the server is set to IDLE.

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

<a id="Section_3.2.4.1"></a>
#### 3.2.4.1 Shutdown

The higher-layer can shut down the server at any time. The server disconnects the transport protocol at shutdown.

<a id="Section_3.2.4.2"></a>
#### 3.2.4.2 Tethering Started or Failed to Start

When the server indicates to the higher layer that [**tethering**](#gt_aec98994-fbb4-43fb-ac7d-0ef37b747c9b) has to be started, the higher layer responds either by confirming that tethering has been started, or that tethering failed to start.

When the higher layer confirms that tethering has been started, the higher layer provides the current **Tethering Settings**. If the server does not have a [**pairing relationship**](#gt_d1d16361-392f-44e2-b3bc-5a747f0b1d7c) with the client, then the server MUST send a **BringUpSuccessResponseUnpaired** message (section [2.2.3.3](#Section_2.2.3.3)). If the client previously included the [**HMAC**](#gt_hash-based-message-authentication-code-hmac) and **Timestamp** in the **BringUpStartRequest** message (section [2.2.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.1)), the server SHOULD<8> send a **BringUpSuccessResponseUnpaired** message regardless of pairing state. If the server does not send a **BringUpSuccessResponseUnpaired** message, the server sends a **BringUpSuccessResponse** message (section [2.2.3.2](#Section_2.2.3.2)) that contains the **Tethering Settings** and returns to the IDLE state.

If the higher layer failed to start tethering, the higher layer provides a reason for the failure. The server sends a **BringUpFailureResponse** message (section [2.2.3.4](#Section_2.2.3.4)) that contains the reason for the failure and returns to the IDLE state.

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

Messages in the Tethering Control Channel Protocol are identified by the values specified in the **CommonHeader** structure (section [2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2)) contained in each message. A message is only processed after the entire contents of the message have been received as indicated by the value of the **Length** field specified within the **CommonHeader**.

When the server receives a message, the **ServerTimer** (see section [3.2.2](#Section_3.2.2)) is started or restarted.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1"></a>
#### 3.2.5.1 BringUpStartRequest

When the server is in the IDLE state and receives a **BringUpStartRequest** message (section [2.2.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.1)), the server MUST check that the client is [**trusted**](#gt_trust).

If there is no [**pairing relationship**](#gt_d1d16361-392f-44e2-b3bc-5a747f0b1d7c) between the client and the server, the **BringUpStartRequest** sent by the client MUST include the [**HMAC**](#gt_hash-based-message-authentication-code-hmac) and **Timestamp**. The server MUST validate that the [**timestamp**](#gt_timestamp) is within some allowable skew (recommended 5 minutes). If it is not, the server MUST reply with a **BringupFailureResponse** with TimestampOutOfSync (9) error (section [2.2.1.2](#Section_2.2.1.2)). It MUST also validate that the **HMAC** is as expected. The **HMAC** MUST be computed using SHA-256 and a 32-byte pre-shared key (K1). If the **HMAC** is not as expected, the server should reply with a **BringupFailureResponse** with the SecurityFailure (10) error (section 2.2.1.2).

If the **HMAC** and **Timestamp** match the expected values, or there is a pairing relationship between the client and server, then the server enters the STARTING state and indicates to the higher layer that [**tethering**](#gt_aec98994-fbb4-43fb-ac7d-0ef37b747c9b) has to be started.

When the server is in the STARTING state, it MUST NOT process messages.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2"></a>
#### 3.2.5.2 Failure Messages

When the server receives a **BringupFailureResponse**, **BringUpSuccessResponse** or **ProtocolErrorResponse** message (section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3)), the server indicates to the higher layer that a protocol failure event has occurred and terminates the connection.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.3"></a>
#### 3.2.5.3 Other Messages

When the server receives a message with an unrecognized message type, that is, a **MessageId** value that is not within the expected range defined in section [2.2.1.1](#Section_2.2.1.1), the server sends a **ProtocolErrorResponse** message (section [2.2.3.5](#Section_2.2.3.5)) with the **Value** field of the **MessageType** structure (section [2.2.2.8](#Section_2.2.2.8)) set to the unrecognized value.

When the server receives a message that cannot be parsed according to the message syntax specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2), the server indicates to the higher layer that a protocol error has occurred and terminates the connection.

<a id="Section_3.2.6"></a>
### 3.2.6 Timer Events

After the **ServerTimer** (section [3.2.2](#Section_3.2.2)) expires, the server disconnects from the client and terminates the connection.

<a id="Section_3.2.7"></a>
### 3.2.7 Other Local Events

<a id="Section_3.2.7.1"></a>
#### 3.2.7.1 Disconnect Event of Transport Channel

If the transport channel becomes disconnected, the server indicates to the higher layer that a transport failure has occurred and terminates the connection.
