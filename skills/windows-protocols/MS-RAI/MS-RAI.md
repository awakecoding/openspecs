# 1 Introduction

The Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol is a set of [**Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)**](#gt_distributed-component-object-model-dcom) interfaces, as specified in [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md), for initiating a [**Remote Assistance connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) to another computer in a [**domain**](#gt_domain). The Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol allows an authorized [**expert**](#gt_expert) to start [**Remote Assistance**](#gt_remote-assistance-ra) on a remote [**novice**](#gt_novice) computer to retrieve data that is required to make a Remote Assistance connection from the expert computer to the novice computer.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_class-identifier-clsid"></a>
**class identifier (CLSID)**: A GUID that identifies a software component; for instance, a DCOM object class or a COM class.

<a id="gt_computer-name"></a>
**computer name**: The DNS or NetBIOS name.

<a id="gt_distributed-component-object-model-dcom"></a>
**Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)**: The Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) specification that defines how components communicate over networks, as specified in [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md).

<a id="gt_domain"></a>
**domain**: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a domain controller (DC) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting the Active Directory service. The domain controller provides authentication of members, creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD](../MS-AUTHSOD/MS-AUTHSOD.md) section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

<a id="gt_domain-name"></a>
**domain name**: A domain name or a NetBIOS name that identifies a [**domain**](#gt_domain).

<a id="gt_expert"></a>
**expert**: The side of a [**Remote Assistance connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) that is able to view the remote screen of the other computer in order to provide help.

<a id="gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn"></a>
**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**: An unambiguous domain name that gives an absolute location in the Domain Name System's (DNS) hierarchy tree, as defined in [[RFC1035]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90264) section 3.1 and [[RFC2181]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=127732) section 11.

<a id="gt_novice"></a>
**novice**: The side of a [**Remote Assistance connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) that shares its screen with the other computer in order to receive help.

<a id="gt_opnum"></a>
**opnum**: An operation number or numeric identifier that is used to identify a specific [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) method or a method in an interface. For more information, see [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) section 12.5.2.12 or [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

<a id="gt_remote-assistance-ra"></a>
**Remote Assistance (RA)**: A feature of the operating system that allows screen, keyboard, and mouse sharing so that a computer user can be assisted by a remote helper.

<a id="gt_remote-assistance-connection"></a>
**Remote Assistance connection**: A communication framework that is established between two computers that facilitates [**Remote Assistance**](#gt_remote-assistance-ra).

<a id="gt_remote-desktop-protocol-rdp"></a>
**Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**: A multi-channel protocol that allows a user to connect to a computer running Microsoft Terminal Services (TS). RDP enables the exchange of client and server settings and also enables negotiation of common settings to use for the duration of the connection, so that input, graphics, and other data can be exchanged and processed between client and server.

<a id="gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc"></a>
**remote procedure call (RPC)**: A communication protocol used primarily between client and server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message). For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_terminal-services-ts"></a>
**terminal services (TS)**: A service on a server computer that allows delivery of applications, or the desktop itself, to various computing devices. When a user runs an application on a terminal server, the application execution takes place on the server computer and only keyboard, mouse, and display information is transmitted over the network. Each user sees only his or her individual session, which is managed transparently by the server operating system and is independent of any other client session.

<a id="gt_unicode-string"></a>
**Unicode string**: A Unicode 8-bit string is an ordered sequence of 8-bit units, a Unicode 16-bit string is an ordered sequence of 16-bit code units, and a Unicode 32-bit string is an ordered sequence of 32-bit code units. In some cases, it could be acceptable not to terminate with a terminating null character. Unless otherwise specified, all [**Unicode strings**](#gt_unicode-string) follow the UTF-16LE encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [C706] must be used for generating the UUID.

<a id="gt_well-known-endpoint"></a>
**well-known endpoint**: A preassigned, network-specific, stable address for a particular client/server instance. For more information, see [C706].

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol provides a set of [**DCOM**](#gt_distributed-component-object-model-dcom) interfaces that enable an [**expert**](#gt_expert) to retrieve the [**Remote Assistance**](#gt_remote-assistance-ra) connection-specific data from the remote [**novice**](#gt_novice) computer. This Remote Assistance connection-specific data is subsequently used to initiate a [**Remote Assistance connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) as explained in the Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol.

The expert needs to have the IP address or [**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**](#gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn) of the novice computer to use this protocol.

The expert is the DCOM client and the novice is the DCOM server.

Before the expert's DCOM call is executed on the novice computer, DCOM performs a check to verify that the expert is on the list of authorized Remote Assistance helpers on the novice computer.<1>

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol relies on the OLE Automation Protocol [MS-OAUT](../MS-OAUT/MS-OAUT.md), the [**Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)**](#gt_distributed-component-object-model-dcom) Remote Protocol [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md), and on the Microsoft [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc), as specified in the Remote Procedure Call Protocol Extensions [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

The Remote Assistance Protocol [MS-RA](../MS-RA/MS-RA.md) is dependent on both the Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol and the Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md).

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the preceding protocols.

![Relationships between protocols](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Relationships between protocols

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

This protocol is implemented over [**DCOM**](#gt_distributed-component-object-model-dcom) and [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc), and, as a result, has the prerequisites specified in the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) Remote Protocol [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md) and Remote Procedure Call Protocol Extensions [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) as being common to DCOM and RPC interfaces.

The Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol assumes that the [**expert**](#gt_expert) has the IP Address or the [**FQDN**](#gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn) of the [**novice**](#gt_novice) computer.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is used to perform the following functions:

- Using the [**novice**](#gt_novice) IP address or [**FQDN**](#gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn), the [**expert**](#gt_expert) queries the novice for a list of active [**terminal services**](#gt_terminal-services-ts) sessions running on the novice computer. Additional information about each terminal services session—DomainName, UserName, terminal services SessionID, and terminal services SessionState—is also obtained.
- Using the DomainName, UserName, and SessionID of a specific session on the novice computer, the expert queries the novice for a [**Remote Assistance Connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) String. The novice starts [**Remote Assistance**](#gt_remote-assistance-ra) and returns a Remote Assistance Connection String. The novice is now waiting for the expert to make a peer-to-peer connection to its terminal services session.
- After a Remote Assistance Connection String is obtained by the expert, it is used to make a peer-to-peer Remote Assistance connection to the novice's Terminal Service session on the novice computer.
<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas.

**Supported Transports:** This protocol uses the [**DCOM**](#gt_distributed-component-object-model-dcom) technology specified in [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md), which provides capabilities to query for interface versions.

**Protocol Versions:** This protocol is composed of the following two primary DCOM interfaces, which are version 0.0:<2>

- IPCHService
- IRASrv
Both these interfaces offer similar functionality through their methods. An [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) client determines if a method is supported by attempting to invoke the method; if the method is not supported, the RPC server returns the "RPC_S_PROCNUM_OUT_OF_RANGE" error, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.1.1.5.5.

When an [**expert**](#gt_expert) attempts to connect using this protocol, it uses only one of these two interfaces.

The [**novice**](#gt_novice) computer implements at least one of these two interfaces, and can implement both interfaces.

The expert computer negotiates for a given set of server functionality by specifying the [**UUID**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid) corresponding to the wanted RPC interface when binding to the novice.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol does not define any vendor-extensible fields.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

No standards assignments have been received for this protocol. All values used in these extensions are in private ranges specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).

## 2.1 Transport

[**DCOM**](#gt_distributed-component-object-model-dcom) [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md) is used as the transport protocol. The Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol documented here relies upon DCOM [MS-DCOM] authentication and encryption for all protocol messages.

This protocol MUST use these [**universally unique identifier (UUID)**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid) interfaces, as explained in section [1.9](#Section_1.9):

- (833E4200-AFF7-4AC3-AAC2-9F24C1457BCE)
- (833E4100-AFF7-4AC3-AAC2-9F24C1457BCE)
- (833E41AA-AFF7-4AC3-AAC2-9F24C1457BCE)
- (F120A684-B926-447F-9DF4-C966CB785648)
The following two are the [**CLSIDs**](#gt_class-identifier-clsid) of the objects implementing these interfaces, as explained in section 1.9:

- (833E4010-AFF7-4AC3-AAC2-9F24C1457BCE)
- (3C3A70A7-A468-49B9-8ADA-28E11FCCAD5D)
<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Common Data Types

In addition to [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) base types and definitions specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md), additional data types are defined in the following sections.

There are two version-specific forms of the [**Remote Assistance Connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) String, appended with 1 and 2 to differentiate them.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Remote Assistance Connection String 1

The Remote Assistance Connection String 1 contains the [**Remote Desktop Protocol**](#gt_remote-desktop-protocol-rdp) parameters to establish a [**Remote Assistance connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection). The Remote Assistance Connection String 1 is a comma-delimited [**Unicode string**](#gt_unicode-string) comprising the following pieces of data.<3>

<ProtocolVersion>,<protocolType>,<machineAddressList>,<assistantAccountPwd>,

<RASessionID>,<RASessionName>,<RASessionPwd>,<protocolSpecificParms>

The elements are defined as follows.

**ProtocolVersion:** Identifies the protocol version. The value MUST be 65,538.

**protocolType:** Identifies the protocol type. The value MUST be 1.

**machineAddressList:** Identifies network address of server machine. It is a semicolon-delimited list of IPAddress(or [**computer name**](#gt_computer-name)):PortID string pairs. The IPAddress is of type IPV4.

**assistantAccountPwd:** Password for [**Remote Assistance**](#gt_remote-assistance-ra) Account Name. This MUST be set to "*".

**RASessionID:** Remote Assistance session unique identifier.

**RASessionName:** Remote Assistance session name. This MUST be set to "*".

**RASessionPwd:** Remote Assistance session password. This MUST be set to "*".

**protocolSpecificParms:** Parameter specific to a Remote Desktop Protocol.

The following is an example of Remote Assistance Connection String 1.

65538,1,172.31.243.138:3389;MIKE_HOME:3389,*,Uj7RpOlU80SibpRw

RZ9+z1vbh7nIgVn89X1AiKp15Vc=,*,*,RcfwecK8dpcT1fjZ6iQ5M0+q7iU=

The values for the Remote Assistance Connection String 1 entities in the preceding example are as follows.

ProtocolVersion = 65538

protocolType = 1

machineAddressList = 172.31.243.138:3389;MIKE_HOME:3389

assistantAccountPwd = *

RASessionID = Uj7RpOlU80SibpRwRZ9+z1vbh7nIgVn89X1AiKp15Vc=

RASessionName = *

RASessionPwd = *

protocolSpecificParms = RcfwecK8dpcT1fjZ6iQ5M0+q7iU=

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 Remote Assistance Connection String 2

The second type of the [**Remote Assistance Connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) String packet is a [**Unicode string**](#gt_unicode-string) in XML format.<4> The details of this are as follows.

<E>

<A KH="Protocol-specific Parameter" KH2="Protocol-specific Parameter" ID="Authorization String Identifier" />

<C>

<T ID="Transport ID" SID="Session ID">

<L P="Port" N="Server Name" />

</T>

</C>

</E>

The novice (server) generates the KH attribute of the Auth String Node <A> in the Remote Assistance Connection String 2. The expert (client) validates the value of KH during the RDP connection sequence.

The KH value is a base64-encoded string of the SHA1 hash of the **PublicKeyBlob** field of the server certificate received in TS_UD_SC_SEC1. The length, in bytes, of the **PublicKeyBlob** is given by the **wPublicKeyBlobLen** field as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md) sections 2.2.1.4.3 and 2.2.1.4.3.1.1.

In addition to the KH attribute, the novice (server) SHOULD<5> generate the KH2 attribute of the Auth String Node <A> in the Remote Assistance Connection String 2. If this parameter is present in the connection string, the expert (client) validates the value of KH2 during the RDP connection. If this parameter is absent in the connection string, the client uses the KH parameter for validating the server as described in the previous paragraph. The KH2 value is a composite of the hashing algorithm used and the base64 encoded string of the PublicKeyBlob field of the server certificate received in TS_UD_SC_SEC1. The hashing algorithm can be sha256, sha384, or sha512. The hashing algorithm and base64 encoded string of the hash are separated by a colon (:).

The Remote Assistance Connection String 2 starts with the root Node <E>. This root Node contains the following child nodes:

- The Auth String Node <A> has the following attributes.
| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| KH | Parameters specific to a [**Remote Desktop Protocol**](#gt_remote-desktop-protocol-rdp) |
| ID | Authstring identifier |
| KH2 | Parameters specific to a Remote Desktop Protocol |

- The Connector Node <C> has child nodes that give information on the underlying Transport used. This Transport Node <T> has the following attributes.
| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ID | Transport Identifier |
| SID | Session Identifier |

- The Transport Node has Listener child Nodes that give information about the Server IP and port. This Listener node <L> has the following attributes.
| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| P | Port: The dynamic port on which the Remote Assistance connection could happen. |
| N | Server Name: The name/IP address of the server, that is, the [**novice**](#gt_novice) computer. |
| U | URI: The full URI if websocket listener is enabled. The U (URI) is used instead of the P (port) attribute. N (server name) attribute is still included. |

The following is an example of Remote Assistance Connection String 2:

<E>

<A KH="YiKwWUY8Ioq5NB3wAQHSbs5kwrM=" KH2="sha256:wKSAkAV3sBfa9WpuRFJcP9q1twJc6wOBuoJ9tsyXwpk=" ID="8rYm30RBW8/4dAWoUsWbFCF5jno/7jr5t

NpHQc2goLbw4uuBBJvLsU02YYLlBMg5"/>

<C>

<T ID="1" SID="1440550163">

<L P="49749" N="2001:4898:1a:5:79e2:3356:9b22:3470"/>

<L P="49751" N="172.31.250.64"/>

</T>

</C>

</E>

In the preceding example:

- The Auth String Node <A> has the attribute KH="YiKwWUY8Ioq5NB3wAQHSbs5kwrM=", KH2="sha256:wKSAkAV3sBfa9WpuRFJcP9q1twJc6wOBuoJ9tsyXwpk=", and attribute ID = "8rYm30RBW8/4dAWoUsWbFCF5jno/7jr5tNpHQc2goLbw4uuBBJvLsU02YYLlBMg5". In this example, the KH2 value contains the encoded string "wKSAkAV3sBfa9WpuRFJcP9q1twJc6wOBuoJ9tsyXwpk=" and the hashing algorithm used is SHA256.
- The Connector Node <C> has one Transport child Node <T> with the following attributes:
ID = "1"

Session ID - SID = "1440550163"

- The Transport Node has two Listener child Nodes <L> with the following server and port information attributes:
Port - P = "49749"

Server Name - N = "2001:4898:1a:5:79e2:3356:9b22:3470", and

Port - P = "49751"

Server Name - N = "172.31.250.64".

## 3.2 IPCHService Remote Assistance Client Details

The following sections specify client details of the Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol, including abstract data models, timers, and message processing rules.

<a id="Section_3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

The [**expert**](#gt_expert) MUST specify the IP address or [**FQDN**](#gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn) of the [**novice**](#gt_novice) computer to use this protocol.

Using the specified IP address or FQDN of the novice computer, the expert connects to the novice computer and invokes the [RemoteUserSessionInfo](#Section_3.1.4.1.2) method of IPCHService on the remote novice computer and gets back a collection containing the DomainName, UserName, SessionID and SessionState of the [**terminal services**](#gt_terminal-services-ts) sessions from the novice computer.

The expert selects the terminal services session where [**Remote Assistance**](#gt_remote-assistance-ra) is to be offered and by specifying the terminal services Session's DomainName, UserName and SessionID, invokes the [RemoteConnectionParms](#Section_3.1.4.1.1) method of IPCHService on the remote novice computer to obtain the [**Remote Assistance Connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) String.

<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

No protocol timers are required other than those internal ones used in [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) to implement resiliency to network outages, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

The client creates an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) association (or binding) to the server RPC before an RPC method is called. The client can either create a separate association for each method invocation, or it can reuse an association for multiple invocations.

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The following list shows the sequence of steps involved in a [**Remote Assistance Connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) String request:

- The client initiates the conversation with the server by performing DCOM activation, as specified in [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md) section 3.2.4.1.1, of the **PCHService** [**CLSID**](#gt_class-identifier-clsid) specified in section [1.9](#Section_1.9). As a result of the activation, the client gets the **PCHService**'s interface from the server.
- The client then obtains an additional **IPCHService** interface from the **PCHService** interface as specified in [MS-DCOM] section 3.2.4.4.3.
- The client then invokes the [RemoteUserSessionInfo](#Section_3.1.4.1.2) method of the **IPCHService** interface to retrieve an **ISAFSession** interface pointers' collection of type **IPCHCollection**.
- Enumerate the **ISAFSession** interfaces of the server by repeatedly calling the Item method of the **IPCHCollection** interface. The collected list of session information is presented to the [**Remote Assistance**](#gt_remote-assistance-ra) user, by means of an implementation-specific user interface, to decide which session to connect to.
- From the collected **ISAFSession** interface values, a session is chosen by the Remote Assistance user. The SessionID and corresponding DomainName and UserName are passed in a call to the [RemoteConnectionParms](#Section_3.1.4.1.1) method of the **IPCHService** interface. This call returns the Remote Assistance Connection String for the specified session. Sessions with no DomainName or UserName MUST be ignored.
- This Remote Assistance Connection String is valid to begin the Remote Assistance connection.
<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Timer Events

No protocol timer events are required on the client other than the events maintained in the underlying [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) transport.

<a id="Section_3.2.6"></a>
### 3.2.6 Other Local Events

No additional local events are used on the client other than the events maintained in the underlying [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) transport.

<a id="Section_3.3"></a>
## 3.3 IRASrv Remote Assistance Server Details

Review the security considerations listed in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 5.1, as these are also valid for DCOM and DCOM-based protocols.<14>

<a id="Section_5.2"></a>
## 5.2 Index of Security Parameters

There are no security parameters for this protocol.

<a id="Section_6"></a>
# 6 Appendix A: Remote Assistance Invitation File Format

The purpose of the Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol is to obtain the [**Remote Assistance Connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) String using [**DCOM**](#gt_distributed-component-object-model-dcom). However, the implementer is free to use alternative approaches to obtain the connection string. One such alternative approach implemented in Windows is to transmit the Remote Assistance Invitation File over email as an XML file.<15>

The [**expert**](#gt_expert) computer parses the Remote Assistance Invitation File to extract the Remote Assistance Connection String and other information.

There are two version-specific types of the Remote Assistance Invitation File.

The following is a sample Remote Assistance Invitation File of the first type:<16>

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.3: Windows implements [**expert**](#gt_expert) authentication using the Offer [**Remote Assistance**](#gt_remote-assistance-ra) Helpers Group. [**DCOM**](#gt_distributed-component-object-model-dcom) will only allow members of this group to execute the Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol methods.

<2> Section 1.7:

- Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 do not implement IRASrv. A [**novice**](#gt_novice) running one of these versions of Windows cannot be initiated through IRASrv.
- Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 implement IPCHService. A Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 novice can be initiated only through IPCHService.
- A Windows Vista and later and Windows Server 2008 and later expert first attempts to call IRASrv, and if that fails, the expert then attempts to call the IPCHService interface.
- A Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 expert will only attempt to call IPCHService and will not be able to connect to a novice running Windows Vista and later or Windows Server 2008 and later.
<3> Section 2.2.1: This form of the [**Remote Assistance Connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) String is obtained from Remote Assistance running on a Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 novice.

<4> Section 2.2.2: This form of the Remote Assistance Connection String is not available on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

<5> Section 2.2.2: The KH2 attribute is not implemented in Windows XP or later.

<6> Section 3.1.4.1: This interface and its called interfaces, IPCHCollection and ISAFSession, are only called by Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

<7> Section 3.1.4.1: Opnums 3 and 4 are used used locally by Windows, never remotely.

<8> Section 3.1.4.1.1: Access denied error is returned only for Windows XP operating system Service Pack 1 (SP1) and the initial release of Windows Server 2003.

<9> Section 3.1.4.1.2: Access denied error is returned only for Windows XP SP1 and the initial release of Windows Server 2003.

<10> Section 3.1.4.1.2.1: Gaps in the [**opnum**](#gt_opnum) numbering sequence apply to Windows as follows.

| Opnum | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 3-4 | Only used locally by Windows, never remotely. |

<11> Section 3.1.4.1.2.2: Gaps in the opnum numbering sequence apply to Windows as follows.

| Opnum | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 3-4 | Only used locally by Windows, never remotely. |

<12> Section 3.3.4.1: This interface is not implemented in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

<13> Section 3.3.4.1: Gaps in the opnum numbering sequence apply to Windows as follows.

| Opnum | Description |

<14> Section 5.1: For DCOM authentication/authorization in Windows Vista and later and Windows Server 2008 and later, the following are used:

- Authentication Service - RPC_C_AUTHN_WINNT
- Authorization Service - RPC_C_AUTHZ_DEFAULT
- Authentication Level - RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY
- Impersonation Level - RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE
For DCOM authentication/authorization in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, all defaults are used.

<15> Section 6: In Windows, the XML file has the extension MSRCIncident.

<16> Section 6: This version is specific to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

<17> Section 6: A password can be used in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. For security reasons it is advisable to protect the Remote Assistance invitation file using a password.

In Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, when a password is used, it is encrypted using PROV_RSA_FULL predefined Cryptographic provider with MD5 hashing and CALG_RC4, the RC4 stream encryption algorithm. More details are in the Cryptography Reference [[MSDN-CRYPTO]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89984).

The password is translated into a [**Unicode string**](#gt_unicode-string) before it is hashed. The **passStub** is a 14 character Unicode string. Also, the **passStub** is prefixed with a four-byte integer that contains the number of bytes in the following data string, as defined in BSTR data type ([MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.2.5), when performing the encryption.

<18> Section 6: This diagram applies to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 implementations only.

<19> Section 6: This type is specific to Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012.

The cipher mode used can be CRYPT_MODE_CBC and the password used during the encryption process is a Unicode string.

<21> Section 6: This attribute can be present for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 compatibility.

<22> Section 6: This diagram applies to the following Windows implementations: Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012.
