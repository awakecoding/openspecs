# 1 Introduction

The DCOM Interfaces for Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Virtual Smart Card Management Protocol is used to manage [**virtual smart cards (VSCs)**](#gt_virtual-smart-card-vsc) on a remote machine, such as those based on trusted platform modules (TPM). It provides methods for a protocol client to request creation and destruction of VSCs and to monitor the status of these operations.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_certification-authority-ca"></a>
**certification authority (CA)**: A third party that issues public key certificates. Certificates serve to bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide whether to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust is to be transitive. For more information, see [[RFC3280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90414).

<a id="gt_virtual-smart-card-vsc"></a>
**virtual smart card (VSC)**: A combination of hardware, software and firmware that implements the same interface as a smart card but is not necessarily restricted to the same physical form factors. For example, virtual smart cards may be implemented entirely in software, or they may use the cryptographic capabilities of specific hardware such as a TPM.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The DCOM Interfaces for the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Virtual Smart Card Management Protocol provides a Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) Remote Protocol [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md) interface used for creating and destroying [**VSCs**](#gt_virtual-smart-card-vsc). Like all other DCOM interfaces, this protocol uses RPC [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824), with the extensions specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md), as its underlying protocol. A VSC is a device that presents a device interface complying with the PC/SC specification for PC-connected interface devices [[PCSC3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90244) to its host operating system (OS) platform. This protocol does not assume anything about the underlying implementation of VSC devices. In particular, while it is primarily intended for the management of VSCs based on TPMs, it can also be used to manage other types of VSCs. The protocol defines two interfaces: a primary interface which is used to request VSC operations on a target system, and a secondary interface which is used by that target system to return status and progress information to the requestor.

In a typical scenario, this protocol is used by a requestor (generally an administrative workstation) to manage VSC devices on a target (generally an end-user workstation). The requestor, acting as a client, connects to the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager, ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2, or ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager3 interface on the target (which acts as the server) and requests the target to either create or destroy a VSC by passing appropriate parameters. These parameters include a reference to an ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback DCOM interface on the requestor that can be used to provide status updates through callbacks.

The principal difference between the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2 interface and the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager3 interface is that the latter supports creation of attestation-capable virtual smart cards.

The principal difference between the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager interface and the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2 interface is that the latter supports policies to define valid values for the smart-card PIN.

The target, after validating these parameters, starts executing the requested operation. It also opens a second connection back to the requestor over which it invokes the requestor’s ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback interface as a client, and calls the appropriate functions of that interface to provide progress or error codes. When the operation is completed, the target closes this second connection and returns the result for the requestor’s original method invocation.

This entire process is illustrated in Figure 1.

## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The DCOM Interfaces for the TPM Virtual Smart Card Management Protocol relies on the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) Remote Protocol, as specified in [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md), which uses RPC [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) as its transport. A diagram of these relationships is shown in the following figure:

![Protocol Relationships](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: Protocol Relationships

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

This protocol is implemented over DCOM and RPC. Therefore, it has the prerequisites specified in [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md) and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) as being common to protocols that depend on DCOM and RPC respectively.

This protocol also requires a compliant implementation of [[PCSC3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90244), as well as any additional host OS facilities required to support the creation of [**VSCs**](#gt_virtual-smart-card-vsc), on the target.

This protocol requires the use of a secure RPC connection. The requestor is required to possess the credentials of an administrative user on the target, and both requestor and target are required to support security packages that implement support for impersonation as well as packet privacy and integrity.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is applicable to scenarios where it is desirable to remotely manage VSC devices on a computer with a smart card implementation compliant with [[PCSC3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90244).

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

- **Supported Transports:** This protocol uses the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) Remote Protocol [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md), which in turn uses RPC over TCP as its only transport, as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).
- **Protocol Versions:** This protocol includes two DCOM interfaces (namely ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager and ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback), both of which are version 0.0 as defined in section [2.2](#Section_2.2).
- **Security and Authentication Methods:** Microsoft RPC, as defined in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md), is used to negotiate the authentication mechanism, as specified in [MS-SPNG](../MS-SPNG/MS-SPNG.md) and in section [3.1](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).
- **Localization:** This protocol uses predefined status codes and error codes. It is the caller’s responsibility to localize the status and error codes to localized strings.
- **Capability Negotiation:** This protocol does not support explicit capability negotiation. However, as specified in section [3.1.4](#Section_3.4), the requestor can disable the use of the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback interface by providing a NULL callback parameter. Even if a callback parameter is provided by the requestor, the target can choose to not use the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback interface.
<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor Extensible Fields

This protocol uses HRESULT values as defined in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.1. Vendors can define their own HRESULT values, provided they set the C bit (0x20000000) for each vendor-defined value, indicating the value is a customer code.

## 2.1 Transport

This protocol uses RPC dynamic endpoints as defined in Part 4 of [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824).

The client and server MUST communicate by using the DCOM Remote Protocol [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md). DCOM, in turn, uses RPC with the ncacn_ip_tcp (RPC over TCP) protocol sequence, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

The server MUST use the RPC security extensions specified in [MS-RPCE] in the manner specified in section [3.1.3](#Section_3.4) and section [3.1.4](#Section_3.4). It MUST support the use of Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO) [MS-SPNG](../MS-SPNG/MS-SPNG.md) [[RFC4178]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90461) to negotiate security providers, and it MUST register one or more security packages that can be negotiated using this protocol.

A server RPC interface implementing one of the DCOM interfaces specified by this protocol MUST use the appropriate UUID as specified in section [1.9](#Section_1.9).

The RPC version number for all interfaces MUST be 0.0.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Common Data Types

This protocol MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to support both the NDR and NDR64 transfer syntaxes and provide a negotiation mechanism for determining which transfer syntax will be used, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.

In addition to the RPC base types and definitions specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-RPCE], additional data types are defined in this section.

The following data types are specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md):

# 3 Protocol Details

Implementations of this protocol MUST implement support for ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager and ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback. They SHOULD<3> implement support for ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2 and ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager3.

The client side of the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager, ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2, and ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager3 interfaces is simply a pass-through. That is, no additional timers or other state is required on the client side of these interfaces. Calls made by the higher-layer protocol or application are passed directly to the transport, and the results returned by the transport are passed directly back to the higher-layer protocol or application. The set of in-progress calls is made available to the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback server as specified in section [3.2.1](#Section_3.2).

Similarly, the client side of the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback interface is also a pass-through and requires no additional timers or other state. This protocol is only intended to be invoked by the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager, ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2, or ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager3 server while processing a call to one of its methods. When invoked in this way, the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback client simply passes the call directly to the underlying DCOM transport, using the same causality ID as the triggering ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager, ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2, or ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager3 call as specified in [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md) section 3.2.4.2.

## 3.1 ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager Server Details

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This protocol maintains no state. However, as specified in section [1.5](#Section_1.5), it assumes that the server has access to a smart card implementation compliant with [[PCSC3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90244) and associated facilities for creating [**VSCs**](#gt_virtual-smart-card-vsc). Those components are able to maintain implementation-specific state.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The server MUST register itself with the DCOM infrastructure and bind to a dynamic endpoint obtained from the RPC runtime.

The server MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to negotiate security contexts by using the SPNEGO protocol ([[RFC4178]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90461)). The server SHOULD request the RPC runtime to reject any unauthenticated connections.

The server MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to perform a strict NDR data consistency check at target level 6.0, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.

The server MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to reject a NULL unique or full pointer with non-zero conformant value, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 3.

The server MUST confirm the presence of an underlying smart card infrastructure complying with [[PCSC3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90244). If no such infrastructure is present, the server MUST stop initialization and exit with an error.

#### 3.1.4.1 CreateVirtualSmartCard (Opnum 3)

This method is invoked by the requestor to create a [**VSC**](#gt_virtual-smart-card-vsc) on the target.

HRESULT CreateVirtualSmartCard(

[in, string] const wchar_t* pszFriendlyName,

[in] unsigned char bAdminAlgId,

[in, size_is(cbAdminKey)] const unsigned char* pbAdminKey,

[in] unsigned long cbAdminKey,

[in, size_is(cbPin)] const unsigned char* pbPin,

[in] unsigned long cbPin,

[in] int fGenerate,

[in, unique] ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback* pStatusCallback,

[out, string] wchar_t** ppszInstanceId,

[out] int* pfNeedReboot);

**pszFriendlyName:** A Unicode string for use in any user interface messages relating to this VSC.

**bAdminAlgId:** An unsigned byte value. This parameter MUST be set to 0x82.

**pbAdminKey:** An array of 24 bytes containing a TDEA [[SP800-67]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131225) key intended to be used as the administrative key for the new VSC.

**cbAdminKey:** A 32-bit unsigned integer value. It MUST be set to 24.

**pbAdminKcv:** An array of bytes containing the Key Check Value (KCV) for the administrative key contained in the pbAdminKey parameter. This parameter is optional and MUST be set to NULL if absent. If present, it MUST be computed by encrypting eight zero bytes using the TDEA [SP800-67] block cipher and taking the first three bytes.

**cbAdminKcv:** A 32-bit unsigned integer value. It MUST be set to 0 if the pbAdmin parameter is NULL, and MUST be set to 3 otherwise.

**pbPuk:** An array of bytes containing the desired PUK for the new VSC. This parameter is optional and MUST be set to NULL if absent. If present, its length MUST be between 8 and 127 bytes, inclusive.

**cbPuk:** A 32-bit unsigned integer value. It MUST be equal to the length of the pbPuk parameter in bytes. If pbPuk is NULL, this parameter MUST be set to 0.

**pbPin:** An array of bytes containing the desired PIN for the new VSC. Its length MUST be between 8 and 127 bytes, inclusive.

**cbPin:** A 32-bit unsigned integer value. It MUST be equal to the length of the pbPin parameter in bytes.

**pfNeedReboot:** A Boolean value that indicates whether or not a reboot is required on the server before the newly-created VSC is made available to applications.

**Return Values:** The server MUST return 0 if it successfully creates the new VSC, and a nonzero value otherwise.

**Exceptions Thrown:** No exceptions are thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

The server MUST validate the parameters before executing the requested operation and fail requests with invalid parameters.

If pbAdminKcv is present, the server MUST perform admin key integrity check. The admin key integrity check is done by encrypting eight zero bytes using the TDEA [SP800-67] block cipher, taking the first 3 bytes and verifying that it matches the provided pbAdminKcv value. If the computed bytes do not match the provided pbAdminKcv value, the admin key integrity check fails and the server MUST fail the requested operation.

If pbPuk is present, the server MUST create a VSC that supports PUK-based PIN reset and its PUK is set as the provided pbPuk value. Otherwise, the server MUST create a VSC that supports challenge-response-based PIN reset through the admin role.

Upon successful creation of a VSC, the server MUST initialize all data structures necessary for the VSC, and register it with the underlying smart card implementation compliant with [[PCSC3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90244). The server MUST allocate an instance identifier to the newly-created VSC that is unique among all such identifiers in use at that time.

If pStatusCallback is present, the server SHOULD notify the client of the progress and errors of the undergoing operation, as specified in section [3.2.4](#Section_3.2). The status callback happens synchronously with the requested operation. If the status callback returns an error code, the server MUST abort the VSC creation and return a non-zero error to the client, with the severity bit in the error code set to 1. In this case, the server SHOULD also roll back all changes made in respect to the requested operation.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.2"></a>
#### 3.1.4.2 DestroyVirtualSmartCard (Opnum 4)

This method is invoked by the requestor to destroy a previously-created [**VSC**](#gt_virtual-smart-card-vsc) on the target.

HRESULT DestroyVirtualSmartCard(

[in, string] const wchar_t* pszInstanceId,

[in, unique] ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback* pStatusCallback,

[out] int* pfNeedReboot);

**pszInstanceId:** A Unicode string containing the instance identifier for the VSC to be destroyed.

**pStatusCallback:** A reference to an instance of the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback DCOM interface on the requestor. The server uses this interface to provide feedback on progress and errors. This parameter is optional and MUST be set to NULL if absent.

**pfNeedReboot:** A Boolean value that indicates whether or not a reboot is required on the server to complete the destruction of the VSC.

**Return Values:** The server MUST return 0 if it successfully locates and destroys the indicated VSC, and a nonzero value otherwise.

**Exceptions Thrown:** No exceptions are thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

The server MUST validate the parameters before executing the requested operation and fail requests with invalid parameters.

In response to the request, the server MUST locate the VSC using the provided instance identifier from the underlying smart card implementation compliant with [[PCSC3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90244), remove its registration with the implementation, and clear all data structures associated with the VSC.

If pStatusCallback is present, the server SHOULD notify the client of the progress and errors of the undergoing operation, as specified in section [3.2.4](#Section_3.2). The status callback happens synchronously with the requested operation. If the status callback returns an error code, the server SHOULD try to abort the requested operation and roll back all changes related to the operation. If the operation is aborted, the server MUST return a non-zero error code to the client, with the severity bit in the error code set to 1. If the operation cannot be aborted, the server MUST ignore the error from the status callback interface and complete the requested operation.

Since the status callback interface is optional when creating a VSC, the requestor cannot provide a callback interface to the target. In this case, the requestor is only notified through the return value when the requested operation has been completed on the target.

The following figure shows the communication between the requestor and the target when creating a VSC without a requestor-provided callback interface.

## 4.2 Create a VSC with Status Callback

When creating a VSC on the target, the requestor can provide a callback interface to receive progress and error notifications from the target while the requested operation is being executed on the target.

The following figure shows the communications between the requestor and the target when creating a VSC with a requestor-provided callback interface.

In this example, the requestor returns zero for each call to ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback::ReportProgress. For brevity, these returns are omitted from the diagram.

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

This protocol uses DCOM as its underlying transport. Therefore, all security considerations that apply to DCOM interfaces, as specified in [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md) section 5, are also applicable to this protocol.

The ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager interface allows the requestor to alter system state on the target computer in a persistent way. Therefore, as specified in section [3.1.4](#Section_3.4), any server implementation of this interface has to ensure that the requestor has appropriate administrative privileges.

In addition, some of the parameters to the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager methods, in particular the PIN, PUK, and administrative keys, contain sensitive information. It is recommended that the client and server take reasonable measures to protect these parameter values, including not writing them to persistent storage and erasing them from memory immediately after use.

The underlying [**VSC**](#gt_virtual-smart-card-vsc) implementation is required to implement appropriate security measures as well. In particular, any keys it generates need to be cryptographically random and not written to unsecured storage in the clear. When a VSC is destroyed, its contents are also destroyed to prevent possible future recovery of its key material.

Sharing AIKs between VSCs allows linking of those VSCs by anyone who sees attestation statements from both VSCs. This can be a privacy issue in some cases. Client implementations can avoid privacy issues by not sharing AIKs and AIK certificates between VSCs.

The security of the attestation relies on the security properties of the TPM itself. Any weaknesses in the TPM implementation will correspondingly affect the strength of the assurance provided by the attestation statement. Implementers are advised to take this into account when deciding whether to implement this protocol on a particular platform.

The security assurance of attestation statements issued by the VSC depends on how strongly the AIK is believed to be associated with a secure TPM. When deploying this protocol, it is important to ensure the integrity of the process for issuing AIK certificates (or for determining the AIKs associated with a given platform, if certificates are not used). In addition, it is important to ensure the security of the PKI that issues the AIK certificates and to follow good certificate management practices.
