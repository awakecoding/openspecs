# 1 Introduction

The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): WebAuthn Virtual Channel Protocol provides a way for a user to do WebAuthn operations over the RDP protocol. It enables a server to send webauthn request to a client, the client can then use this request to talk to authenticators (platform as well as cross-platform) and reply with the response.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_remote-desktop-protocol-rdp"></a>
**Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**: A multi-channel protocol that allows a user to connect to a computer running Microsoft Terminal Services (TS). RDP enables the exchange of client and server settings and also enables negotiation of common settings to use for the duration of the connection, so that input, graphics, and other data can be exchanged and processed between client and server.

<a id="gt_transmission-control-protocol-tcp"></a>
**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: A protocol used with the Internet Protocol (IP) to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. TCP handles keeping track of the individual units of data (called packets) that a message is divided into for efficient routing through the Internet.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.2"></a>
## 1.2 References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the [Errata](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=850906).

## 1.3 Overview

The Remote Desktop Protocol: WebAuthn Virtual Channel provides a way for a user to do WebAuthn operations over the RDP protocol.

More details about WebAuthn can be found in [[W3C-WebAuthPKC2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197149).

The WebAuthn javascript API is handled by the browser. The browser in turn calls the system-provided APIs on Windows. The system then establishes a virtual channel to the RDP client and sends the request to it. On the RDP client side, the request is decoded and processed by talking to available authenticators via the Client-to-Authenticator protocol (CTAP) protocol. See [[FIDO-CTAP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197651) for more details about the CTAP protocol.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol uses the [[W3C-WebAuthPKC2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197149) and [[FIDO-CTAP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197651) protocols.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Remote Desktop Protocol: WebAuthn Virtual Channel operates only after the dynamic virtual channel transport is fully established.

This protocol is message-based. It assumes preservation of the packet as a whole and does not allow for fragmentation. Additionally, it assumes that no packets are lost.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is designed to be run within the context of a [**Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**](#gt_remote-desktop-protocol-rdp) virtual channel established between a client and a server.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This protocol supports versioning and capability negotiation as part of the request. A client that supports this protocol does allow this virtual channel to be opened, and a client that does not support this protocol does not allow this virtual channel to be opened.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol also uses Win32 error codes. These values are taken from the error number space as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.2. Vendors SHOULD reuse those values with their indicated meanings. Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the future.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

None.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The protocol uses a channel named WebAuthN_Channel. This channel MUST be implemented using a reliable protocol, such as [**TCP**](#gt_transmission-control-protocol-tcp). Messages written to this channel are assumed to be complete and to arrive in order.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

Requests and responses are encoded in Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) format. For more details about CBOR, see [[IETF-8949]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197446). CBOR encoding is used because it is used in the CTAP protocol ([[FIDO-CTAP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197651)) to access security keys. Hence clients needing to use external security keys need to use CBOR encoding. Platform authenticators provide their own APIs to talk to use their implementations. Overall, the WebAuthn request from the relying party is encoded along with metadata about the operation in the request message.

This protocol has two messages, a request message and a response message. The two messages perform different operations depending on their content. Each message is a CBOR map (see [IETF-8949], section 3.1, “Major Types,” for a description of a map). The messages themselves, depending on the type of request or response, will in turn contain additional maps.

The next two sections describe the request and response messages and their elements.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 WebAuthN_Channel Request Message

The WebAuthN_Channel request message is a CBOR map using the following keys and values.

# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Client and Server Details

The protocol has two main operations: MakeCredential (section [2.2.1.2](#Section_2.2.1.2)) and GetAssertion (section [2.2.1.3](#Section_2.2.1.3)). The MakeCredential operation registers a credential on the authenticator for the replying party. The GetAssertion operation authentices the user to the relying party using the authenticator.

This protocol is designed to be closer to the WebAuthn layer rather than the CTAP layer. Individual fields in the request map to the WebAuthn options defined at the WebAuthn layer.

Once a request is received by the client, the client determines which authenticator can satisfy the request. The process of determining which authenticator supports particular capabilities and whether it can satisfy a request are defined in the CTAP specification. See [[FIDO-CTAP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197651), sections 4 and 5.4.
