# 1 Introduction

An industry trend has been developing in which employees connect their personal mobile computing devices to the corporate network and resources (either on premise or through the cloud) to perform workplace tasks. This trend requires support for easy configuration of the network and resources, such that employees can register personal devices with the company for work-related purposes. Applications and technology to support easy configuration also enable IT professionals to manage the risk associated with having uncontrolled devices connected to the corporate network.

The Mobile Device Management Protocol (MDM) [MS-MDM](../MS-MDM/MS-MDM.md) specifies a protocol for managing devices through a [**Device Management Service (DMS)**](#gt_device-management-service-dms). This document describes the Mobile Device Enrollment Protocol (MDE), which enables enrolling a device with the [**DMS**](#gt_digital-media-server-dms) through an [**Enrollment Service (ES)**](#gt_enrollment-service-es). The protocol includes the discovery of the [**Management Enrollment Service (MES)**](#gt_management-enrollment-service-mes) and enrollment with the ES.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_base64-encoding"></a>
**base64 encoding**: A binary-to-text encoding scheme whereby an arbitrary sequence of bytes is converted to a sequence of printable ASCII characters, as described in [[RFC4648]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90487).

<a id="gt_certificate"></a>
**certificate**: A certificate is a collection of attributes and extensions that can be stored persistently. The set of attributes in a certificate can vary depending on the intended usage of the certificate. A certificate securely binds a public key to the entity that holds the corresponding private key. A certificate is commonly used for authentication and secure exchange of information on open networks, such as the Internet, extranets, and intranets. Certificates are digitally signed by the issuing [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) and can be issued for a user, a computer, or a service. The most widely accepted format for certificates is defined by the ITU-T X.509 version 3 international standards. For more information about attributes and extensions, see [[RFC3280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90414) and [[X509]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90590) sections 7 and 8.

<a id="gt_certification-authority-ca"></a>
**certification authority (CA)**: A third party that issues public key [**certificates**](#gt_certificate). Certificates serve to bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide whether to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust is to be transitive. For more information, see [RFC3280].

<a id="gt_device-management-client"></a>
**device management client**: An application or agent running on a device that implements the Mobile Device Management Protocol [MS-MDM].

<a id="gt_uniform-resource-locator-url"></a>
**Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**: A string of characters in a standardized format that identifies a document or resource on the World Wide Web. The format is as specified in [[RFC1738]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90287).

<a id="gt_url-scheme"></a>
**URL scheme**: The top level of an URL naming structure. All URL references are formed with a scheme name, followed by a colon character ":". For example, in the URL http://contoso.com, the URL scheme name is http.

<a id="gt_user-principal-name-upn"></a>
**user principal name (UPN)**: A user account name (sometimes referred to as the user logon name) and a domain name that identifies the domain in which the user account is located. This is the standard usage for logging on to a Windows domain. The format is: someone@example.com (in the form of an email address). In Active Directory, the userPrincipalName attribute of the account object, as described in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

<a id="gt_web-service"></a>

Web services can perform functions that range from simple requests to complicated business processes.

<a id="gt_web-services-description-language-wsdl"></a>
**Web Services Description Language (WSDL)**: An XML format for describing network services as a set of endpoints that operate on messages that contain either document-oriented or procedure-oriented information. The operations and messages are described abstractly and are bound to a concrete network protocol and message format in order to define an endpoint. Related concrete endpoints are combined into abstract endpoints, which describe a network service. WSDL is extensible, which allows the description of endpoints and their messages regardless of the message formats or network protocols that are used.

<a id="gt_x509"></a>

**XML namespace**: A collection of names that is used to identify elements, types, and attributes in XML documents identified in a URI reference [[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453). A combination of XML namespace and local name allows XML documents to use elements, types, and attributes that have the same names but come from different sources. For more information, see [[XMLNS-2ED]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90602).

<a id="gt_xml-path-language-xpath"></a>
**XML Path Language (XPath)**: A language used to create expressions that can address parts of an XML document, manipulate strings, numbers, and Booleans, and can match a set of nodes in the document, as specified in [XPATH]. XPath models an XML document as a tree of nodes of different types, including element, attribute, and text. XPath expressions can identify the nodes in an XML document based on their type, name, and values, as well as the relationship of a node to other nodes in the document.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

MDE enables a device to be enrolled with the [**Device Management Service (DMS)**](#gt_device-management-service-dms) through an [**Enrollment Service (ES)**](#gt_enrollment-service-es), including the discovery of the [**Management Enrollment Service (MES)**](#gt_management-enrollment-service-mes) and enrollment with the ES. After a device is enrolled, the device can be managed with the [**DMS**](#gt_digital-media-server-dms) using MDM.

The process for enrolling a device using MDE is shown in the following diagram.

![Typical sequence for enrolling a message using MDE](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Typical sequence for enrolling a message using MDE

The enrollment process consists of the following steps.

- The user’s email name is entered via the [**enrollment client**](#gt_enrollment-client).
- The enrollment client extracts the domain suffix from the email address, prepends the domain name with a well-known label, and resolves the address to the [**Discovery Service (DS)**](#gt_discovery-service-ds). The administrator configures the network name resolution service (that is, the [**Domain Name System (DNS)**](#gt_domain-name-system-dns)) appropriately.
- The enrollment client sends an [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http) GET request to the Discovery Service (DS) to validate the existence of the [**service endpoint**](#gt_service-endpoint).
- The enrollment client sends a **Discover** message (section [3.1.4.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.4.1.1.1)) to the Discovery Service (DS). The Discovery Service (DS) responds with a **DiscoverResponse** message (section [3.1.4.1.1.2](#Section_3.1.4.1.1.2)) containing the Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) of service endpoints required for the following steps.
- The enrollment client communicates with the [**security token service (STS)**](#gt_security-token-service-sts) (section [3.2](#Section_3.2)) to obtain a [**security token**](#gt_security-token) to authenticate with the ES.
- The enrollment client sends a **GetPolicies** message (section [3.3.4.1.1.1](#Section_3.3.4.1.1.1)) the [**ES endpoint**](#gt_es-endpoint) [MS-XCEP](../MS-XCEP/MS-XCEP.md) using the security token received in the previous step. The ES endpoint [MS-XCEP] responds with a **GetPoliciesResponse** message (section [3.3.4.1.1.2](#Section_3.3.4.1.1.2)) containing the [**certificate policies**](#gt_certificate-policy) required for the next step. For more information about these messages, see [MS-XCEP] sections 3.1.4.1.1.1 and 3.1.4.1.1.2.
- **Part a.** The enrollment client can send a **RequestSecurityToken** message (section [3.4.4.1.1.1](#Section_3.4.4.1.1.1)) to the ES endpoint [MS-WSTEP](../MS-WSTEP/MS-WSTEP.md) using the security token received in step 4. The ES endpoint [MS-WSTEP] responds with a **RequestSecurityTokenResponseCollection** message (section [3.4.4.1.1.3](#Section_3.4.4.1.1.3)) containing the identity and [**provisioning information**](#gt_provisioning-information) for the [**device management client**](#gt_device-management-client) [MS-MDM](../MS-MDM/MS-MDM.md). For more information about these messages, see [MS-WSTEP] sections 3.1.4.1.1.1 and 3.1.4.1.1.2.
**Part b.** The enrollment client can send a **RequestSecurityTokenOnBehalfOf** message (section 3.4.4.1.1.3) to the ES endpoint [MS-WSTEP] using the security token received in step 4. The ES endpoint [MS-WSTEP] responds with a **RequestSecurityTokenResponseCollection** message (section 3.4.4.1.1.3) containing the identity and provisioning information for the device management client [MS-MDM]. For more information about these messages, see [MS-WSTEP] sections 3.1.4.1.1.1 and 3.1.4.1.1.2.

The steps for MDE device enrollment correspond to five phases as shown in the following diagram.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

MDE depends on the WS-Trust X.509v3 Token Enrollment Extensions [MS-WSTEP](../MS-WSTEP/MS-WSTEP.md).

MDE depends on the X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy Protocol [MS-XCEP](../MS-XCEP/MS-XCEP.md).

The Mobile Device Management Protocol (MDM) depends on MDE. A device has to be enrolled in an [**MES**](#gt_management-enrollment-service-mes) through the use of MDE before the device can be managed using MDM [MS-MDM](../MS-MDM/MS-MDM.md).

![Relationship to other protocols](media/image3.png)

Figure 3: Relationship to other protocols

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

MDE issues X.509v3 [MS-WSTEP](../MS-WSTEP/MS-WSTEP.md) certificates and [**provisioning information**](#gt_provisioning-information) for [**device management clients**](#gt_device-management-client) [MS-MDM](../MS-MDM/MS-MDM.md) to enable a relationship between the user and a device in the [**DMS**](#gt_digital-media-server-dms).

The [**MES**](#gt_management-enrollment-service-mes) issues a [**security token**](#gt_security-token) (after appropriate authentication) that is used to authenticate to the [**ES**](#gt_enrollment-service-es).

The ES communicates with a [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) to issue an [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificate**](#gt_certificate).

The ES issues provisioning information for a device management client [MS-MDM]. The ES has to be configured with this information or be able to retrieve it from the DMS.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

A device has to be enrolled in an [**MES**](#gt_management-enrollment-service-mes) through the use of MDE before the device can be managed using MDM [MS-MDM](../MS-MDM/MS-MDM.md).

## 3.1 IDiscoveryService Server Details

This section describes the first and second phases in MDE device enrollment: resolving the [**Discovery Service (DS)**](#gt_discovery-service-ds) and discovering the [**ES**](#gt_enrollment-service-es). The following diagram highlights these two phases.

![MDE device enrollment: resolving the DS and discovering the ES](media/image4.png)

Figure 4: MDE device enrollment: resolving the DS and discovering the ES

The **IDiscoveryService** DS in MDE hosts an endpoint to receive messages from the [**enrollment client**](#gt_enrollment-client). When a **Discover** request message (section [3.1.4.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.4.1.1.1)) is received from the client, the server processes the request and returns a **DiscoverResponse** message (section [3.1.4.1.1.2](#Section_3.1.4.1.1.2)) to the client. The response identifies the endpoints to be used by the client to obtain the security tokens and enroll via the ES. After the response message is sent to the client, the server returns to the waiting state.

The following diagram shows the role of the server in resolving the Discovery Service (DS) for the enrollment client:

![Role of server in resolving the DS](media/image5.png)

Figure 5: Role of server in resolving the DS

As a prerequisite for enabling the enrollment client to discover the Discovery Service (DS), the administrator MUST configure the [**DNS**](#gt_domain-name-system-dns), such that the name "EnterpriseEnrollment.*[User's Domain]*" resolves to the Discovery Service (DS). The enrollment client extracts the domain suffix from the email address of the enrolling user and prepends it with the DNS to construct the address for the **DS**. For example, if the email address for the user is "user1@contoso.com", the enrollment client extracts the domain suffix "contoso.com" and prepends it with the DNS to construct the **DS** address "EnterpriseEnrollment.*contoso.com*".

In the example, the full URL sent by the client to the **DS** is "https://EnterpriseEnrollment.contoso.com/EnrollmentServer/Discovery.svc".

The path portion of the URL "/EnrollmentServer/Discovery.svc" is always constant.

The enrollment client validates the [**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**](#gt_secure-sockets-layer-ssl) [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) that is protecting the **DS** endpoint, along with any intermediary certificates that are signed by a trusted [**CA**](#gt_certification-authority-ca).

## 3.2 Interaction with Security Token Service (STS)

This section describes the third phase in MDE device enrollment: requesting and receiving the [**security token**](#gt_security-token). The following diagram highlights this phase.

![MDE device enrollment: requesting and receiving the security token](media/image6.png)

Figure 6: MDE device enrollment: requesting and receiving the security token

After the [**enrollment client**](#gt_enrollment-client) receives the **DiscoverResponse** message (section [3.1.4.1.1.2](#Section_3.1.4.1.1.2)), the client obtains a security token from the [**STS**](#gt_security-token-service-sts) specified in the value for the <DiscoveryResponse><AuthenticationServiceUrl> element (section [3.1.4.1.3.2](#Section_3.1.4.1.3.2)).

**Note** The enrollment client is agnostic with regards to the protocol flows for authenticating and returning the security token. While the STS might prompt for user credentials directly or enter into a federation protocol with an STS and directory service, MDE is agnostic to all of this. To remain agnostic, all protocol flows pertaining to authentication that involve the enrollment client are passive, that is, browser-implemented.

The following are the explicit requirements for the STS:

The <DiscoveryResponse><AuthenticationServiceUrl> element (section 3.1.4.1.3.2) MUST support HTTPS.

The enrollment client issues an HTTPS request as follows:

AuthenticationServiceUrl?appru=<appid>&login_hint=<User Principal Name>

`<appid>` is of the form `ms-app://string`

`<User Principal Name>` is the name of the enrolling user, for example, `user@constoso.com`. The value of this attribute serves as a hint that can be used by the STS as part of the authentication.

After authentication is complete, the STS SHOULD return an [**HTML form**](#gt_html-form) document with a POST method action of `appid` identified in the [**query string**](#gt_query-string) parameter. For example:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

Vary: Accept-Encoding

Content-Length: 556

<!DOCTYPE>

<html>

<head>

<title>Working...</title>

<script>

function formSubmit() {

document.forms[0].submit();

}

window.onload=formSubmit;

</script>

</head>

<body>

<form method="post" action="ms-app://windows.immersivecontrolpanel">

<input type="hidden" name="wresult" value="token value"/>

<input type="submit"/>

</form>

</body>

</html>

The STS has to send a POST to a redirect [**URL**](#gt_uniform-resource-locator-url) of the form `ms-app://string` (the [**URL scheme**](#gt_url-scheme) is `ms-app`) as indicated in the POST method action. The security token value is the [**base64**](#gt_179b9392-9019-45a3-880b-26f6890522b7)-encoded string `"http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd#base64binary"` contained in the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> EncodingType attribute (section [3.3](#Section_3.3)).

Sequentially, the string is HTML encoded before it is base64 encoded, so that when it is unencoded from base64 it can be returned embedded in HTML.

This string is opaque to the enrollment client; the client does not interpret the string.

<a id="Section_3.3"></a>
## 3.3 Interaction with X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy

This section describes the fourth phase in MDE device enrollment: interacting with the X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy Protocol [MS-XCEP](../MS-XCEP/MS-XCEP.md) to obtain the [**certificate policies**](#gt_certificate-policy). The following diagram highlights this phase.

![MDE device enrollment: getting the certificate policies](media/image7.png)

Figure 7: MDE device enrollment: getting the certificate policies

The X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy Protocol [MS-XCEP] enables a client to request [**certificate enrollment policies**](#gt_b8b89448-1696-4337-aeb3-7f6fbf117915) from a server. The communication is initiated by the [**enrollment client**](#gt_enrollment-client) request to the server for the certificate enrollment policies. The server authenticates the client, validates the request, and returns a response with a collection of certificate enrollment policy objects. As described in section [3.2](../MS-XCEP/MS-XCEP.md), the enrollment client uses the certificate enrollment policies to complete the enrollment process [MS-WSTEP](../MS-WSTEP/MS-WSTEP.md). MDE uses the policies to allow the [**ES**](#gt_enrollment-service-es) to specify the hash algorithm and key length as described in the following section.

**Authentication**

MDE implements the authentication provisions in WS-Security 2004 [[WSS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=130727) to enable the ES [MS-XCEP] to authenticate the **GetPolicies** requestor [MS-XCEP]. This section defines the schema used to express the credential descriptor for the credential type. The [**security token**](#gt_security-token) credential is provided in a request message using the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element [WSS]. The security token is retrieved as described in section 3.2. The authentication information is as follows:

**wsse:Security:** MDE implements the <wsse:Security> element defined in [WSS] section 5. The <wsse:Security> element MUST be a child of the <s:Header> element (see [MS-XCEP] section 4).

**wsse:BinarySecurityToken:** MDE implements the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element defined in [WSS] section 6.3. The <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element MUST be included as a child of the <wsse:Security> element in the [**SOAP header**](#gt_soap-header).

- As was described in section 3.2, inclusion of the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element is opaque to the enrollment client and the client does not interpret the string and inclusion of the element is agreed upon by the [**STS**](#gt_security-token-service-sts) (as identified in the **DS** <AuthenticationServiceUrl> element of <DiscoveryResponse> (section [3.1.4.1.3.2](#Section_3.1.4.1.3.2))) and the ES.
- The <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element contains a [**base64**](#gt_179b9392-9019-45a3-880b-26f6890522b7)-encoded string. The enrollment client uses the security token received from the STS and base64-encodes the token to populate the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element.
**wsse:BinarySecurityToken/attributes/ValueType:** The <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> ValueType attribute MUST be `"http://schemas.microsoft.com/5.0.0.0/ConfigurationManager/Enrollment/DeviceEnrollmentUserToken".`

**wsse:BinarySecurityToken/attributes/EncodingType:** The <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> EncodingType attribute MUST be `"http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd#base64binary".`

## 3.4 Interaction with WS-Trust X.509v3 Token Enrollment

This section describes the fifth phase in MDE device enrollment: interacting with the WS-Trust X.509v3 Token Enrollment Extensions [MS-WSTEP](../MS-WSTEP/MS-WSTEP.md) to complete enrollment. The following diagram highlights this final phase.

![MDE device enrollment: completing enrollment](media/image8.png)

Figure 8: MDE device enrollment: completing enrollment

The WS-Trust X509v3 Enrollment Extensions [MS-WSTEP] are extensions of WS-Trust Security 2004 [[WSS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=130727) that are used by a system to request that a [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) be issued. MDE implements an extension profile of the extensions defined in [MS-WSTEP], to enable a device to be enrolled and receive an identity. The following sections specify the details of the MDE profile of and extensions defined in [MS-WSTEP].

**Authentication**

The WS-Trust X509v3 Enrollment Extensions [MS-WSTEP] use the authentication provisions in WS-Security 2004 [WSS] to enable the X509v3 [**security token**](#gt_security-token) issuer to authenticate the X509v3 security token requestor. This section defines the schema used to express the credential descriptor for each supported credential type. The security token credential is provided in a request message using the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element [WSS]. The security token is retrieved as described in section [3.2](../MS-WSTEP/MS-WSTEP.md). The authentication information is as follows:

**wsse:Security:** MDE implements the <wsse:Security> element defined in [WSS] section 5. The <wsse:Security> element MUST be a child of the <s:Header> element (see [MS-XCEP](../MS-XCEP/MS-XCEP.md) section 4).

**wsse:BinarySecurityToken:** MDE implements the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element defined in [WSS] section 6.3. The <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element MUST be included as a child of the <wsse:Security> element in the [**SOAP header**](#gt_soap-header).

- As was described in section 3.2, inclusion of the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element is opaque to the [**enrollment client**](#gt_enrollment-client) and is agreed upon by the [**STS**](#gt_security-token-service-sts) (as identified in the **DS** <AuthenticationServiceUrl> element of <DiscoveryResponse> (section [3.1.4.1.3.2](#Section_3.1.4.1.3.2))) and the [**ES**](#gt_enrollment-service-es).
- The <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element contains a [**base64**](#gt_179b9392-9019-45a3-880b-26f6890522b7)-encoded security token. The enrollment client uses the security token received from the STS to populate the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element.
**wsse:BinarySecurityToken/attributes/ValueType:** The <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> ValueType attribute MUST be `"http://schemas.microsoft.com/5.0.0.0/ConfigurationManager/Enrollment/DeviceEnrollmentUserToken".`

**wsse:BinarySecurityToken/attributes/EncodingType:** The <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> EncodingType attribute MUST be `"http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd#base64binary".`

## 3.6 XML Provisioning Document Schema

As described in section [3.4.4.1.1.3](#Section_3.4.4.1.1.3), the <RequestSecurityTokenResponseCollection><wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element contains an [**XML**](#gt_xml) provisioning document. The entire XML provisioning document is [**base64**](#gt_179b9392-9019-45a3-880b-26f6890522b7)-encoded in the **RequestSecurityTokenResponseCollection** message (section 3.4.4.1.1.3). The document contains:

- The requested client [**certificate**](#gt_certificate), the trusted [**root certificate**](#gt_root-certificate), and intermediate certificates.
- The provisioning information for the device management client.
The enrollment client installs the client certificate, as well as the trusted root certificate and intermediate certificates. The provisioning information includes content such as the location of the DMS and various properties that the device management client uses to communicate with the DMS.

The following schema is an example of the XML required for the provisioning document<4>. The explanation for each field in the document appears inline in the example as XML comments.

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

MDE does not provide message-level signing or message-level encryption for any messages. Implementers can make use of transport protection as available in HTTPS to provide security to the client/server interaction.

MDE does not define a mechanism to limit a client's use of server resources, such as CPU, network bandwidth, and memory.

<a id="Section_5.2"></a>
## 5.2 Index of Security Parameters

None.

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

- Windows 8.1 operating system
Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 3.4.4.1.1: The RequestSecurityTokenOnBehalfOf message is added as described in Knowledge Base Article 2909569, December 2013 GDR [[MSKB-2909569]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=389613). This General Distribution Release (GDR) applies to Windows 8.1.

<2> Section 3.4.4.1.1.2: The RequestSecurityTokenOnBehalfOf message is added as described in Knowledge Base Article 2909569, December 2013 GDR [MSKB-2909569]. This General Distribution Release (GDR) applies to Windows 8.1.

<3> Section 3.4.4.1.1.2: In Windows 8.1, use of the RequestSecurityTokenOnBehalfOf message requires configuration of the following three registry keys as a prerequisite to performing enrollment:

- MachineMDMEnrollment is set to 1.
- MachineMDMEnrollmentUserUPN is set to a value that the server can identify and associate with the locally managed user.
- MachineMDMEnrollmentUserSID is set to the SID of the local user on whose behalf the administrator is enrolling.
For example, the registry keys are defined as follows:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MDM]

"MachineMDMEnrollment"=dword:00000001

"MachineMDMEnrollmentUserUPN"="joe@contoso.com"

"MachineMDMEnrollmentUserSID"="S-1-5-21-425223123-4157917690-3751521321-1002"]
