# 1 Introduction

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Input Virtual Channel Extension applies to the Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting, as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md) sections 1 to 5. The input protocol defined in section [2.2](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md) is used to remote multitouch and pen input from a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) client to a terminal server. The multitouch and pen input is generated at the client by a physical or virtual digitizer, encoded, and then sent on the wire to the server. After this input is received and decoded by the server, it is injected into the session associated with the remote user, effectively remoting the multitouch and pen input generated at the client.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

## 1.3 Overview

An example message flow encapsulating all of the Input Messages, described in section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3), and protocol phases is presented in the following figure.

![Messages exchanged by the input protocol endpoints](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Messages exchanged by the input protocol endpoints

The input protocol is divided into two distinct phases:

- Initializing Phase
- Running Phase
The Initializing Phase occurs at the start of the connection. During this phase, the server and client exchange the [RDPINPUT_SC_READY_PDU (section 2.2.3.1)](#Section_2.2.3.1) and [RDPINPUT_CS_READY_PDU (section 2.2.3.2)](#Section_2.2.3.2) messages. The server initiates this exchange when the dynamic virtual channel (sections [1.4](#Section_1.4) and [2.1](#Section_2.1)) over which the input messages will flow has been opened.

Once both endpoints are ready, the Running Phase is entered. During this phase, the client sends touch or pen frames to the server encapsulated in the [RDPINPUT_TOUCH_EVENT_PDU (section 2.2.3.3)](#Section_2.2.3.3) or [RDPINPUT_PEN_EVENT_PDU (section 2.2.3.7)](#Section_2.2.3.7) message. The server decodes these frames and injects them into the user's session.

During the Running Phase, the server can request that the client suspend the transmission of input messages by sending the [RDPINPUT_SUSPEND_INPUT_PDU (section 2.2.3.4)](#Section_2.2.3.4) message to the client. To request that the client resume the transmission of input messages, the server can send the [RDPINPUT_RESUME_INPUT_PDU (section 2.2.3.5)](#Section_2.2.3.5) message to the client.

To transition touch contacts in the "hovering" state to the "out of range" state (section [3.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.1.1)), the client can send the [RDPINPUT_DISMISS_HOVERING_TOUCH_CONTACT_PDU (section 2.2.3.6)](#Section_2.2.3.6) message to the server. This message effectively allows individual contacts (in the hovering state) to be transitioned to the out of range state without requiring the construction and transmission of a touch frame from client to server. If the contact specified in the **RDPINPUT_DISMISS_HOVERING_TOUCH_CONTACT_PDU** message does not exist on the server, then the message is simply ignored.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Input Virtual Channel Extension is embedded in a dynamic virtual channel transport, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) sections 1 to 3.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Input Virtual Channel Extension operates only after the dynamic virtual channel transport is fully established. If the dynamic virtual channel transport is terminated, the Remote Desktop Protocol: Input Virtual Channel Extension is also terminated. The protocol is terminated by closing the underlying virtual channel. For details about closing the dynamic virtual channel, see [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) section 3.2.5.2.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Input Virtual Channel Extension is applicable in scenarios where the transfer of multitouch or pen input frames (generated by a physical or virtual digitizer) is required from a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) client to a terminal server.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

None.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

## 2.1 Transport

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Input Virtual Channel Extension is designed to operate over a dynamic virtual channel, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) sections 1 to 3. The dynamic virtual channel name is the null-terminated [**ANSI character**](#gt_ansi-character) string "Microsoft::Windows::RDS::Input". The usage of channel names in the context of opening a dynamic virtual channel is specified in [MS-RDPEDYC] section 2.2.2.1. The "Microsoft::Windows::RDS::Input" dynamic virtual channel SHOULD NOT be opened by the client if a touch digitizer is not present.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

The following sections specify the Remote Desktop Protocol: Input Virtual Channel Extension message syntax. All multiple-byte fields within a message MUST be marshaled in [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) byte order, unless otherwise specified.

#### 3.1.1.1 Touch Contact State Transitions

The following finite state machine diagram describes the states through which a contact involved in a touch or pen transaction can transition during its lifetime.

![Lifetime of a touch or pen contact](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: Lifetime of a touch or pen contact

A contact transitions through three main states:

- Out of Range
- Hovering
- Engaged
When a contact is in the "hovering" or "engaged" state, it is referred to as being "active". "Hovering" contacts are in range of the digitizer, while "engaged" contacts are in range of the digitizer and in contact with the digitizer surface. The Remote Desktop Protocol: Input Virtual Channel Extension remotes only active contacts and contacts that are transitioning to the "out of range" state; see section [2.2.3.3.1.1](#Section_2.2.3.3.1.1) for an enumeration of valid state flags combinations.

When transitioning from the "engaged" state to the "hovering" state, or from the "engaged" state to the "out of range" state, the contact position cannot change; it is only allowed to change after the transition has taken place.

#### 3.1.5.1 Processing an Input Message

All input messages are prefaced by the [RDPINPUT_HEADER (section 2.2.2.6)](#Section_2.2.2.6) structure.

When an input message is processed, the **eventId** field in the header MUST first be examined to determine if the message is within the subset of expected messages. If the message is not expected, it SHOULD be ignored.

If the message is in the correct sequence, the **pduLength** field MUST be examined to make sure that it is consistent with the amount of data read from the "Microsoft::Windows::RDS::Input" dynamic virtual channel (section [2.1](#Section_2.1)). If this is not the case, the message SHOULD be ignored.

### 3.3.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

**Note** It is possible to implement the following conceptual data by using a variety of techniques as long as the implementation produces external behavior that is consistent with that described in this document.

<a id="Section_3.3.1.1"></a>
#### 3.3.1.1 Input Transmission Suspended

The **Input Transmission Suspended** abstract data model (ADM) element contains a Boolean value that indicates whether the capture, encoding, and transmission of touch and pen frames on the client have been suspended. This value is toggled by the receipt of the [RDPINPUT_SUSPEND_INPUT_PDU (section 2.2.3.4)](#Section_2.2.3.4) message, as specified in section [3.3.5.4](#Section_3.3.5.4), and the [RDPINPUT_RESUME_INPUT_PDU (section 2.2.3.5)](#Section_2.2.3.5)message, as specified in section [3.3.5.5](#Section_3.3.5.5).

<a id="Section_3.3.1.2"></a>
#### 3.3.1.2 Pen Input Allowed

The **Pen Input Allowed** abstract data model (ADM) element contains a Boolean value that indicates whether the server supports the injection of pen input using the [RDPINPUT_PEN_EVENT_PDU (section 2.2.3.7)](#Section_2.2.3.7) message. This value is set by the client when processing the [RDPINPUT_SC_READY_PDU (section 2.2.3.1)](#Section_2.2.3.1) message, as specified in section [3.3.5.1](#Section_3.3.5.1).

<a id="Section_3.3.2"></a>
### 3.3.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.3.3"></a>
### 3.3.3 Initialization

The client SHOULD NOT open the "Microsoft::Windows::RDS::Input" virtual channel transport (section [2.1](#Section_2.1)) if a physical or virtual touch digitizer is not attached to the system.

<a id="Section_3.3.4"></a>
### 3.3.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.3.5"></a>
### 3.3.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1"></a>
#### 3.3.5.1 Processing an RDPINPUT_SC_READY_PDU message

The structure and fields of the **RDPINPUT_SC_READY_PDU** message are specified in section [2.2.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.1).

The **header** field MUST be processed as specified in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1). If the message is valid, the client SHOULD respond by sending the [RDPINPUT_CS_READY_PDU (section 2.2.3.2)](#Section_2.2.3.2) message to the server, as specified in section [3.3.5.2](#Section_3.3.5.2). If the **protocolVersion** field of the **RDPINPUT_SC_READY_PDU** message is set to at least RDPINPUT_PROTOCOL_V200 (0x00020000), then the client SHOULD set the **Pen Input Allowed** (section [3.3.1.2](#Section_3.3.1.2)) ADM element to TRUE.

After sending the **RDPINPUT_CS_READY_PDU** message to the server, the client SHOULD start remoting multitouch and pen input frames by sending the [RDPINPUT_TOUCH_EVENT_PDU (section 2.2.3.3)](#Section_2.2.3.3) and [RDPINPUT_PEN_EVENT_PDU (section 2.2.3.7)](#Section_2.2.3.7) messages to the server, as specified in sections [3.3.5.3](#Section_3.3.5.3) and [3.3.5.7](#Section_3.3.5.7), respectively.

The structure and fields of the **RDPINPUT_CS_READY_PDU** message are specified in section [2.2.3.2](#Section_2.2.3.2).

The client MUST populate the **maxTouchContacts** field to indicate the maximum number of touch contacts that can be active at any given point in time. This value is the sum of the maximum active contacts supported by each touch digitizer attached to the client.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.3"></a>
#### 3.3.5.3 Sending an RDPINPUT_TOUCH_EVENT_PDU message

The structure and fields of the **RDPINPUT_TOUCH_EVENT_PDU** message are specified in section [2.2.3.3](#Section_2.2.3.3).

Each RDPINPUT_TOUCH_EVENT_PDU (section 2.2.3.3) message contains an array of [RDPINPUT_TOUCH_FRAME (section 2.2.3.3.1)](#Section_2.2.3.3.1.1) structures, and each frame contains an array of [RDPINPUT_TOUCH_CONTACT (section 2.2.3.3.1.1)](#Section_2.2.3.3.1.1) structures. Every **RDPINPUT_TOUCH_CONTACT** structure represents the state and attributes of an active contact; see section [3.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.1.1) for a description of permissible touch contact state transitions.

Every touch frame received by the client from a touch digitizer MUST be encoded as an **RDPINPUT_TOUCH_FRAME** structure, the contacts being encoded as **RDPINPUT_TOUCH_CONTACT** structures. The number of encoded frames depends on the rate at which the digitizer generates touch frames. Once the touch frames have been encoded, they MUST be encapsulated in an **RDPINPUT_TOUCH_EVENT_PDU** message.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.4"></a>
#### 3.3.5.4 Processing an RDPINPUT_SUSPEND_INPUT_PDU message

The structure and fields of the **RDPINPUT_SUSPEND_INPUT_PDU** message are specified in section [2.2.3.4](#Section_2.2.3.4).

The **header** field MUST be processed as specified in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1). If the message is valid, the client MUST set the **Input Transmission Suspended** (section [3.3.1.1](#Section_3.3.1.1)) ADM element to TRUE and MUST suspend the transmission of input messages to the server. If the **Input Transmission Suspended** ADM element is already set to TRUE, the client SHOULD ignore this message.

#### 3.3.5.5 Processing an RDPINPUT_RESUME_INPUT_PDU message

The structure and fields of the **RDPINPUT_RESUME_INPUT_PDU** message are specified in section [2.2.3.5](#Section_2.2.3.5).

The **header** field MUST be processed as specified in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1). If the message is valid, the client SHOULD set the **Input Transmission Suspended** (section [3.3.1.1](#Section_3.3.1.1)) ADM element to FALSE and MUST resume the transmission of input messages to the server. If the **Input Transmission Suspended** ADM element is already set to FALSE, the client SHOULD ignore this message.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.6"></a>
#### 3.3.5.6 Sending an RDPINPUT_DISMISS_HOVERING_TOUCH_CONTACT_PDU message

The structure and fields of the **RDPINPUT_DISMISS_HOVERING_TOUCH_CONTACT_PDU** message are specified in section [2.2.3.6](#Section_2.2.3.6).

The **contactId** field MUST be initialized with the ID of a valid hovering contact that has to be transitioned to the "out of range" state.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.7"></a>
#### 3.3.5.7 Sending an RDPINPUT_PEN_EVENT_PDU message

The structure and fields of the **RDPINPUT_PEN_EVENT_PDU** message are specified in section [2.2.3.7](#Section_2.2.3.7).
