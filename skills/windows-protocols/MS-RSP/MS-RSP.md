# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Remote Shutdown Protocol. The Remote Shutdown Protocol is a remote procedure call (RPC)-based protocol used to shut down or terminate shutdown on a remote computer.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_client"></a>
**client**: A computer on which the remote procedure call (RPC) client is executing.

<a id="gt_endpoint"></a>
**endpoint**: A network-specific address of a remote procedure call (RPC) server process for remote procedure calls. The actual name and type of the endpoint depends on the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol sequence that is being used. For example, for RPC over TCP (RPC Protocol Sequence ncacn_ip_tcp), an endpoint might be TCP port 1025. For RPC over Server Message Block (RPC Protocol Sequence ncacn_np), an endpoint might be the name of a [**named pipe**](#gt_named-pipe). For more information, see [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824).

<a id="gt_handle"></a>
**handle**: Any token that can be used to identify and access an object such as a device, file, or a window.

<a id="gt_interface-definition-language-idl"></a>
**Interface Definition Language (IDL)**: The International Standards Organization (ISO) standard language for specifying the interface for remote procedure calls. For more information, see [C706] section 4.

<a id="gt_named-pipe"></a>
**named pipe**: A named, one-way, or duplex pipe for communication between a pipe server and one or more pipe clients.

<a id="gt_opnum"></a>
**opnum**: An operation number or numeric identifier that is used to identify a specific [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) method or a method in an interface. For more information, see [C706] section 12.5.2.12 or [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

<a id="gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc"></a>
**remote procedure call (RPC)**: A communication protocol used primarily between client and server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message). For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_rpc-protocol-sequence"></a>
**RPC protocol sequence**: A character string that represents a valid combination of a [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol, a network layer protocol, and a transport layer protocol, as described in [C706] and [MS-RPCE].

<a id="gt_server"></a>
**server**: A computer on which the [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) server is executing.

<a id="gt_server-message-block-smb"></a>
**Server Message Block (SMB)**: A protocol that is used to request file and print services from server systems over a network. The SMB protocol extends the CIFS protocol with additional security, file, and disk management support. For more information, see [[CIFS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109334) and [MS-SMB](../MS-SMB/MS-SMB.md).

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [C706] must be used for generating the UUID.

<a id="gt_well-known-endpoint"></a>
**well-known endpoint**: A preassigned, network-specific, stable address for a particular client/server instance. For more information, see [C706].

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

The Remote Shutdown Protocol is designed for shutting down a remote computer or for terminating the shutdown of a remote computer during the shutdown waiting period. Following are some of the examples of this protocol's applications:

- Shut down a remote computer and display a message in the shutdown dialog box for 30 seconds.
- Terminate a requested remote system shutdown during the shutdown waiting period.
- Force applications to be closed, log off users, and shut down a remote computer.
- Reboot a remote computer.
In this document, the use of the terms [**client**](#gt_client) and [**server**](#gt_server) are in the protocol client and server context. This means that the client will initiate an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) call and the server will respond.

This is an RPC-based protocol. The protocol operation is stateless.

This is a simple request-response protocol. For every method that the server receives, it executes the method and returns a completion. The client simply returns the completion status to the caller. This is a stateless protocol; each method call is independent of any previous method calls.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Remote Shutdown Protocol is dependent upon [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) and [**SMB**](#gt_server-message-block-smb) for its transport. For the InitShutdown interface (section [3.2](#Section_3.2)), this protocol uses RPC [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) over [**named pipes**](#gt_named-pipe). Named pipes, in turn, use the SMB protocol [MS-SMB](../MS-SMB/MS-SMB.md).

No other protocol currently depends on the Remote Shutdown Protocol.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Remote Shutdown Protocol is an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interface and, as a result, has the prerequisites specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) (section 1.5) as being common to RPC interfaces.

It is assumed that a Remote Shutdown Protocol client has obtained the name of a remote computer that supports the Remote Shutdown Protocol before this protocol is invoked.

All remote shutdown methods are RPC calls from the client to the server that perform the complete operation in a single call. No shared state between the client and server is assumed.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is only appropriate for shutting down a remote computer or terminating shutdown during the shutdown waiting period.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

- **Supported Transports:** The Remote Shutdown Protocol uses [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over [**named pipes**](#gt_named-pipe) and RPC over TCP/IP as its only transports. The protocol sequences are specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).
- **Protocol Versions:** Information about RPC versioning and capability negotiation in this situation is specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) (section 1.7).
- **Security and Authentication Methods:** As specified in [MS-RPCE] section 3.2.1.4.1.
<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol cannot be extended by any party other than Microsoft.

This protocol uses Win32 error codes. These values are taken from the Windows error number space specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md). Vendors SHOULD reuse those values with their indicated meaning. Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the future.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

This protocol has no standards assignments.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

This protocol uses the following [**RPC protocol sequences**](#gt_rpc-protocol-sequence) as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) (sections 2.1.1.1 for TCP/IP - NCACN_IP_TCP, 2.1.1.2 for SMB - NCACN_NP):

- [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over TCP/IP (for the WindowsShutdown RPC interface)
- RPC over [**named pipes**](#gt_named-pipe) (for the WinReg and InitShutdown RPC interfaces)
This protocol uses the following RPC [**endpoints**](#gt_endpoint):

- dynamic endpoints as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) part 4 (for the WindowsShutdown RPC interface)
- [**well-known endpoint**](#gt_well-known-endpoint) \PIPE\InitShutdown over named pipes (for the InitShutdown RPC interface)
- well-known endpoint \PIPE\winreg over named pipes (for the WinReg RPC interface)
This protocol MUST use the following [**UUIDs**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid):

- WinReg Interface: 338CD001-2244-31F1-AAAA-900038001003
- InitShutdown Interface: 894DE0C0-0D55-11D3-A322-00C04FA321A1
- WindowsShutdown Interface: D95AFE70-A6D5-4259-822E-2C84DA1DDB0D
<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Common Data Types

This protocol MUST indicate to the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) runtime that it is to support both the NDR and NDR64 transfer syntaxes and provide a negotiation mechanism for determining which transfer syntax will be used ([MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.1.1.5.1.1).

In addition to RPC base types and definitions specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-RPCE], additional data types are defined in this section.

The following list summarizes the datatypes that are defined in this specification:

- [PREGISTRY_SERVER_NAME (section 2.2.1)](#Section_2.2.1)
- [REG_UNICODE_STRING (section 2.2.2)](#Section_2.2.2)
<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 RPC Binding Handles for Remote Shutdown Methods

[**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding is the process of creating a logical connection between a [**client**](#gt_client) and a [**server**](#gt_server). The information that composes the binding between client and server is represented by a structure called a binding handle. RPC binding handles are specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.1.1.5.1.1.2.

All remote shutdown RPC methods accept an RPC binding [**handle**](#gt_handle) as the first parameter. The shutdown methods (sections [3.3.4.1](#Section_3.3.4.1) and [3.3.4.2](#Section_3.3.4.2)) use an RPC primitive binding handle. The WinReg and InitShutdown RPC methods use a custom binding handle.

This type is declared as follows:

typedef [handle] wchar_t* PREGISTRY_SERVER_NAME;

This custom binding handle is actually a wrapper around a primitive RPC binding handle (type handle_t); the PREGISTRY_SERVER_NAME type is maintained only for backward. This custom binding handle is mapped to a primitive binding handle using bind and unbind routines, as specified in [MS-RPCE].

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 REG_UNICODE_STRING

This **REG_UNICODE_STRING** structure represents a counted string of Unicode (UTF-16) characters.

typedef struct _REG_UNICODE_STRING {

unsigned short Length;

unsigned short MaximumLength;

[size_is(MaximumLength/2), length_is(Length/2)]

unsigned short* Buffer;

} REG_UNICODE_STRING,

*PREG_UNICODE_STRING;

**Length:** The number of bytes actually used by the string. Because all UTF-16 characters occupy 2 bytes, this MUST be an even number in the range [0...65534]. The behavior for odd values is unspecified.

**MaximumLength:** The number of bytes allocated for the string. This MUST be an even number in the range [**Length**...65534].

**Buffer:** The Unicode UTF-16 characters comprising the string described by the structure. Note that counted strings might be terminated by a 0x0000 character, by convention; if such a terminator is present, it SHOULD NOT count toward the **Length** (but MUST, of course, be included in the **MaximumLength**).

<a id="Section_2.3"></a>
## 2.3 Shutdown Reasons

This dwReason type is declared as follows:

typedef ULONG dwReason;

Some [**opnums**](#gt_opnum) allow the transmission of a shutdown reason. This reason is composed of a major reason code, an optional minor reason code, and optional flags, which MUST be a bitwise OR of the flags.

Major reason codes are described in the following table.

# 3 Protocol Details

The remote shutdown [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interfaces are used to shut down or, during the shutdown waiting period, abort shutdown on a remote computer.

This section presents the details of the Remote Shutdown Protocol:

- Section [3.1](#Section_3.1) specifies the WinReg RPC interface.
- Section [3.2](#Section_3.2) specifies the InitShutdown RPC interface.
- Section [3.3](#Section_3.3) specifies the WindowsShutdown RPC interface.
All remote shutdown methods return 0x00000000 on success; otherwise, they return a 32-bit, nonzero Win32 error code. For more information on Win32 error values, see [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md).

The default pointer type for the shutdown RPC interface is pointer_default(unique). Method calls are received at a dynamically assigned [**endpoint**](#gt_endpoint) ([MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.1.1.1). The endpoints for the Netlogon service are negotiated by the RPC endpoint mapper ([MS-RPCE] section 2.1.1.1).

The client side of this protocol is simply a pass-through. That is, there are no additional timers or other states required on the client side of this protocol. Calls made by the higher-layer protocol or application are passed directly to the transport, and the results returned by the transport are passed directly back to the higher-layer protocol or application.

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 WinReg Server Details

The following section specifies data and state maintained by the WinReg [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) [**server**](#gt_server). It includes details about receiving WinReg RPC methods on the server side of the client-server communication. The provided data is to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This section does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This is an RPC-based protocol. The [**server**](#gt_server) does not maintain [**client**](#gt_client) state information. The protocol operation is stateless.

This is a simple request-response protocol. For every method that the server receives, it executes the method and returns a completion. The client simply returns the completion status to the caller. This is a stateless protocol; each method call is independent of any previous method calls.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

No protocol timers are required beyond those used internally by [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) to implement resiliency to network outages.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The WinReg [**server**](#gt_server) side registers an [**endpoint**](#gt_endpoint) with [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over named pipes transport ([MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.1.1.2), using the "\PIPE\Shutdown" [**named pipe**](#gt_named-pipe).

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

This protocol MUST indicate to the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) runtime that it is to perform a strict NDR data consistency check at target level 5.0 ([MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.1.1.5.3).

Remote shutdown communication between a client and a server occurs through RPC calls.

The WinReg interface includes the following methods.<3>

## 3.2 InitShutdown Server Details

The following section specifies data and state maintained by the InitShutdown [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) server. It includes details about receiving InitShutdown RPC methods on the server side of the client-server communication. The provided data is to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This section does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model, as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

<a id="Section_3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This is an RPC-based protocol. The [**server**](#gt_server) does not maintain [**client**](#gt_client) state information. The protocol operation is stateless.

This is a simple request-response protocol. For every method that the server receives, it executes the method and returns a completion. The client simply returns the completion status to the caller. This is a stateless protocol; each method call is independent of any previous method calls.

<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

No protocol timers are required beyond those used internally by [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) to implement resiliency to network outages.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

The InitShutdown interface [**server**](#gt_server) side registers an [**endpoint**](#gt_endpoint) with [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over [**named pipe**](#gt_named-pipe)s transport ([MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.1.1.2), using the "\PIPE\InitShutdown" named pipe.

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

This protocol MUST indicate to the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) runtime that it is to perform a strict NDR data consistency check at target level 5.0 ([MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.1.1.5.3).

The **InitShutdown** interface includes the following methods.<7>

Methods in RPC Opnum Order

#### 3.3.4.1 WsdrInitiateShutdown (Opnum 0)

The **WsdrInitiateShutdown** method is used to initiate the shutdown of the remote computer.<14>

unsigned long WsdrInitiateShutdown(

[ in ] handle_t Binding,

[ in, unique ] PREG_UNICODE_STRING lpMessage,

[ in ] unsigned long dwGracePeriod,

[ in ] unsigned long dwShudownFlags,

[ in ] unsigned long dwReason,

[ in, unique ] PREG_UNICODE_STRING lpClientHint);

**Binding:** Primitive [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) [**handle**](#gt_handle) that identifies a particular client/server binding.

**lpMessage:** Null-terminated Unicode string that contains the message to display during the shutdown waiting period. If this parameter is NULL, no message MUST be displayed.

**dwGracePeriod:** Number of seconds to wait before shutting down.

**dwShudownFlags:** A set of bit flags in little-endian format used as a mask to indicate shutdown options. The value is constructed from zero or more bit flags from the following table, with the exception that flag "B" cannot be combined with "C" or "D".

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-0: "0"
  1-1: "0"
  2-2: "0"
  3-3: "0"
  4-4: "0"
  5-5: "0"
  6-6: "0"
  7-7: "0"
  8-8: "0"

  28-28: "C"
  29-29: "B"
  30-30: "0"
  31-31: "A"
```

The bits are defined as follows.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| A 0x00000001 | All applications SHOULD be terminated unconditionally. An alternate for this field is SHUTDOWN_FORCE_OTHERS. |
| B 0x00000004 | Restart computer. Cannot be used with "C" or "D". An alternate name for this field is SHUTDOWN_RESTART. |
| C 0x00000008 | The shutdown SHOULD turn off the computer. Cannot be used with "B" or "D". An alternate name for this field is SHUTDOWN_POWEROFF. |
| D 0x00000010 | The shutdown SHOULD leave the computer powered but SHOULD NOT cause a reboot. Cannot be used with "B" or "C". An alternate name for this field is SHUTDOWN_NOREBOOT. |
| E 0x00000020 | If a shutdown is currently in progress, setting this bit on a subsequent shutdown request SHOULD cause the ongoing request's waiting period to be ignored and SHOULD cause an immediate shutdown. An alternate name for this field is SHUTDOWN_GRACE_OVERRIDE. |
| F 0x00000040 | The shutdown SHOULD install pending software updates before proceeding. An alternate name for this field is SHUTDOWN_INSTALL_UPDATES. |
| G 0x00000080 | The shutdown SHOULD restart the computer and then restart any applications that have registered for restart. An alternate name for this field is SHUTDOWN_RESTARTAPPS. |

All other bits MUST be zero and ignored upon receipt.

**dwReason:** Reason for initiating the shutdown (section [2.3](#Section_2.3)). The **dwReason** SHOULD be used for log entries for the shutdown event.

**lpClientHint:** Used only for diagnostic purposes (logging the image file name of the process initiating a shutdown).

**Return Values:** The method returns ERROR_SUCCESS (0x00000000) on success; otherwise, it returns a nonzero error code.

On receiving this call, the server MUST perform the following validation step:

- Verify that the caller has sufficient privileges to shut down the computer; otherwise, the server MUST return ERROR_BAD_NETPATH.
If there are other sessions logged on and "A" is not set, the server MUST return ERROR_SHUTDOWN_USERS_LOGGED_ON.

The shutdown SHOULD turn off the computer when "B," "C," and "D" are not set or when multiple bits are set.

<a id="Section_3.3.4.2"></a>
#### 3.3.4.2 WsdrAbortShutdown (Opnum 1)

The **WsdrAbortShutdown** method is used to terminate the shutdown of the remote computer within the waiting period.<15>

unsigned long WsdrAbortShutdown(

[in] handle_t Binding,

[in, unique] PREG_UNICODE_STRING lpClientHint

);

**Binding:** Primitive [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) [**handle**](#gt_handle) that identifies a particular client/server binding.

**lpClientHint:** Used only for diagnostic purposes (logging the image file name of the process canceling a shutdown).

**Return Values:** The method returns ERROR_SUCCESS (0x00000000) on success; otherwise, it returns a nonzero error code.

On receiving this call, the server MUST perform the following validation step:

# 4 Protocol Examples

The following example shows a sample call from a [**client**](#gt_client) to a [**server**](#gt_server), asking the server to reboot in 30 seconds and to display a message.

In this example, the client contacts the server with the following [WsdrInitiateShutdown](#Section_3.3.4.1) call.

ULONG = (return value, not yet set)

WsdrInitiateShutdown(

[ in ] handle_t Binding = (set by RpcBindingFromStringBinding()),

[ in, unique ] PREG_UNICODE_STRING lpMessage =

L"Restarting system. Please save your work.",

[ in ] DWORD dwGracePeriod = 30,

[ in ] DWORD dwShudownFlags = SHUTDOWN_RESTART,

[ in ] DWORD dwReason = SHUTDN_MAJOR_OTHER,

[ in, unique ] PREG_UNICODE_STRING lpClientHint = L""

);

The server receives this call, verifies that the caller has sufficient privileges to shut down the computer, displays the message to the interactively logged on users, and after waiting 30 seconds, reboots the server.

The server responds with the following WsdrInitiateShutdown return.

ULONG = ERROR_SUCCESS

WsdrInitiateShutdown(

[ in ] handle_t Binding = (unchanged),

[ in, unique ] PREG_UNICODE_STRING lpMessage = (unchanged),

[ in ] DWORD dwGracePeriod = (unchanged),

[ in ] DWORD dwShudownFlags = (unchanged),
