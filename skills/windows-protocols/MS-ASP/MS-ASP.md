# 1 Introduction

The ASP.NET State Server Protocol is a contract for transmitting session state data between a client and a state server. This protocol is used for interaction between a client application that requires persistent session state storage, and an out-of-process state server responsible for storing session state. The data that flows between the client application and a state server is transmitted using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_application-domain"></a>
**application domain**: A virtual process space within which managed code applications are hosted and executed. It is possible to have multiple managed code applications running inside a single process. Each managed code application runs within its own [**application domain**](#gt_application-domain) and is isolated from other applications that are running in separate [**application domains**](#gt_application-domain). An application domain has a unique identifier used as part of the identifying key on a state server when storing and retrieving session data.

<a id="gt_aspnet"></a>
**ASP.NET**: A web server technology for dynamically rendering HTML pages using a combination of HTML, Javascript, CSS, and server-side logic. For more information, see [[ASPNET]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89815).

<a id="gt_aspnet-state-server"></a>
**ASP.NET state server**: A Windows service that provides a default server implementation of the ASP.NET State Server Protocol. When the service is enabled on a computer, that computer can act as a state server. The state server accepts requests to load, store, delete, and temporarily lock [**Session state**](#gt_session-state) items.

<a id="gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http"></a>
**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: An application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the World Wide Web.

<a id="gt_session-state"></a>
**session state**: In [**ASP.NET**](#gt_aspnet), a variable store on a server for storing and retrieving values for a user while the user navigates ASP.NET pages in a web application. Session state is typically used to store user-specific information between postbacks. Each user maintains a separate session state on the server.

<a id="gt_uniform-resource-locator-url"></a>
**Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**: A string of characters in a standardized format that identifies a document or resource on the World Wide Web. The format is as specified in [[RFC1738]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90287).

<a id="gt_user-session-identifier"></a>
**user session identifier**: A unique identifier used as part of the identifying key when storing and retrieving session data.

<a id="gt_web-application-identifier"></a>
**web application identifier**: Each [**ASP.NET**](#gt_aspnet) application running on a web server is uniquely identified with a [**web application identifier**](#gt_web-application-identifier). The [**web application identifier**](#gt_web-application-identifier) is the virtual path of the web application on the web server. A [**web application identifier**](#gt_web-application-identifier) is used as part of the identifying key on a state server when storing and retrieving session data for a specific browser session.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

Web applications need to store state information that is associated with a specific user session. Earlier web technologies, such as Active Server Pages (ASP), included a [**session state**](#gt_session-state) feature that stored state information in memory. [**ASP.NET**](#gt_aspnet) also has an implementation of in-memory session state.

However, in-memory session state solutions are not suitable for web farms (clusters of two or more web servers). In web farms there is no guarantee that a user session will reconnect to the same web server across multiple requests. As a result, if an in-memory session state solution is used, session data will appear to be lost when the user session connects to different servers.

The ASP.NET State Server Protocol was developed to address the use of session state in a web farm. A session state server can host an out of process session state store. Client applications such as web applications can store and retrieve session data across a web farm as long as each instance of the application is pointed at the same state server instance. The ASP.NET State Server Protocol specifies the rules for communicating session state data between a client application and a state server.

When using the ASP.NET State Server Protocol, there is a client and a server component to each network conversation. The general sequence is as follows:

- A client application runs code that requires session state. For example, a web application could process a browser request, and as part of the processing, the application needs to access the session state associated with the browser session.
- The client sends an [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http) request to the state server to retrieve session state. The request includes an identifier that correlates to the browser's user session, as well as an identifier for the specific web application making the request.
- The state server receives the request, and based upon the [**user session identifier**](#gt_user-session-identifier), [**application domain**](#gt_application-domain) identifier, and [**web application identifier**](#gt_web-application-identifier), retrieves the requested session data. The session data is returned in an HTTP response to the client.
- The application code accesses session state, getting and setting values as necessary.
- When the client finishes processing a request, it makes an HTTP request to the state server to save any changes application code has made to session state. This request contains the updated session state data, as well user session, application domain, and web application identifiers.
- The state server accepts the HTTP request to update state data. It stores the information keyed by the user session identifier, application domain identifier, and application identifier.
<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The [**ASP.NET state server**](#gt_aspnet-state-server) relies on [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http) (as specified in [[RFC2616]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90372)).

The [**URL**](#gt_uniform-resource-locator-url) for the ASP.NET state server follows the definitions in "Uniform Resource Locators (URL)," as specified in [[RFC1738]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90287).

The allowable characters for strings that are defined in section [2.2.1.6](#Section_2.2.1.6) come from the definition of a relative URI that is defined in "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax," as specified in [[RFC2396]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90339).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The ASP.NET State Server Protocol is used when a client application communicates with a state server. Client and server implementations of the ASP.NET State Server Protocol need to agree on how a client discovers a state server. Implementations need to agree on how a state server starts up and becomes available to process requests.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The ASP.NET State Server Protocol is intended for use by clients that need to store [**session state**](#gt_session-state) data outside the process space of the client application.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

The ASP.NET State Server Protocol includes version information in server response messages that a client can use to implement versioning behavior.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

None.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

The following sections specify transport for the ASP.NET State Server Protocol and details of message syntax, including common structures, certificate requirements, and common error codes.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The ASP.NET State Server Protocol uses [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http), as specified in [[RFC2616]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90372), as the transport layer. The client indicates the requested data as part of an HTTP request header, and packages request data, as specified in section [3.2](#Section_3.2).

State server implementations MUST accept the request data and provide responses according to the specifications in section [3.1](#Section_3.1).

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>

#### 2.2.5.1 Get_Request

The Get_Request message is sent by a client to request [**session state**](#gt_session-state) data in a non-exclusive manner. If multiple instances of the same user session are active, the request for session state data will not block session state requests from other instances of the same user session.

#### 2.2.5.3 GetExclusive_Request

The GetExclusive_Request message is sent by a client to request [**session state**](#gt_session-state) data in an exclusive manner. This means the current requestor wants an exclusive lock to be maintained on the session state data until the current requestor releases the lock. If other instances of the user session request the same session state data, they will not receive any session data in a response because the current requestor has already locked it for exclusive access.

## 3.1 Server Details

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

An application that operates in a stateless manner can store data associated with certain transient operations. If a unique identifier is flowed from one transient operation to another, it is possible for an application to store data externally keyed to this unique identifier. Client applications can load this data by providing a unique key to a state server implementation.

A state server provides the service for externally storing such data. It operates against a virtual storage model, where individual pieces of data are indexed via a unique identifier. Each unique identifier points to a table of name-value pairs containing [**session state**](#gt_session-state) information.

When a client requests session state information, the server finds the unique identifier and returns the name-value pairs associated with that key. When a client updates session state information, it provides the state server with the unique key and a set of name-value pairs. The state server stores the name-value pairs and associates them with the unique key for subsequent retrieval.

The state server supports basic locking semantics to ensure that concurrent read and write attempts do not corrupt session state.

### 3.1.5 Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>
#### 3.1.5.1 Processing Non-Exclusive Get Requests

A client that uses a state server makes either an exclusive or a non-exclusive request to a state server implementation for [**session state**](#gt_session-state) data.<6>

For a non-exclusive request, the client sends an [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http) request that uses the message format that is specified in section [2.2.5.1](#Section_2.2.5.1). A state server implementation MUST attempt to retrieve the session state data that corresponds to the [unique identifier](#Section_2.2.3.13) that is contained in the combination of [application-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.1), [appdomain-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.2), and [session-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.3). A state server MUST not interpret these values or assign any specific relevance to them. Rather, a state server implementation MUST simply use the combination of those values as the unique identifier for retrieving any previously stored session state that is associated with the combination of those identifiers.

The state server MUST send a response back to the client by using one of the message formats that are specified in section [2.2.5.2](#Section_2.2.5.2).

If the state server finds session data that is associated with the requested identifier, and the data is not locked by another request, it MUST reply to the client web server by using the response-ok message, as specified in section 2.2.5.2.

As part of this message, the state server MUST include the action-flags information if set during a previous set operation, as specified in section [2.2.5.5](#Section_2.2.5.5), the client web server sent extra-flags to the state server with a value of "1". The state server MUST also reset the action-flags value stored by the state server to a value of "0".

If the state server finds session data that is associated with the requested identifier, but the session data is locked by another request (for example, two or more clients are simultaneously running and each client is using the same identifier), the state server MUST respond with a response-locked message, as specified in section 2.2.5.2. The response-locked message contains a [lock-age (section 2.2.3.10)](#Section_2.2.3.10) and [lock-date (section 2.2.3.8)](#Section_2.2.3.8) in addition to the value of the current [lock-cookie (section 2.2.3.9)](#Section_2.2.3.9). The lock-cookie is an integer representation of the current lock. The lock-date value MUST contain the date and time that the existing lock was placed on the session state data. The lock-age header MUST contain a representation for the age of the current lock.

If the state server cannot find any session data that is associated with the requested identifier, the state server MUST respond with a response-not-found message, as specified in section 2.2.5.2.

The response-bad-request message, as specified in section 2.2.5.2, is conceptually equivalent to throwing an exception. The session state server MUST send this message if something goes wrong and the server is unable to process the request.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2"></a>
#### 3.1.5.2 Processing Exclusive Get Requests

A client that uses a state server makes either an exclusive or a non-exclusive request to a state server implementation for [**session state**](#gt_session-state) data.<7>

For an exclusive request, the client uses the message format that is specified in section [2.2.5.3](#Section_2.2.5.3). A state server implementation MUST attempt to retrieve the session state data that corresponds to the [unique identifier](#Section_2.2.3.13) that is contained in the combination of [application-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.1), [appdomain-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.2), and [session-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.3). A state server MUST NOT interpret these values or assign any specific relevance to them. Rather, a state server implementation MUST simply use the combination of those values as the unique identifier for retrieving any previously stored session state that is associated with the combination of those identifiers.

The state server MUST send a response back to the client by using one of the message formats that are specified in section [2.2.5.4](#Section_2.2.5.4).

If the state server finds session data that is associated with the requested identifier and the data is not locked by another request, it MUST reply to the client with the response-ok message.

As part of this message, the state server MUST include the action-flags information, if during a previous set operation, as specified in section [2.2.5.5](#Section_2.2.5.5), the client web server sent extra-flags to the state server with a value of "1". The state server MUST also reset the action-flags value stored by the state server to a value of "0".

The state server MUST also internally mark the session data in a way that indicates the session data is now considered locked, and is not available to other requestors. As part of this logical operation, the state server MUST return an integer representation of the lock to the client. The [lock-cookie (section 2.2.3.9)](#Section_2.2.3.9) portion of the response-ok message is where the state server MUST include this lock information in its response. Internally, the state server MUST also note the date and time when the lock is established.

If the state server finds session data that is associated with the requested identifier but the session data is locked by another request (that is, two or more clients are simultaneously running, and each client is using the same identifier), the state server MUST respond by using a response-locked message, as specified in section 2.2.5.4. The response-locked message contains a [lock-age (section 2.2.3.10)](#Section_2.2.3.10) and [lock-date (section 2.2.3.8)](#Section_2.2.3.8) in addition to the value of the current lock-cookie. The lock-cookie is an integer representation of the current lock. The lock-date value MUST contain the date and time the existing lock was placed on the session state data. The lock-age header MUST contain a representation for the age of the current lock.

If the state server cannot find any session data that is associated with the requested identifier, the state server MUST respond with a response-not-found message, as specified in section 2.2.5.4.

The response-bad-request message, as specified in section 2.2.5.4, is conceptually equivalent to throwing an exception. The session state server MUST send this message if something goes wrong and the server is unable to process the request.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.3"></a>
#### 3.1.5.3 Saving Session Data with a Set Request

When a client needs to store session data in an out-of-process state server, it makes a request to the state server by using the message format that is specified in section [2.2.5.5](#Section_2.2.5.5).

A state server MUST associate the session data that is contained in this message with a [unique identifier](#Section_2.2.3.13) that is created from the combination of [application-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.1), [appdomain-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.2), and [session-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.3). A state server MUST not interpret these values or assign any specific relevance to them. Rather, a state server implementation MUST simply use the combination of those values as the unique identifier for storing [**session state**](#gt_session-state) associated with the combination of those identifiers.

The state server MUST send a response back to the client by using one of the message formats that are specified in section [2.2.5.6](#Section_2.2.5.6).

If the state server does not currently have any session data associated with the requested identifier, it MUST store the session data contained in the message.

If the client sent the optional extra-flags value, the state server MUST also store this information along with the session state data. The state server MUST be able to return this value in the action-flags value of the response messages, as specified in sections [2.2.5.2](#Section_2.2.5.2) and [2.2.5.4](#Section_2.2.5.4).

The state server MUST also store the time-out value that is sent from the client. This time-out value is returned as part of the response-ok messages that are specified in sections 2.2.5.2 and 2.2.5.4. This value is also used when refreshing session state time-outs by using the message as specified in section [2.2.5.11](#Section_2.2.5.11).

Internally, the state server MUST also store the date and time of the current request to save session state. This date and time information is necessary for the state server to remove out-of-date session data. In order to prevent memory or storage exhaustion from storing data for an infinite time period, a state server implementation MUST implement some type of cleanup or scavenging mechanism that can detect expired sessions. A session is considered expired if the current date and time is greater than the session time-out value that is added to the date and time of either the last Set_Request message or the last ResetTimeout_Request message.

If the state server successfully stored the session state, it MUST return a response-ok message.

If the state server does currently have session data associated with the requested identifier, and the client sent the optional extra-flags value, and the optional extra flags value is set to 1, the state server MUST NOT store the session data contained in the message. Instead the state server MUST immediately return a response-ok message.

If the state server is already storing session data that is associated with the requested identifier, but the session data is locked by another request (that is, two or more clients are simultaneously running, and each client is using the same identifier), the state server MUST NOT store the session data contained in the message. Instead the state server MUST respond by using a response-locked message, as specified in section 2.2.5.6. The response-locked message contains a lock-age (section [2.2.3.10](#Section_2.2.3.10)) and lock-date (section [2.2.3.8](#Section_2.2.3.8)) in addition to the value of the current lock-cookie. The lock-cookie is an integer representation of the current lock. The lock-date value MUST contain the date and time the existing lock was placed on the session state data. The lock-age header MUST contain a representation for the age of the current lock.

The response-bad-request message, as specified in section 2.2.5.6, is conceptually equivalent to throwing an exception. The session state server MUST send this message if something goes wrong and the server is unable to process the request.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.4"></a>
#### 3.1.5.4 Releasing an Exclusive Session State Lock

A client can acquire an exclusive lock on a [**session state**](#gt_session-state) by using a successful [GetExclusive_Request](#Section_2.2.5.3) message. The client obtains the lock-cookie value that is associated with a piece of locked session state from the response to a successful GetExclusive_Request message. Alternatively, a client can acquire the [lock-cookie](#Section_2.2.3.9) value of a locked piece of session state from failed calls to GetExclusive_Request or [Get_Request](#Section_2.2.5.1), where a response-locked message was returned.

A client sends a [ReleaseExclusive_Request](#Section_2.2.5.7) message to request that the lock on a piece of session state data be released. A state server implementation MUST construct a [unique identifier](#Section_2.2.3.13) based on the values contained in the combination of [application-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.1), [appdomain-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.2), and [session-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.3). A state server does not need to interpret these values or assign any specific relevance to them. Rather, a state server implementation MUST simply use the combination of those values as the unique identifier for referencing previously stored session state that is associated with the combination of those identifiers.

The state server MUST compare the lock-cookie value that is associated with the unique identifier to the lock-cookie value that is sent by the client. If the values match, the state server MUST release the lock on the session state data and respond to the web server with a response-ok message, as specified in section [2.2.5.8](#Section_2.2.5.8).

If the lock-cookie values do not match, the state server MUST respond by using a response-locked message, as specified in section 2.2.5.8. The response-locked message contains a lock-age (section [2.2.3.10](#Section_2.2.3.10)) and lock-date (section [2.2.3.8](#Section_2.2.3.8)) in addition to the value of the current lock-cookie. The lock-cookie is an integer representation of the current lock. The lock-date value MUST contain the date and time the existing lock was placed on the session state data. The lock-age header MUST contain a representation for the age of the current lock.

If the state server cannot find any session data that is associated with the unique identifier and lock-cookie, the state server MUST respond with a response-not-found message, as specified in section 2.2.5.8.

The response-bad-request message, as specified in section 2.2.5.8, is conceptually equivalent to throwing an exception. The session state server MUST send this message if something goes wrong and the server is unable to process the request.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.5"></a>
#### 3.1.5.5 Removing Session State

A client can acquire an exclusive lock on [**session state**](#gt_session-state) by using a successful [GetExclusive_Request](#Section_2.2.5.3) message. The client obtains that lock-cookie value that is associated with a piece of locked session state from the response to a successful GetExclusive_Request message. Although a client can obtain a [lock-cookie](#Section_2.2.3.9) value from failed attempts to get session state, a client MUST only send a [Remove_Request](#Section_2.2.5.9) message if the client was able to successfully obtain an exclusive lock through a previous GetExclusive_Request operation.

A client sends a Remove_Request message to request that a specific set of session data be removed from the state server. A state server implementation MUST construct a [unique identifier](#Section_2.2.3.13) that is based on the values that are contained in the combination of [application-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.1), [appdomain-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.2), and [session-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.3). A state server does not need to interpret these values or assign any specific relevance to them. Rather a state server implementation MUST simply use the combination of those values as the unique identifier for referencing the previously stored session state that is associated with the combination of those identifiers.

The state server MUST compare the lock-cookie value that is associated with the unique identifier, to the lock-cookie value that is sent by the client. If the values match, the state server MUST remove the corresponding session state data and respond to the web server by using a response-ok message, as specified in section [2.2.5.10](#Section_2.2.5.10).

If the lock-cookie values do not match, the state server MUST respond by using a response-locked message, as specified in section [2.2.5.8](#Section_2.2.5.8). The response-locked message contains a lock-age (section [2.2.3.10](#Section_2.2.3.10)) and lock-date (section [2.2.3.8](#Section_2.2.3.8)) in addition to the value of the current lock-cookie. The lock-cookie is an integer representation of the current lock. The lock-date value MUST contain the date and time that the existing lock was placed on the session state data. The lock-age header MUST contain a representation for the age of the current lock.

If the state server cannot find any session data that is associated with the requested identifier and lock-cookie, the state server MUST respond to the web server by using a response-not-found message, as specified in section 2.2.5.10.

The response-bad-request message, as specified in section 2.2.5.10, is conceptually equivalent to throwing an exception. The session state server MUST send this message if something goes wrong and the server is unable to process the request.

#### 3.1.5.6 Resetting Session State Time-out

A client can send a [ResetTimeout_Request](#Section_2.2.5.11) message to request that a state server refresh the time-out for a specific piece of session data.

A state server implementation MUST construct a [unique identifier](#Section_2.2.3.13) that is based on the values that are contained in the combination of [application-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.1), [appdomain-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.2), and [session-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.3). A state server does not need to interpret these values or assign any specific relevance to them. Rather, a state server implementation MUST simply use the combination of those values as the unique identifier for referencing the previously stored [**session state**](#gt_session-state) that is associated with the combination of those identifiers.

If the state server finds session state data that is associated with the unique identifier, it MUST increase the expiration date of the session state. The new expiration date for the session state data MUST be set to the time-out value. This value was previously supplied as part of a [Set_Request](#Section_2.2.5.5) plus the current date and time on the state server. After the expiration date of the session state has been successfully updated, the state server MUST send a response-ok message to the client, as specified in section [2.2.5.12](#Section_2.2.5.12).

If the state server cannot find any session data that is associated with the requested identifier, the state server MUST respond with a response-not-found message, as specified in section 2.2.5.12.

### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

An application that operates in a stateless manner can need to store data that is associated with certain transient operations. If a unique identifier is flowed from one transient operation to another, it is possible for an application to externally store data that is keyed to this unique identifier. Client applications can load this data by providing a unique key to a state server implementation.<8>

A state server provides the service for externally storing such data. It operates against a virtual storage model, where individual pieces of data are indexed by using a unique identifier. Each unique identifier points at a table of name-value pairs that contain [**session state**](#gt_session-state) information.

When a client requests session state information, the server finds the unique identifier and returns the name-value pairs that are associated with that key. When a client updates session state information, it provides the state server with the unique key and a set of name-value pairs. The state server stores the name-value pairs and associates them with the unique key for subsequent retrieval.

The state server supports basic locking semantics to ensure that concurrent read and write attempts do not corrupt session state.

### 3.2.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

The initialization requirements for client startup are implementation-dependent.<9>

There is one per-request initialization requirement for every client message. All requests to a state server require information that uniquely identifies [**session state**](#gt_session-state) information. The [unique identifier](#Section_2.2.3.13) is a combination of [application identifier](#Section_2.2.3.1), [application domain identifier](#Section_2.2.3.2), and [session identifier](#Section_2.2.3.3). The specific values that are used for these fields are implementation-dependent.<10> However, client implementations MUST ensure that the combined values for these fields are unique. In other words, at least one of the three identifiers has to be unique to ensure that a state server can differentiate between different pieces of session state information.

### 3.2.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1"></a>
#### 3.2.5.1 Non-Exclusive Get Requests

A client that uses a state server makes either an exclusive or a non-exclusive request to a state server implementation for [**session state**](#gt_session-state) data.<11>

For a non-exclusive request, the client sends an [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http) request by using the message format that is specified in section [2.2.5.1](#Section_2.2.5.1).

If the server responds with a response-ok message, as specified in section [2.2.5.2](#Section_2.2.5.2), the client MUST perform implementation-specific initialization tasks if the server returns an action-flags value of "1". However, because this is a non-exclusive get request, a client MUST NOT attempt to send session state updates back to a state server. As a result, any side effects from initialization tasks that change session state information MUST not be sent back to the state server.

If the server responds with a response-locked message, as specified in section 2.2.5.2, the client MAY retain the [lock-cookie](#Section_2.2.3.9), [lock-age](#Section_2.2.3.10), and [lock-date](#Section_2.2.3.8) values for use with custom concurrency handling.<12>

If the server responds with either a response-bad-request or a response-not-found message, as specified in section 2.2.5.2, the client MAY surface some type of error back to the client's caller.<13>

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2"></a>
#### 3.2.5.2 Exclusive Get Requests

A client that uses a state server makes either an exclusive or a non-exclusive request to a state server implementation for [**session state**](#gt_session-state) data.<14>

For an exclusive request, the client sends an [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http) request by using the message format that is specified in section [2.2.5.3](#Section_2.2.5.3).

If the server responds with a response-ok message, as specified in section [2.2.5.4](#Section_2.2.5.4), the client MUST perform implementation-specific initialization tasks if the server returns an action-flags value of "1". The client MUST retain the value of the [lock-cookie](#Section_2.2.3.9) field. If the client needs to update the session state data, it MUST send the same lock-cookie value back to the state server as part of a [Set_Request](#Section_2.2.5.5) message. When the client no longer requires an exclusive lock on the session state data, it MUST send the same lock-cookie value back to the state server. This occurs when the client releases its lock with a [ReleaseExclusive_Request](#Section_2.2.5.7) message.

If the server responds with a response-locked message, as specified in section 2.2.5.4, the client MAY retain the lock-cookie, [lock-age](#Section_2.2.3.10), and [lock-date](#Section_2.2.3.8) values for use with custom concurrency handling.<15>

If the server responds with either a response-bad-request or a response-not-found message, as specified in section 2.2.5.4, the client MAY surface some type of error back to the client's caller.<16>

<a id="Section_3.2.5.3"></a>
#### 3.2.5.3 Saving Session Data with a Set Request

When a client needs to store session data in a state server, it makes a request to the state server by using the message format that is specified in section [2.2.5.5](#Section_2.2.5.5).

If the client needs to perform custom initialization tasks on the [**session state**](#gt_session-state) data during a subsequent [Get_Request](#Section_2.2.5.1) or [GetExclusive_Request](#Section_2.2.5.3), the client MUST set the extra-flags field to "1".

If this is the first time that the session state data is being stored for the [unique identifier](#Section_2.2.3.13) that is contained in the combination of [application-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.1), [appdomain-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.2), and [session-identifier](#Section_2.2.3.3), the client MUST generate a [lock-cookie](#Section_2.2.3.9) that conforms to the format that is specified in section 2.2.3.9. However the lock-cookie will be ignored by the state server the first time session state data is being stored for a unique identifier.

If the session state data already exists for the unique identifier, and the session state data is being updated with a Set_Request message, the client MUST send the lock-cookie that it originally obtained from a previous GetExclusive_Request message.

The value of the **timeout** field in the Set_Request message is implementation-dependent.<17>

If the server responds with either a response-bad-request or a response-locked, as specified in section [2.2.5.6](#Section_2.2.5.6), the client MAY surface some type of error back to the client's caller.<18>

<a id="Section_3.2.5.4"></a>
#### 3.2.5.4 Releasing an Exclusive Session State Lock

A client can acquire an exclusive lock on [**session state**](#gt_session-state) with a successful [GetExclusive_Request](#Section_2.2.5.3) message. The client obtains the [lock-cookie](#Section_2.2.3.9) value associated with a piece of locked session state from the response to a successful GetExclusive_Request message. Alternatively, a client can acquire the lock-cookie value of a locked piece of session state from failed calls to GetExclusive_Request or [Get_Request](#Section_2.2.5.1) where a response-locked message was returned.

A client requests the release of the lock on a piece of session state data by using a [ReleaseExclusive_Request](#Section_2.2.5.7) message.

If the server responds with a response-bad-request, response-locked, or a response-not-found message, as specified in section [2.2.5.8](#Section_2.2.5.8), the client MAY surface some type of error back to the client's caller.<19>

<a id="Section_3.2.5.5"></a>
#### 3.2.5.5 Removing Session State

A client can acquire an exclusive lock on [**session state**](#gt_session-state) with a successful [GetExclusive_Request](#Section_2.2.5.3) message. The client obtains a [lock-cookie](#Section_2.2.3.9) value that is associated with a piece of locked session state from the response to a successful GetExclusive_Request message. Although a client can obtain a lock-cookie value from failed attempts to get session state, a client MUST only send a [Remove_Request](#Section_2.2.5.9) message if the client was able to successfully obtain an exclusive lock through a previous GetExclusive_Request or [Set_Request](#Section_2.2.5.5) operation.

A client sends a Remove_Request message to request that a specific set of session data be removed from the state server.

If the server responds with a response-bad-request, or response-locked as specified in section [2.2.5.10](#Section_2.2.5.10), the client MAY surface some type of error back to the client's caller.<20>

<a id="Section_3.2.5.6"></a>
#### 3.2.5.6 Resetting Session State Time-out

A client can send a [ResetTimeout_Request](#Section_2.2.5.11) message to request that a state server refresh the time-out for a specific piece of session data.

If the server responds with a response-not-found message, as specified in section [2.2.5.12](#Section_2.2.5.12), the client MAY surface some type of error back to the client's caller.<21>
