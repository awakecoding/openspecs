# 1 Introduction

The Encrypting File System Remote (EFSRPC) Protocol is used for performing maintenance and management operations on encrypted data that is stored remotely and accessed over a network. It is used in Windows to manage [**files**](#gt_file) that reside on remote file servers and are encrypted using the [**Encrypting File System (EFS)**](#gt_encrypting-file-system-efs).

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_access-control-list-acl"></a>
**access control list (ACL)**: A list of access control entries (ACEs) that collectively describe the security rules for authorizing access to some resource; for example, an object or set of objects.

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) as its primary access protocol. Active Directory stores information about a variety of objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md). Active Directory is either deployed as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), which are both described in [MS-ADOD](#Section_1.3): Active Directory Protocols Overview.

<a id="gt_advanced-encryption-standard-aes"></a>
**Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**: A block cipher that supersedes the Data Encryption Standard (DES). AES can be used to protect electronic data. The AES algorithm can be used to encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) information. Encryption converts data to an unintelligible form called ciphertext; decrypting the ciphertext converts the data back into its original form, called [**plaintext**](#gt_plaintext). AES is used in symmetric-key cryptography, meaning that the same [**key**](#gt_key) is used for the encryption and decryption operations. It is also a block cipher, meaning that it operates on fixed-size blocks of plaintext and ciphertext, and requires the size of the plaintext as well as the ciphertext to be an exact multiple of this block size. AES is also known as the Rijndael symmetric encryption algorithm [[FIPS197]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89870).

<a id="gt_binary-large-object-blob"></a>
**binary large object (BLOB)**: A collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database.

<a id="gt_binding"></a>
**binding**: The string representation of the protocol sequence, NetworkAddress, and optionally the [**endpoint**](#gt_endpoint). Also referred to as "string binding". For more information, see [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) section "String Bindings".

<a id="gt_certificate"></a>
**certificate**: A certificate is a collection of attributes and extensions that can be stored persistently. The set of attributes in a certificate can vary depending on the intended usage of the certificate. A certificate securely binds a public key to the entity that holds the corresponding private key. A certificate is commonly used for authentication and secure exchange of information on open networks, such as the Internet, extranets, and intranets. Certificates are digitally signed by the issuing [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) and can be issued for a user, a computer, or a service. The most widely accepted format for certificates is defined by the ITU-T X.509 version 3 international standards. For more information about attributes and extensions, see [[RFC3280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90414) and [[X509]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90590) sections 7 and 8.

<a id="gt_certificate-template"></a>
**certificate template**: A list of attributes that define a blueprint for creating an [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificate**](#gt_certificate). It is often referred to in non-Microsoft documentation as a "certificate profile". A [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template) is used to define the content and purpose of a digital certificate, including issuance requirements (certificate policies), implemented [**X.509**](#gt_x509) extensions such as application policies, key usage, or extended key usage as specified in [X509], and enrollment permissions. Enrollment permissions define the rules by which a [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) will issue or deny certificate requests. In Windows environments, [**certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template) are stored as objects in the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) and used by Microsoft enterprise [**CAs**](#gt_certification-authority-ca).

<a id="gt_certification-authority-ca"></a>
**certification authority (CA)**: A third party that issues [**public key**](#gt_public-key) [**certificates**](#gt_certificate). Certificates serve to bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide whether to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust is to be transitive. For more information, see [RFC3280].

<a id="gt_data-decryption-field-ddf"></a>
**Data Decryption Field (DDF)**: The portion of the EFSRPC Metadata that contains information that enables authorized users to decrypt the [**file**](#gt_file).

<a id="gt_data-recovery-agent-dra"></a>
**data recovery agent (DRA)**: A logical entity corresponding to an asymmetric key pair, which is configured as part of [**Encrypting File System (EFS)**](#gt_encrypting-file-system-efs) administrative policy by an administrator. Whenever an [**EFS**](#gt_encrypting-file-system-efs) file is created or modified, it is also automatically configured to give authorized access to all [**DRAs**](#gt_data-recovery-agent-dra) in effect at that time.

<a id="gt_data-recovery-field-drf"></a>
**data recovery field (DRF)**: The portion of the EFSRPC Metadata that contains information that enables authorized [**DRAs**](#gt_data-recovery-agent-dra) to decrypt the [**file**](#gt_file).

<a id="gt_domain"></a>
**domain**: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a [**domain controller (DC)**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) service. The domain controller provides authentication of members, creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD](../MS-AUTHSOD/MS-AUTHSOD.md) section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

<a id="gt_domain-controller-dc"></a>
**domain controller (DC)**: The service, running on a server, that implements [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory), or the server hosting this service. The service hosts the data store for objects and interoperates with other [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) to ensure that a local change to an object replicates correctly across all [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc). When [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is operating as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), the [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) contains full NC replicas of the configuration naming context (config NC), schema naming context (schema NC), and one of the domain NCs in its forest. If the AD DS [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) is a global catalog server (GC server), it contains partial NC replicas of the remaining domain NCs in its forest. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5.2 and [MS-ADTS]. When [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is operating as Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), several AD LDS [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) can run on one server. When [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is operating as AD DS, only one AD DS [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) can run on one server. However, several AD LDS [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) can coexist with one AD DS [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) on one server. The AD LDS [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) contains full NC replicas of the config NC and the schema NC in its forest. The domain controller is the server side of Authentication Protocol Domain Support [MS-APDS](../MS-APDS/MS-APDS.md).

<a id="gt_efsrpc-metadata"></a>
**EFSRPC Metadata**: The additional data stored with an encrypted [**file**](#gt_file) to enable authorized users to access the data in the [**file**](#gt_file). The format of this metadata is implementation-dependent. The EFSRPC Metadata general requirements are specified in detail in section 2.2.2 and the Windows format is specified in associated endnotes in Appendix B of this specification.

<a id="gt_efsrpc-raw-data-format"></a>
**EFSRPC Raw Data Format**: The data format used by the EFSRPC raw methods to marshal the contents and metadata of an encrypted [**file**](#gt_file) into a single-bit [**stream**](#gt_stream). It is specified in section 2.2.3.

<a id="gt_encrypting-file-system-efs"></a>
**Encrypting File System (EFS)**: The name for the encryption capability of the [**NTFS**](#gt_nt-file-system-ntfs) file system. When a file is encrypted using [**EFS**](#gt_encrypting-file-system-efs), a symmetric key known as the file encryption key (FEK) is generated and the contents of the file are encrypted with the FEK. For each user or [**data recovery agent (DRA)**](#gt_data-recovery-agent-dra) that is authorized to access the file, a copy of the FEK is encrypted with that user's or [**DRA's**](#gt_data-recovery-agent-dra) [**public key**](#gt_public-key) and is stored in the file's metadata. For more information about [**EFS**](#gt_encrypting-file-system-efs), see [[MSFT-EFS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90185).

<a id="gt_endpoint"></a>
**endpoint**: A network-specific address of a remote procedure call (RPC) server process for remote procedure calls. The actual name and type of the endpoint depends on the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol sequence that is being used. For example, for RPC over TCP (RPC Protocol Sequence ncacn_ip_tcp), an endpoint might be TCP port 1025. For RPC over Server Message Block (RPC Protocol Sequence ncacn_np), an endpoint might be the name of a [**named pipe**](#gt_named-pipe). For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_file"></a>
**file**: A unit of data in the [**file system**](#gt_file-system). An encrypted file consists of encrypted data along with the metadata required for a user to decrypt the file. The file and its metadata are protected using [**public key**](#gt_public-key) cryptography such that an authorized user's [**private key**](#gt_private-key) is required to decrypt the file.

<a id="gt_file-encryption-key-fek"></a>
**File Encryption Key (FEK)**: The symmetric key that is used to encrypt the data in an EFS-protected [**file**](#gt_file). The FEK is further encrypted and stored in the [**file**](#gt_file) metadata such that only authorized users can access it.

<a id="gt_file-system"></a>
**file system**: A system that enables applications to store and retrieve [**files**](#gt_file) on storage devices. Files are placed in a hierarchical structure. The file system specifies naming conventions for files and the format for specifying the path to a file in the tree structure. Each file system consists of one or more drivers and DLLs that define the data formats and features of the file system. File systems can exist on the following storage devices: diskettes, hard disks, jukeboxes, removable optical disks, and tape backup units.

<a id="gt_folder"></a>
**folder**: A container for [**files**](#gt_file) and other folders. A folder can be encrypted. The semantics of encrypting a folder are implementation-dependent. In the Windows implementation, encrypting a folder does not directly cause any data to be encrypted. Encrypting a folder in Windows has the following consequences of EFSRPC Metadata is created and stored with the folder and an [**NTFS**](#gt_nt-file-system-ntfs) attribute is set on the folder to signify that it is encrypted. NTFS checks this attribute when any new files or folders are created in the folder. NTFS will automatically encrypt any files or folders created within a folder that has this attribute set.

<a id="gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn"></a>
**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**: An unambiguous domain name that gives an absolute location in the Domain Name System's (DNS) hierarchy tree, as defined in [[RFC1035]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90264) section 3.1 and [[RFC2181]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=127732) section 11.

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with [**universally unique identifier (UUID)**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [C706] have to be used for generating the GUID. See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_kerberos-constrained-delegation"></a>
**Kerberos constrained delegation**: A form of authentication delegation in which Kerberos can be used to impersonate users that send requests for certain services, as opposed to all services.

<a id="gt_key"></a>
**key**: In cryptography, a generic term used to refer to cryptographic data that is used to initialize a cryptographic algorithm. [**Keys**](#gt_key) are also sometimes referred to as keying material.

<a id="gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap"></a>
**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**: The primary access protocol for [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory). Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an industry-standard protocol, established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which allows users to query and update information in a directory service (DS), as described in [MS-ADTS]. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol can be either version 2 [[RFC1777]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90290) or version 3 [[RFC3377]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91337).

<a id="gt_named-pipe"></a>
**named pipe**: A named, one-way, or duplex pipe for communication between a pipe server and one or more pipe clients.

<a id="gt_new-technology-file-system-ntfs"></a>
**New Technology File System (NTFS)**: The native [**file system**](#gt_file-system) of Windows 2000 operating system, Windows XP operating system, Windows Vista operating system, Windows 7 operating system, and Windows 8 operating system. Within this document, this term is occasionally used to refer to the operating system subsystem that implements NTFS support. For more information, see [[MSFT-NTFS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90200).

<a id="gt_nt-file-system-ntfs"></a>
**NT file system (NTFS)**: A proprietary Microsoft file system. For more information, see [MSFT-NTFS].

<a id="gt_opnum"></a>
**opnum**: An operation number or numeric identifier that is used to identify a specific [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) method or a method in an interface. For more information, see [C706] section 12.5.2.12 or [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

<a id="gt_plaintext"></a>
**plaintext**: In cryptography, ordinary readable text before it is encrypted into ciphertext, or after it has been decrypted.

<a id="gt_private-key"></a>
**private key**: One of a pair of keys used in public-key cryptography. The private key is kept secret and is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted with the corresponding public key. For an introduction to this concept, see [[CRYPTO]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89841) section 1.8 and [[IEEE1363]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89899) section 3.1.

<a id="gt_public-key"></a>
**public key**: One of a pair of keys used in public-key cryptography. The public key is distributed freely and published as part of a digital certificate. For an introduction to this concept, see [CRYPTO] section 1.8 and [IEEE1363] section 3.1.

<a id="gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc"></a>
**remote procedure call (RPC)**: A communication protocol used primarily between client and server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message). For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa"></a>
**Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)**: A system for public key cryptography. [**RSA**](#gt_rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa) is specified in [[RFC8017]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2164409).

<a id="gt_rpc-protocol-sequence"></a>
**RPC protocol sequence**: A character string that represents a valid combination of a [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol, a network layer protocol, and a transport layer protocol, as described in [C706] and [MS-RPCE].

<a id="gt_rpc-transport"></a>
**RPC transport**: The underlying network services used by the remote procedure call (RPC) runtime for communications between network nodes. For more information, see [C706] section 2.

<a id="gt_security-context"></a>
**security context**: An abstract data structure that contains authorization information for a particular security principal in the form of a Token/Authorization Context (see [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.5.2). A server uses the authorization information in a [**security context**](#gt_security-context) to check access to requested resources. A [**security context**](#gt_security-context) also contains a [**key**](#gt_key) identifier that associates mutually established cryptographic [**keys**](#gt_key), along with other information needed to perform secure communication with another security principal.

<a id="gt_security-identifier-sid"></a>
**security identifier (SID)**: An identifier for security principals that is used to identify an account or a group. Conceptually, the [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is composed of an account authority portion (typically a [**domain**](#gt_domain)) and a smaller integer representing an identity relative to the account authority, termed the relative identifier (RID). The [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) format is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2; a string representation of [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2 and [MS-AZOD](../MS-AZOD/MS-AZOD.md) section 1.1.1.2.

<a id="gt_security-support-provider-interface-sspi"></a>
**Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI)**: An API that allows connected applications to call one of several security providers to establish authenticated connections and to exchange data securely over those connections. It is equivalent to Generic Security Services (GSS)-API, and the two are on-the-wire compatible.

<a id="gt_server"></a>
**server**: A computer on which the [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) server is executing.

<a id="gt_server-message-block-smb"></a>
**Server Message Block (SMB)**: A protocol that is used to request file and print services from server systems over a network. The SMB protocol extends the CIFS protocol with additional security, file, and disk management support. For more information, see [[CIFS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109334) and [MS-SMB](../MS-SMB/MS-SMB.md).

<a id="gt_sparse-file"></a>
**sparse file**: A [**file**](#gt_file) containing large sections of data composed only of zeros. This file is marked as a sparse file in the [**file system**](#gt_file-system), which saves disk space by only allocating as many ranges on disk as are required to completely reconstruct the non-zero data. When an attempt is made to read in the nonallocated portions of the [**file**](#gt_file) (also known as holes), the [**file system**](#gt_file-system) automatically returns zeros to the caller.

<a id="gt_stream"></a>
**stream**: A sequence of bytes written to a file on the target [**file system**](#gt_file-system). Every file stored on a volume that uses the file system contains at least one stream, which is normally used to store the primary contents of the file. Additional streams within the file can be used to store file attributes, application parameters, or other information specific to that file. Every file has a default data stream, which is unnamed by default. That data stream, and any other data stream associated with a file, can optionally be named.

<a id="gt_uncpath"></a>
**UncPath**: The location of a file in a network of computers, as specified in Universal Naming Convention (UNC) syntax.

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world. The [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) standard [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16 BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as [**globally unique identifiers (GUIDs)**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [RFC4122] or [C706] has to be used for generating the UUID.

<a id="gt_valid-data-length-vdl"></a>
**valid data length (VDL)**: In [**NTFS**](#gt_nt-file-system-ntfs), there are two important concepts of [**file**](#gt_file) length: the end-of-file (EOF) marker and the valid data length (VDL). The EOF indicates the actual length of the [**file**](#gt_file). The VDL identifies the length of valid data on disk. Any reads between VDL and EOF automatically return zeros.

<a id="gt_well-known-endpoint"></a>
**well-known endpoint**: A preassigned, network-specific, stable address for a particular client/server instance. For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_x509"></a>

## 1.3 Overview

The Encrypting File System Remote Protocol (hereafter referred to as EFSRPC) is a [**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interface that is used to manage data objects stored in an encrypted form. The objective of encrypting data in this fashion is to enforce access control policies and to provide confidentiality from unauthorized users.

EFSRPC is implemented in Windows to provide remote management for [**files**](#gt_file) encrypted by the [**Encrypting File System (EFS)**](#gt_encrypting-file-system-efs). EFS is the ability of the [**New Technology File System (NTFS)**](#gt_new-technology-file-system-ntfs) file system to encrypt files on disk in a manner that is transparent to the user. For more information on EFS, see [[MSFT-EFS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90185). For more information about [**NTFS**](#gt_nt-file-system-ntfs), see [[MSFT-NTFS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90200).

EFSRPC does not address how data is encrypted, how the encrypted data is stored, or how it is accessed for routine operations such as reading, writing, creating, and deleting. All these actions are specific to the server implementation. On Windows, NTFS provides the storage mechanism (the file is the unit of storage) and the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol provides remote access to such files. For more information about [**SMB**](#gt_server-message-block-smb), see [MS-SMB](../MS-SMB/MS-SMB.md) and [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md).

EFSRPC models the underlying data encryption architecture using two basic constructs:

- A set of data objects, each of which is encrypted independently and can be managed independently.
- A set of access control subjects, each of which is represented by a key pair generated by a [**public key**](#gt_public-key) cryptographic algorithm. The public key of this key pair is embedded in a [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) and can be widely distributed in that form. The corresponding [**private key**](#gt_private-key) is held solely by the user or users who represent that subject. Thus, a given access control subject can correspond to one or more users, and a given user can possess the private keys for zero or more access control subjects. Access control subjects are further divided into two types:
- Unprivileged user subjects, which are used for routine data access by ordinary users of the system. For convenience, this specification refers to such subjects as user certificate.
- [**Data Recovery Agents (DRAs)**](#gt_data-recovery-agent-dra), which are controlled by system administrators. The storage system ensures that all active DRAs for the system are automatically authorized to access all encrypted objects on the system. If an unprivileged user loses the private key, an administrator can use a DRA's private key to recover the contents of encrypted objects.
EFSRPC also assumes that each encrypted object is associated with some security-related metadata, which contains information required for authorized users and DRAs to access the [**plaintext**](#gt_plaintext) of the object. This specification refers to this security-related metadata as the [EFSRPC Metadata](#Section_2.2.2).

EFSRPC does not specify how data is encrypted, stored, or accessed. It is possible to build a compliant EFSRPC implementation that uses a mechanism, such as [**access control lists (ACLs)**](#gt_access-control-list-acl), instead of encryption to control access to data objects. For the purposes of this specification, the term encrypted is used to indicate that a data object and its metadata can be successfully manipulated through the EFSRPC methods, with the exception of the [EfsRpcEncryptFileSrv](#Section_3.1.4.2.5) method, which converts data objects from an unencrypted state to an encrypted state.

Within the preceding model, EFSRPC provides various categories of management routines. The syntax of the individual methods and rules for how these methods are processed on the server are specified in section [3.1.4.2](#Section_3.1.4.2). The categories of management routines that EFSRPC provides are as follows:

- Requesting the server to convert objects from encrypted state to unencrypted state and vice versa.
- EfsRpcEncryptFileSrv (section 3.1.4.2.5)
- [EfsRpcDecryptFileSrv (section 3.1.4.2.6)](#Section_3.1.4.2.6)
- Creating, querying, and manipulating the EFSRPC Metadata. Clients use the following methods to query and change which user certificates can be used to decrypt an encrypted object. The set of user certificates with access to an object needs to be changed when the set of users with access to the object changes or when a user with access to the object changes the user certificate. The following methods can also be used to copy the access rights from one object to another; the [EfsRpcDuplicateEncryptionInfoFile](#Section_3.1.4.2.13) method is particularly well-suited for this purpose. Methods:
- [EfsRpcQueryUsersOnFile (section 3.1.4.2.7)](#Section_3.1.4.2.7)
- [EfsRpcQueryRecoveryAgents (section 3.1.4.2.8)](#Section_3.1.4.2.8)
- [EfsRpcRemoveUsersFromFile (section 3.1.4.2.9)](#Section_3.1.4.2.9)
- [EfsRpcAddUsersToFile (section 3.1.4.2.10)](#Section_3.1.4.2.14)
- [EfsRpcFileKeyInfo (section 3.1.4.2.12)](#Section_3.1.4.2.15)
- EfsRpcDuplicateEncryptionInfoFile (section 3.1.4.2.13)
- [EfsRpcAddUsersToFileEx (section 3.1.4.2.14)](#Section_3.1.4.2.14)
- [EfsRpcFileKeyInfoEx (section 3.1.4.2.15)](#Section_3.1.4.2.15)
- [EfsRpcGetEncryptedFileMetadata (section 3.1.4.2.16)](#Section_3.1.4.2.16)
- [EfsRpcSetEncryptedFileMetadata (section 3.1.4.2.17)](#Section_3.1.4.2.17)
- Performing backup of encrypted objects in ciphertext form along with their EFSRPC Metadata, and restoring encrypted objects from such backups. Depending on the implementation of these methods, the backups that are created can expose the implementation-specific EFSRPC Metadata format to the client. The Windows implementation of these methods exposes the Windows EFSRPC Metadata format; however, Windows applications do not manipulate this information. The following methods are suitable for secure content archival or transferring encrypted data securely between servers of the same implementation because they do not require decrypting the data. Methods:
- [EfsRpcOpenFileRaw (section 3.1.4.2.1)](#Section_3.1.4.2.1)
- [EfsRpcReadFileRaw (section 3.1.4.2.2)](#Section_3.1.4.2.2)
- [EfsRpcWriteFileRaw (section 3.1.4.2.3)](#Section_3.1.4.2.3)
- [EfsRpcCloseRaw (section 3.1.4.2.4)](#Section_3.1.4.2.4)
- Controlling the server's encryption subsystem. Methods:
- [EfsRpcFlushEfsCache (section 3.1.4.2.18)](#Section_3.1.4.2.18)
Most of the EFSRPC routines are stateless and can be called in any order. When one of these routines is called, the message exchange is as follows.

![Message exchange for stateless routines](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Message exchange for stateless routines

There are two routines in EFSRPC that are an exception to the stateless nature of the protocol. Several methods, collectively known as the EFSRPC raw methods, are an exception and need to be called in a specific order. This includes the EfsRpcOpenFileRaw, EfsRpcReadFileRaw, EfsRpcWriteFileRaw, and EfsRpcCloseRaw methods. The following two sequences are permissible.

## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Encrypting File System Remote Protocol is built on the Microsoft [**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interface (as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md)). EFSRPC uses the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol [MS-SMB](../MS-SMB/MS-SMB.md) [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) as its [**RPC transport**](#gt_rpc-transport). Specifically, it uses [**named pipes**](#gt_named-pipe) over [**SMB**](#gt_server-message-block-smb) (that is, [**RPC protocol sequence**](#gt_rpc-protocol-sequence) ncacn_np) as its transport mechanism. Either version 1 or version 2 of SMB can be used. The client has to connect to the server over SMB and negotiate a version of SMB before it can access the named pipe that is the RPC [**endpoint**](#gt_endpoint) on the server.

Windows also supports the storage of encrypted [**files**](#gt_file) via WebDAV [MS-WDV](../MS-WDV/MS-WDV.md). However, this feature does not use EFSRPC. This feature does not alter the WebDAV Protocol. Windows clients store encrypted files on WebDAV servers in the [**EFSRPC Raw Data Format**](#gt_efsrpc-raw-data-format), but the Windows WebDAV client performs all encryption and decryption operations locally. It also performs the local operations necessary to transform the file to and from the EFSRPC Raw Data Format during upload and download respectively. For more information, see [[MSFT-XPUEFS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90713).

This specification provides an interface (see section [3.1.4.1](#Section_3.1.1.1)) for applications to request a user certificate. This interface uses methods outlined in [MS-WCCE](../MS-WCCE/MS-WCCE.md) to enroll for a certificate and key.

![Protocol relationships](media/image4.png)

Figure 4: Protocol relationships

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

To use EFSRPC with a remote server, the client is required to possess valid credentials recognized by the server and be able to pass authentication and authorization checks for access to the encrypted data on the server. If secure operation is desired, the server is required to register an appropriate server principal name/authentication service pair that supports a protection level that provides packet integrity. Additionally, the client needs to be configured to associate the appropriate server principal name and authentication, and authorization and protection level with its [**binding**](#gt_binding), when connecting to the server.<1>

The User-Certificate Binding interface described in section [3.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.1.1) stores user keys protected to the user credentials and requires that the EFSRPC server be joined to the [**domain**](#gt_domain) and configured for Kerberos delegation.<2> Alternatively, the server can be configured for [**Kerberos constrained delegation**](#gt_kerberos-constrained-delegation) (as specified in [MS-SFU](../MS-SFU/MS-SFU.md)) for only the services used for user key storage.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is appropriate for remotely managing encrypted data objects on a server. It is used by Windows clients to manage EFSRPC-protected [**files**](#gt_file) on remote file servers using either version 1 or version 2 of the SMB Protocol. It does not specify any particular data protection mechanism.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas.

**Supported Transports:** This protocol uses [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) for communication. It uses [**named pipes**](#gt_named-pipe) as the transport mechanism, as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).

**Protocol Versions:** The RPC runtime negotiates the version of the EFSRPC interface, as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824). The only supported version of this protocol is 1.0, as specified in section [3.1.4.2](#Section_3.1.4.2).

**Security and Authentication Methods:** EFSRPC does not specify any methods for authenticating access to the objects it operates on. The underlying data encryption and storage system can implement any authentication mechanism. In Windows, such authentication is provided by [**SMB**](#gt_server-message-block-smb), as specified in [MS-SMB](../MS-SMB/MS-SMB.md) and [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md). An EFSRPC server can register a server principal name/authentication service pair to enable secure RPC communications, and a client can choose to associate this security service with its [**binding**](#gt_binding) when connecting to the server, as specified in section [3](#Section_1.3).

**Capability Negotiation:** Implicit negotiation of RPC security mechanisms can be performed through the security-related APIs specified in [C706] Chapter 13. The security mechanisms negotiated by Windows clients and servers are as specified in section 2.1.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

EFSRPC does not include any vendor-extensible fields.

This protocol uses Win32 error codes. These values are taken from the Windows error number space as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.2. Vendors SHOULD reuse those values with their indicated meaning. Using any other value runs the risk of a collision in the future.

## 2.1 Transport

The client and [**server**](#gt_server) MUST communicate over [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc), using [**named pipes**](#gt_named-pipe) over the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol. The [**SMB**](#gt_server-message-block-smb) version, capabilities, and authentication used for this connection are negotiated between the client and server when the connection is established, as specified in [MS-SMB](../MS-SMB/MS-SMB.md) and [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md).

EFSRPC messages to remote servers SHOULD be sent using the [**well-known endpoint**](#gt_well-known-endpoint) \pipe\efsrpc. Remote servers MAY respond to EFSRPC messages sent using the well-known endpoint \pipe\lsarpc. When connecting to \pipe\efsrpc, the server interface is identified by [**UUID**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid) [df1941c5-fe89-4e79-bf10-463657acf44d], version 1.0. When connecting to \pipe\lsarpc, the server interface is identified by UUID [c681d488-d850-11d0-8c52-00c04fd90f7e], version 1.0.<4>

The EFSRPC client MUST use explicit [**binding**](#gt_binding) to create the RPC binding handle used to connect to the server, unless otherwise specified in section [3.1.4.2](#Section_3.1.4.2).

A server SHOULD<5> register one or more server principal name/authentication service pairs that provide a protection level that includes packet integrity. A client SHOULD attempt to associate suitable security information with its binding for the EFSRPC methods. For [EfsRpcOpenFileRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.1), clients SHOULD set the security options explicitly as noted in section [3](#Section_1.3). For all other EFSRPC methods, clients SHOULD use default values for the binding security information as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.3.2.3.1.

## 2.2 Common Data Types

This section specifies the syntax of EFSRPC data types. In addition to the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) base types and definitions specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md), the additional data types described in the following sections are defined in the Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL) specification for this RPC interface. This protocol MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to support the NDR20 transfer syntax only, as specified in [C706] Part 4.

This specification uses GUID structures as specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.3.4.2.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 EFSRPC Identifiers

An EFSRPC identifier is used to uniquely refer to an encrypted data object on a remote [**server**](#gt_server). The format of the identifier used is implementation-specific. It MUST be represented as a null-terminated [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) string in UTF-16 encoding. EFSRPC servers SHOULD use [**UncPaths**](#gt_uncpath) for EFSRPC identifiers. The server MUST return an error if it is passed an identifier that violates the syntactic rules imposed by its implementation.<6>

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 EFSRPC Metadata

The EFSRPC Metadata is attached to an encrypted object and contains information required to decrypt it. The EFSRPC Metadata is used implicitly by the EFSRPC raw methods, because it forms part of the [EFSRPC Raw Data Format](#Section_2.2.3).

The structure of the EFSRPC Metadata is implementation dependent. An EFSRPC server SHOULD return an error if EFSRPC Metadata is passed to it in an unsupported format. An EFSRPC client SHOULD NOT parse the EFSRPC Metadata, and SHOULD NOT rely on it being in any particular format.

The EFSRPC Metadata SHOULD be represented on the server as follows.

# 3 Protocol Details

This section specifies the behavior of the EFSRPC server in more detail. The client side of this protocol is simply a pass-through. There are no additional timers or other state requirements on the client side of this protocol. Calls made by the higher-layer protocol or application are passed directly to the transport, and the results returned by the transport are passed directly back to the higher-layer protocol or application. The client SHOULD<32> attempt to associate the use of suitable [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) security mechanisms with its [**binding**](#gt_binding) when making the [EfsRpcOpenFileRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.1) call, so that the data transfer is protected from man-in-the-middle attacks.

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Server Details

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to explain how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

EFSRPC assumes the existence of an underlying storage encryption system on the server that defines the following conceptual entities:

- A set of data objects, each of which is encrypted independently and can be managed independently.
- A set of access control subjects, each of which is represented by a [**key**](#gt_key) pair generated by a [**public key**](#gt_public-key) cryptographic algorithm. The public key of this key pair is embedded in a [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) and can be widely distributed in that form. The [**private key**](#gt_private-key) is known only to the user or users who represent that access control subject. Access control subjects are of two types:
- Unprivileged user subjects are used by ordinary users to perform routine operations, including managing [**files**](#gt_file) with the EFSRPC methods. For convenience, this specification refers to such subjects as user certificates.
- [**Data Recovery Agents (DRAs)**](#gt_data-recovery-agent-dra) are used by system administrators to perform data recovery tasks. The storage system ensures that all active DRAs for the system are automatically authorized to access all encrypted objects on the system. If a user loses his or her private key, an administrator can use the DRA private key to recover the contents of their encrypted objects.
- As an alternative to user certificates, access control subjects can be represented by DPAPI-NG descriptors or RMS.
The storage encryption system is also assumed to provide certain primitive operations:

- Methods for reading, writing, creating, and destroying encrypted objects. The methods for reading and writing objects must ensure that only a user who possesses the private key corresponding to an authorized user certificate or DRA for that object can perform these operations.
- An operation to convert an existing unencrypted object to encrypted form. This causes the original object to be replaced by its ciphertext, along with some metadata that is essential for decrypting the ciphertext.
- An operation to convert an existing encrypted object to unencrypted form. This replaces the ciphertext of the object with the [**plaintext**](#gt_plaintext), and destroys the encryption-related metadata.
- An operation to extract the [EFSRPC Metadata](#Section_2.2.2) of an existing encrypted object without modifying the object itself in any other way.
- Operations to parse and manipulate the metadata obtained in this way, and in particular to add or remove access to specific user certificates for users who pass certain authorization checks.
- An operation to replace the EFSRPC Metadata of an existing encrypted object without modifying the object in any way, which ensures that a user cannot modify the set of DRAs having access to the object.
- An operation to read the ciphertext and metadata of an encrypted object without decrypting it.
- An operation to create an encrypted object directly by writing its ciphertext and metadata to the store.
In addition, the following are assumed to be accessible to the server:

- A logical credential store for each user of the system. Each user's credential store contains the private keys to which that user has access. The credential store also provides a method of locating the private key associated with a given certificate, RMS template GUID, or DPAPI-NG protection rule.<33> The server is assumed to have some implementation-specific method of maintaining this credential store.
- A logical store that contains certificates belonging to various users of the system and provides a means of retrieving individual certificates from this set.
- A logical cache for each user that contains all the sensitive information associated with that user necessary for performing EFSRPC operations on behalf of the user.
- A method of ascertaining the DRAs desired by an appropriate administrator at any time.
<a id="Section_3.1.1.1"></a>
#### 3.1.1.1 User-Certificate Binding

[Applications requesting a user-certificate binding (section 3.1.4.1)](#Section_3.1.1.1) must supply a [**security context**](#gt_security-context) for the user. The security context is used in two ways: to maintain per-user state based on the unique principal [**security identifier (SID)**](#gt_security-identifier-sid), and to authenticate the user during certificate enrollment.

The server maintains a persistent per-user collection of zero or more certificates, and corresponding private keys. The format of the certificates within this collection MUST conform to that specified in [[RFC5280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131034). In addition, this collection MUST contain only certificates and private keys that are valid for use by the EFS subsystem on the client. This collection is referred to as **EFS User Certificates**, and is used by higher-layer protocols to perform encryption and decryption of EFS objects.

The **EFS User Certificates** collection on the client contains at most one certificate that is marked as the **EFS Current Key** for the user. The **EFS User Certificates** collection and the **EFS Current Key** can be populated by various implementation-specific methods.

The server defines a number of parameters for the certificate enrollment request. These parameters are persistent across reboot, with no intermediate or volatile form. The parameters can be updated by external entities (that is, other products). The parameters are as follows:

**RequireV3Template (Public):** A **Boolean** indicating whether to restrict the list of allowed [**certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template) to version 3 and higher. The server MUST initialize this to the default value of False.

**DisallowV3Template (Public):** A **Boolean** indicating whether to restrict the list of allowed certificate templates to version 2 and lower. The server MUST initialize this to the default value of False.

**RequireSmartCard (Public):** A **Boolean** indicating whether to require that the resultant private key from the enrollment operation be stored on a smart card device. The server MUST initialize this to the default value of False.

**TemplateName (Public):** A variable length, null-terminated Unicode string indicating the name of the certificate template to use in the enrollment operation. The server MUST initialize this to the default value of "EFS".

**Note** The abstract interface notation "(Public)" indicates that the Abstract Data Model element can be directly accessed from outside of this protocol.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.2"></a>
#### 3.1.1.2 EFSRPC Server Control

The server has a parameter that indicates whether it is disabled. This parameter is kept in memory and not persisted across reboots. The parameter can be updated by external entities (that is, other products). The parameter is as follows:

**EfsDisabled (Public):** A **Boolean** indicating whether the EFSRPC interface is to reject incoming requests and return an error. The server MUST initialize this to the default value of false.

**Note** The abstract interface notation "**(Public)**" indicates that the Abstract Data Model element can be directly accessed from outside this protocol.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

This protocol does not specify any timers.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

After the server is initialized, the [**well-known endpoint**](#gt_well-known-endpoint) \pipe\lsarpc or \pipe\efsrpc MUST be available to remote callers, and the EFSRPC server MUST be available to service requests.<34> The [**file system**](#gt_file-system) and transport underlying this [**named pipe**](#gt_named-pipe) MUST be fully initialized.

When the server is initialized, it SHOULD<35> register one or more server principal name/authentication service pairs to enable clients to connect over secure [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc).

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.1.4.1"></a>
#### 3.1.4.1 Application Requests for a User-Certificate Binding

An application (including implementations of the EFSRPC protocol) can request a binding between a user and an EFS certificate. The application MUST provide a [**security context**](#gt_security-context) for the user. Using this security context, the EFS Group Policy client performs the following processes to establish a binding between the user and a certificate.

- If the **EfsDisabled** field equals true, return ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED (specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md)) and do no further processing.
- Using the principal [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) from the security context as a key, retrieve a reference to the **EFS User Certificates** for the user. Also, retrieve the **EFS Current Key** from the **EFS User Certificates**, if one exists.
- If an **EFS Current Key** does not exist, attempt to enroll for a new certificate using the algorithm outlined in section [3.1.4.1.1](#Section_3.1.4.1.1).
- If the enrollment request is successful, add the new certificate and private key to the **EFS User Certificates** collection, and mark the new certificate as the **EFS Current Key** within the collection.
- If an **EFS Current Key** now exists, return it as the bound certificate.
- Otherwise, return an error.
<a id="Section_3.1.4.1.1"></a>
##### 3.1.4.1.1 EFS Certificate Enrollment Algorithm

This algorithm describes the process used to enroll for an EFS certificate, and is triggered by the higher-layer event described in section [3.1.4.1](#Section_3.1.1.1). In order for an EFS server to enroll for a certificate, the server MUST be a member of some [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) domain. The [**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) search and modify operations used by this algorithm are specified in sections 4.5 and 4.6 of [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325). Section 3.1.1.3 of [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) describes the profile of LDAP as implemented by the Active Directory domain controller (DC). All LDAP operations used in this algorithm are assumed to be performed against a [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) located as described in [MS-ADOD](#Section_1.3) section 2.7.7.3.1.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.1.1.1"></a>

- Initialize the **CAList** variable as specified in section [3.1.4.1.1.4.1](#Section_3.1.4.1.1.4.1).
- Create **Request** as specified in section [3.1.4.1.1.4.2](#Section_3.1.4.1.1.4.2).
- For each item in the **CAList**, attempt to submit the certificate request created in step 2.
- Use the [**FQDN**](#gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn) value to target a specific WCCE server [MS-WCCE](../MS-WCCE/MS-WCCE.md).
- Use the CA name as the *pwszAuthority* parameter of the ICertRequestD2::Request2() method.
Continue to process the items in the list until the request is successful or there are no more items in the list.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.1.1.4.1"></a>
Building a List of CAs that Support a Particular Template

The client performs the following steps to build a list of [**certificate authorities (CAs)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) supporting the template specified by the **TemplateName** input:

- Perform an LDAP search for the CA information (**pKIEnrollmentService**) objects (specified in [MS-WCCE](../MS-WCCE/MS-WCCE.md) section 2.2.2.11.2) under the following container:
"CN=Enrollment Services,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=…"

where "CN=Configuration,DC=…" is replaced with the value of the configurationNamingContext attribute (specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 3.1.1.3.2.1) of the **rootDSE** object.

- For each object in the search result:
- If the **ntSecurityDescriptor** attribute of the object does not have Enroll permission, or has Enroll permission denied (specified in [MS-CRTD](../MS-CRTD/MS-CRTD.md) section 2.5) for the user's security context, continue with the next object.
- If the **cACertificate** attribute contains a value equal to the **TemplateName** field, add a value pair to the **CAList** where the name is set to the value of the **cn** attribute, and **FQDN** is set to the value of the **dNSHostName** attribute.
<a id="Section_3.1.4.1.1.4.2"></a>

"CN=Certificate Templates,CN-Public Key Services, CN=Services, CN=Configuration,DC=…"

where "CN=Configuration,DC=…" is replaced with the value of the **configurationNamingContext** attribute (specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 3.1.1.3.2.1) of the **rootDSE** object. Restrict the search to objects that have **cn** attribute equal to the **TemplateName** field.

- If the **RequireV3Template** field equals True and the **msPKI-Template-Schema-Version** attribute value is less than 3, return an error.
- If the **DisallowV3Template** field equals True and the **msPKI-Template-Schema-Version** attribute value is greater than 2, return an error.
- Create a certificate request as specified in section 3.1.2 of [MS-WCCE](../MS-WCCE/MS-WCCE.md), setting the WCCE ADM by using the method in [MS-WCCE] section 3.1.2.6.1 with the following parameters:
- The **Parameters.Certificate.Template.*** parameters are initialized by the corresponding values from the objects retrieved in the first step above.
- The **Parameters.IsRenewalRequest** parameter is set to False.
- The **Parameters.CertificateToBeRenewed** parameter is set to nothing.
- The **Parameters.RACertificates** list parameter is empty.
- If the **Parameters.RequireSmartCard** parameter is True, the private key for the request created in the previous step MUST be stored on a smart card.

#### 3.1.4.2 EFSRPC Interface

This protocol MUST instruct the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) runtime to perform a strict NDR data consistency check at target level 6.0, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.

This protocol MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to support both NDR and NDR64 transfer syntaxes, in addition to the negotiation mechanism that determines which transfer syntax will be used, as described in [MS-RPCE] section 3.

This protocol MUST instruct the RPC runtime to reject a NULL unique or full pointer with a nonzero-conforming value, as defined in [MS-RPCE] section 3.

The [**server**](#gt_server) SHOULD use the RPC protocol to retrieve the identity of the caller, as described in [MS-RPCE] section 3.3.3.4.3, and to enforce appropriate security measures to ensure that the caller has required permissions to execute the following routines. If the caller does not have the required permissions to execute a specific method, the server SHOULD fail the method call with ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED (specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md)).

This subsection specifies the syntax of the methods specified by the EFSRPC protocol and how to receive each one. These calls are received at the [**well-known endpoint**](#gt_well-known-endpoint) of the [**named pipe**](#gt_named-pipe) \pipe\lsarpc or \pipe\efsrpc. The server interface for \pipe\lsarpc MUST be identified by [**UUID**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid) [c681d488-d850-11d0-8c52-00c04fd90f7e], version 1.0. The server interface for \pipe\efsrpc MUST be identified by UUID [df1941c5-fe89-4e79-bf10-463657acf44d], version 1.0.<36>

The following table specifies the [**opnum**](#gt_opnum) associated with each RPC method in this protocol. An EFSRPC server SHOULD support all of the methods specified in this table.<37><38>

| Opnum44NotUsedOnWire | Reserved for local use. Opnum: 44 |

In the previous table, the term "Reserved for local use" means that the client MUST NOT send the opnum, and the server behavior is undefined<39> because it does not affect interoperability. When a method marked as "Deprecated" is received, the server SHOULD ignore the parameters of the method and return a nonzero value.<40>

All methods in this protocol MUST return 0 on success, and a nonzero value on failure. Servers SHOULD use the values specified in [MS-ERREF] for all nonzero error codes. The client MUST treat all nonzero return values identically.

When the server receives a message from an EFSRPC client, it SHOULD first check the value of the **EfsDisabled** field. If it is True, the server SHOULD<41> return ERROR_EFS_DISABLED (specified in [MS-ERREF]) and perform no further processing. Otherwise, it SHOULD perform any necessary steps to read its configuration, validate its input parameters (such as any EFSRPC identifiers that refer to local data objects), authenticate the client, and perform any access checks prescribed by the implementation.

This protocol MUST indicate to the RPC runtime by way of the **strict_context_handle** attribute that it is to reject use of context handles created by a method of an RPC interface other than this one, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 3.

**Exceptions Thrown:** No exceptions are thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol, as specified in [MS-RPCE].

<a id="Section_3.1.4.2.1"></a>
##### 3.1.4.2.1 Receiving an EfsRpcOpenFileRaw Message (Opnum 0)

The EfsRpcOpenFileRaw method is used to open an encrypted object on the server for backup or restore. It allocates resources that MUST be released by calling the [EfsRpcCloseRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.4) method.<42>

long EfsRpcOpenFileRaw(

[in] handle_t binding_h,

[out] PEXIMPORT_CONTEXT_HANDLE* hContext,

[in, string] wchar_t* FileName,

[in] long Flags

);

**binding_h:** An explicit [**binding**](#gt_binding) handle created by the client. This is an RPC binding handle parameter, as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**hContext:** An implementation-specific context handle that is used in subsequent calls by the client to the [EfsRpcReadFileRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.2) method, [EfsRpcWriteFileRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.3) method, or EfsRpcCloseRaw method.

**FileName:** An EFSRPC identifier, as specified in section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1).

**Flags:** This MUST be set to some combination of the following values. All servers and clients MUST support the **CREATE_FOR_IMPORT** flag. Servers that implement a hierarchical encrypted store, such as the NTFS file system, SHOULD also support the **CREATE_FOR_DIR** flag. Servers SHOULD support the **OVERWRITE_HIDDEN** flag, and MAY interpret it in implementation-specific ways. A client MUST ensure that all the flags it does not support are set to zero. A server MUST ignore all flags it does not support. Flag values are specified in the following table.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| CREATE_FOR_IMPORT 0x00000001 | Open the object for writing (that is, restore). If this flag is not set, open the object for reading (that is, backup). |
| CREATE_FOR_DIR 0x00000002 | This flag is only intended for use in conjunction with the **CREATE_FOR_IMPORT** flag. It indicates that the object being restored is a container for other objects.<43> |
| OVERWRITE_HIDDEN 0x00000004 | This flag is only intended for use in conjunction with the **CREATE_FOR_IMPORT** flag. This flag indicates a request from the client for the server to overwrite an existing object even if the existing object is "hidden". The meaning of "hidden" is specific to the implementation of the data store, and this meaning does not affect protocol behavior. |
| EFS_DROP_ALTERNATE_STREAMS 0x00000010 | This flag indicates that content from any alternate data streams, if present and implemented by the storage system, will be ignored. |

**Return Values:** The server MUST return 0 if it successfully processes the message received from the client. The server MUST return a nonzero value if processing fails.

First, the server SHOULD perform any additional access checks prescribed by the implementation. If any of these checks fail, it MUST return a nonzero value.

EFSRPC servers SHOULD return an error unless at least one of the following conditions is true:

- The calling user has a [**private key**](#gt_private-key) that grants the user authorized access to the file.
- The **CREATE_FOR_IMPORT** flag is set, and the user has restore rights on the server.
- The **CREATE_FOR_IMPORT** flag is not set, and the user has backup rights on the server.
If the **CREATE_FOR_IMPORT** flag is set, the server MUST attempt to create an object with the given name and prepare it for writing data received in future EfsRpcWriteFileRaw calls. The server MUST return a nonzero value if this fails.

If the **CREATE_FOR_IMPORT** flag is not set, the server MUST attempt to locate the object requested and prepare it for reading data to be sent through future EfsRpcReadFileRaw calls. The server MUST return a nonzero value if it fails.

If the server supports the **CREATE_FOR_DIR** flag, and this flag is set:

- If the **CREATE_FOR_IMPORT** flag is not set:
- If the data object referred to by *FileName* exists on the server and is not a container for other objects, the server SHOULD return a nonzero value.
- Otherwise, the server SHOULD ignore the **CREATE_FOR_DIR** flag.
- If the **CREATE_FOR_IMPORT** flag is set, the server MUST attempt to create a container with the given name and prepare it for writing data received in future EfsRpcWriteFileRaw calls. The server MUST return a nonzero value if this fails.
If the server supports the **OVERWRITE_HIDDEN** flag, and this flag is set:

- If the **CREATE_FOR_IMPORT** flag is not set, the server SHOULD ignore this flag.
- If the **CREATE_FOR_IMPORT** flag is set, the server SHOULD overwrite an existing object even if the object is "hidden". The meaning of "hidden" is specific to the implementation of the data store, and this meaning does not affect protocol behavior.
The server MUST ignore any flags that it does not support.

On success, the server MUST create an appropriate context handle and return it to the client.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.2.2"></a>
##### 3.1.4.2.2 Receiving an EfsRpcReadFileRaw Message (Opnum 1)

The method EfsRpcReadFileRaw is used by a client to obtain marshaled data for an encrypted object from the server.

long EfsRpcReadFileRaw(

[in] PEXIMPORT_CONTEXT_HANDLE hContext,

[out] EFS_EXIM_PIPE* EfsOutPipe

);

**hContext:** A context handle returned by the [EfsRpcOpenFileRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.1) method, which MUST have been called without the CREATE_FOR_IMPORT flag.

**EfsOutPipe:** A pipe structure. The push procedure of this pipe will be called with the marshaled data. The structure of this marshaled data is specified in section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3).

**Return Values:** The server MUST return 0 if it successfully processes the message received from the client.

If called with a context handle that has not been obtained by calling the EfsRpcOpenFileRaw method without the CREATE_FOR_IMPORT flag set, the server SHOULD throw an RPC exception.

The server MUST read data from the object and write it to the pipe in EFSRPC Raw Data Format until all the data in the object has been written. When all the data in the object has been written, the server MUST flush the pipe by performing a 0-byte write to the pipe, and return 0 to the user to indicate success.

If an error is encountered during the read, the server MUST flush the pipe and SHOULD throw an RPC exception. The pipe MUST be flushed by performing a 0-byte write to the pipe.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.2.3"></a>
##### 3.1.4.2.3 Receiving an EfsRpcWriteFileRaw Message (Opnum 2)

The method EfsRpcWriteFileRaw is used to create an encrypted object on the server from the marshaled data provided by the client.

long EfsRpcWriteFileRaw(

[in] PEXIMPORT_CONTEXT_HANDLE hContext,

[in] EFS_EXIM_PIPE* EfsInPipe

);

**hContext:** A context handle returned by the [EfsRpcOpenFileRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.1) method, which MUST have been called with the CREATE_FOR_IMPORT flag.

**EfsInPipe:** A pipe structure. The pull procedure of this pipe is expected to provide the marshaled data. The structure of this marshaled data is specified in section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3).

**Return Values:** The server MUST return 0 if it successfully processes the message received from the client.

If called with a context handle that has not been obtained by calling EfsRpcOpenFileRaw with the CREATE_FOR_IMPORT flag set, the server MUST abort the operation. In this case, it SHOULD throw an RPC exception.

The server MUST read data from the pipe and write it to the object indicated by the context handle. If an error is encountered during the write, the server SHOULD throw an RPC exception.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.2.4"></a>
##### 3.1.4.2.4 Receiving an EfsRpcCloseRaw Message (Opnum 3)

The EfsRpcCloseRaw method is called to release any resources allocated by the [EfsRpcOpenFileRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.1) method, or by subsequent calls to the [EfsRpcReadFileRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.2) or [EfsRpcWriteFileRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.3) methods.

void EfsRpcCloseRaw(

[in, out] PEXIMPORT_CONTEXT_HANDLE* hContext

);

**Return Values:** This method has no return values.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.2.5"></a>
##### 3.1.4.2.5 Receiving an EfsRpcEncryptFileSrv Message (Opnum 4)

The EfsRpcEncryptFileSrv method is used to convert a given object on the server to an encrypted state in the server's data store.

long EfsRpcEncryptFileSrv(

[in] handle_t binding_h,

[in, string] wchar_t* FileName

);

**binding_h:** This is an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) [**binding**](#gt_binding) handle parameter, as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**FileName:** An EFSRPC identifier as specified in section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1).

**Return Values:** The server MUST return 0 if it successfully processes the message received from the client. The server MUST return a nonzero value if processing fails.

If no object exists on the server with the specified name, the server MUST return a nonzero value. If the object exists and is already encrypted:

- If the object is a container for other objects, the server SHOULD return 0 to indicate success.
- If the object is not a container object, the server SHOULD check to confirm that the calling user has access to a private key that can decrypt the file and, if so, return 0 to indicate success. If the calling user does not have access to a private key that can decrypt the file, the server SHOULD return a nonzero value.
If the object exists and is not encrypted, the server SHOULD use the algorithm specified in section [3.1.4.1](#Section_3.1.1.1) to locate a user certificate for the calling user, specifying the client identity associated with the RPC call ([MS-RPCE] section 3.3.3.4.3) as input for the security context. If an error is returned by the algorithm specified in section 3.1.4.1, the server MUST return a nonzero value.

The server then performs the following actions to convert the object to an encrypted state in its data store:

- If the data object referred to by *FileName* exists on the server and is a container for other objects, the server MUST set an attribute on the container that instructs the data store to encrypt any new objects created in that container. The server MAY encrypt unencrypted objects that were already in the container before this message was received.
- Otherwise, the server SHOULD:
- Randomly generate a File Encryption Key (FEK) for the object and use it to encrypt the object.
- Create [EFSRPC Metadata](#Section_2.2.2) for the object, formatted as specified in section 2.2.2. The **Data Decryption Field** SHOULD contain a single entry corresponding to the user certificate mentioned above.
- Return 0 to indicate success.
Upon completion of this request, the converted object MUST be accessible to the calling user for read and write methods of the storage encryption system.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.2.6"></a>
##### 3.1.4.2.6 Receiving an EfsRpcDecryptFileSrv Message (Opnum 5)

**OpenFlag:** This parameter is unused and MUST be ignored by the server. It MUST be set to zero by the client.

**Return Values:** The server MUST return zero if it successfully processes the message received from the client. The server MUST return a nonzero value if processing fails.

If no object exists on the server with the specified name, the server MUST return a nonzero value. If the object exists and is not encrypted, the server MUST return success.

Otherwise, the server performs the following actions to convert the object in its data store to an unencrypted state:

- If the data object referred to by *FileName* is a container for other objects, the server MUST clear the attribute on the container that instructs the data store to encrypt any new objects created in that container. The server MAY decrypt encrypted objects that were already in the container before this message was received.
- Otherwise, the server SHOULD:
- Check that the calling user has access to a private key that will decrypt the file; if the user does not have access, return a nonzero value.
- Decrypt the object and discard its [EFSRPC Metadata](#Section_2.2.2).
- Return 0 to indicate success.

**binding_h:** This is an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) [**binding**](#gt_binding) handle parameter, as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**FileName:** An EFSRPC identifier, as specified in section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1).

**InfoClass:** One of the values in the following table. With the exception of UPDATE_KEY_USED (0x00000100), a server SHOULD support all of these values. A server MAY choose to support UPDATE_KEY_USED.<46>

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| BASIC_KEY_INFO 0x00000001 | Request information about the keys used to encrypt the object's contents. On success, the server will return the information in an [EFS_KEY_INFO](#Section_2.2.14) (2.2.14)structure in the *KeyInfo* parameter. |
| CHECK_COMPATIBILITY_INFO 0x00000002 | Requests the EfsVersion for the encrypted file. On success, the server will return the information in an [EFS_COMPATIBILITY_INFO](#Section_2.2.15) structure in the *KeyInfo* parameter. |
| UPDATE_KEY_USED 0x00000100 | Update the user [**certificates**](#gt_certificate) used to give a specific user access to an object. The server will populate the *KeyInfo* parameter with a zero-terminated, wide character [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) string that contains a newline-separated list of names of objects successfully updated. |
| CHECK_DECRYPTION_STATUS 0x00000200 | Request a hint from the server as to whether the given object could be successfully decrypted without further user intervention or higher-level events. The server will return this information in an [EFS_DECRYPTION_STATUS_INFO](#Section_2.2.17) structure in the *KeyInfo* parameter. |
| CHECK_ENCRYPTION_STATUS 0x00000400 | Request a hint from the server as to whether the given object could be successfully encrypted without further user intervention or higher-level events. The server will return this information in an [EFS_ENCRYPTION_STATUS_INFO](#Section_2.2.16) structure in the *KeyInfo* parameter. |

**KeyInfo:** Returned by the server, as previously specified.

**Return Values:** The server MUST return 0 if it successfully processes the message received from the client. The server MUST return a nonzero value if processing fails.

If no object exists on the server with the specified name the server MUST return a nonzero value.

If the *InfoClass* parameter is not equal to CHECK_ENCRYPTION_STATUS and the object with the specified name is not encrypted, the server MUST return a nonzero value.

If the value in the *InfoClass* parameter is unsupported by the server, the server MUST return a nonzero value.

If the value in the *InfoClass* parameter is equal to BASIC_KEY_INFO, the server SHOULD read the [EFSRPC Metadata](#Section_2.2.2) of the object referred to by the FileName argument and return information about its [**FEK**](#gt_file-encryption-key-fek) in an EFS_KEY_INFO structure within the KeyInfo argument.

If the value in the *InfoClass* parameter is equal to UPDATE_KEY_USED, the implementation supports this value, and the *FileName* parameter does not satisfy the implementation-specific requirements for this operation<47>, the server MUST return a nonzero value.

If the value in the *InfoClass* parameter is equal to UPDATE_KEY_USED, the implementation supports this value, and the *FileName* parameter does satisfy all implementation-specific requirements, the server MUST update the EFSRPC Metadata of all the data objects referred by *FileName* in an implementation-specific way<48>, and return a newline-separated list of EFSRPC Identifiers thus updated in the *KeyInfo* parameter.

If the value in the *InfoClass* parameter is equal to CHECK_ENCRYPTION_STATUS, the server MUST return an EFS_ENCRYPTION_STATUS_INFO structure in the *KeyInfo* parameter, which provides a hint to the client what error code would be returned if encryption was attempted on this object without any further user interaction or higher-level events.

If the value in the *InfoClass* parameter is equal to CHECK_DECRYPTION_STATUS, the server SHOULD return ERROR_REQUIRES_INTERACTIVE_WINDOWSTATION ([MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.2). The server MAY, instead, return an EFS_DECRYPTION_STATUS_INFO structure in the *KeyInfo* parameter, which provides a hint to the client what error code would be returned if decryption were attempted on this object without any further user interaction or higher-level events.

If the value of the InfoClass parameter is equal to CHECK_COMPATIBILITY_INFO, the server MUST return an EFS_COMPATIBILITY_INFO structure in the KeyInfo parameter, which provides the EFSVersion of the EFSRPC metadata associated with the file.

##### 3.1.4.2.13 Receiving an EfsRpcDuplicateEncryptionInfoFile Message (Opnum 13)

The EfsRpcDuplicateEncryptionInfoFile method is used to duplicate the [EFSRPC Metadata](#Section_2.2.2) of one encrypted object and attach it to another encrypted object. This is typically done when copying objects to maintain the same set of [**keys**](#gt_key) and users for the copy as for the original.

DWORD EfsRpcDuplicateEncryptionInfoFile(

[in] handle_t binding_h,

[in, string] wchar_t* SrcFileName,

[in] DWORD dwCreationDisposition,

[in] DWORD dwAttributes,

[in, unique] EFS_RPC_BLOB* RelativeSD,

[in] BOOL bInheritHandle

);

**binding_h:** This is an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) [**binding**](#gt_binding) handle parameter, as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**SrcFileName:** An EFSRPC identifier, as specified in section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1).

**DestFileName:** An EFSRPC identifier, as specified in section 2.2.1.

**dwCreationDisposition:** This parameter specifies what action the server is advised to take if the object referred to by *DestFileName* does not already exist. It MUST be one of the following values.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| CREATE_NEW 0x00000001 | Do not overwrite the data object referred to by *DestFileName* if it already exists. |
| CREATE_ALWAYS 0x00000002 | Overwrite the data object referred to by *DestFileName* if it already exists. |

**dwAttributes:** Desired attributes for the target object. Clients SHOULD set this parameter to the bitwise OR of zero or more of the following values. Servers SHOULD support all of these values. These values can be interpreted by the underlying server data store, and they do not affect protocol behavior.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN 0x00000002 | The file is hidden (not displayed in normal folder listings). |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE 0x00000020 | This attribute is used by applications to mark files for backup or removal. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY 0x00000100 | The file is being used for temporary storage. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NOT_CONTENT_INDEXED 0x00002000 | The file's contents are not to be indexed by the content indexing service. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL 0x00000080 | No other attributes are to be set. |

**RelativeSD:** Relative security descriptor for the target object. The format of this is implementation-dependent.<49>

**bInheritHandle:** This parameter SHOULD be set to FALSE by the client and SHOULD be ignored by the server.

**Return Values:** The server MUST return 0 if it successfully processes the message received from the client. The server MUST return a nonzero value if processing fails.<50>

If no object exists on the server with the name specified in the *SrcFileName* parameter, or if it exists and is not encrypted, the server MUST return a nonzero value.

If an encrypted object exists with the name specified in the *SrcFileName* and *dwCreationDisposition* parameters is equal to CREATE_NEW, then:

- If an object exists with the name specified in the *DestFileName* parameter, the server MUST return a nonzero value.
- If no object exists with the name specified in the *DestFileName* parameter, the server MUST create a new object with this name and duplicate the EFSRPC Metadata from the *SrcFileName* parameter into it. If the object specified in *SrcFileName* is a container for other objects, the server MUST create the object as a container for objects, and it MUST encrypt any objects that are subsequently placed in the container after this message has been processed. Otherwise, the server MUST create the object as a non-container encrypted data object.
If an encrypted object exists with the name specified in the *SrcFileName* and *dwCreationDisposition* parameters is not equal to CREATE_NEW, then:

- If an object already exists with the name specified in the *DestFileName* parameter, the server MUST check whether the object referred to by *SrcFileName* is of the same type (either simple object or container for other objects); if the object is not of the same type, the server MUST return a nonzero value. In addition, if the object referred to by *DestFileName* is a container for other objects, and it is not already encrypted, the server MUST return a nonzero value. Otherwise, the server SHOULD overwrite the object, clear its existing attributes, create a new object in its place with the attributes specified, and duplicate the EFSRPC Metadata from the *SrcFileName* parameter into it.
- If no object exists with the name specified in the *DestFileName* parameter, the server MUST create a new object with this name and duplicate the EFSRPC Metadata from the *SrcFileName* parameter into it. If the object specified in *SrcFileName* is a container for other objects, the server MUST create the object as a container for objects, and it MUST encrypt any objects that are subsequently placed in the container after this message has been processed. Otherwise, the server MUST create the object as a non-container encrypted data object.
In duplicating the EFSRPC Metadata from the *SrcFileName* parameter to the *DestFileName* parameter, the server MAY<51> change the metadata. However, upon successful completion, the set of users and [**DRAs**](#gt_data-recovery-agent-dra) with access to the *DestFileName* parameter MUST be the same set of users who had access to the *SrcFileName* parameter at the outset.

If the EFSRPC_ADDUSERFLAG_REPLACE_DDF flag is set in the *dwFlags* parameter, and the *EncryptionCertificates* parameter contains more than one certificate, the server MUST return a nonzero value.

If the EFSRPC_ADDUSERFLAG_REPLACE_DDF flag is set in the *dwFlags* parameter, and the calling user does not have the ability to decrypt the object, the server MUST return a nonzero value.

If the EFSRPC_ADDUSERFLAG_REPLACE_DDF flag is set in the *dwFlags* parameter, and the user certificate in the *EncryptionCertificates* parameter already has access to the object, then the server MUST return a zero value.

If the EFSRPC_ADDUSERFLAG_ADD_POLICY_KEYTYPE flag is specified in the *dwFlags* parameter, then for each certificate specified in the *EncryptionCertificates* parameter, the server MUST check whether the private [**key**](#gt_key) for the certificate is stored on a smart card. If the key is stored, the server MUST return a nonzero value; otherwise, the server MUST ignore this flag.

If the EFSRPC_ADDUSERFLAG_REPLACE_DDF flag is set in the *dwFlags* parameter, and the calling user has the ability to decrypt the object, then the certificate in the *EncryptionCertificates* parameter is to be given access to the object, replacing one of the calling user's user certificates through which he currently has access.

When **providerAttributes** is specified as above, if CallerIDString is present, it MUST be a string defined by the endpoint for key lookup; it MUST work only on that endpoint and only when used in conjunction with the matching UserSidString; SessionIDString MUST be a GUID, and when UserSidString is present, it MUST be the [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) (as specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.4.2.3) of the user who owns the key. EnterpriseID MUST be an Internet domain name that is not a top-level domain, as described in [[RFC1035]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90264).

**Flags:** This parameter is unused and MUST be ignored by the server. It MUST be set to zero by the client.

**Return Values:** The server MUST return 0 if it successfully processes the message received from the client. The server MUST return a nonzero value if processing fails.

If *ProtectorDescriptor* is NULL, follow the processing rules for [EfsRpcEncryptFileSrv](#Section_3.1.4.2.5), using the values of *binding_h* and *FileName*.

Otherwise, if no object exists on the server with the specified name, the server MUST return a nonzero value. If the object exists and is already encrypted:

- If the object is a container for other objects, the server SHOULD return 0 to indicate success.
- If the object is not a container object, the server SHOULD check to confirm that the calling user has access to a private key that can decrypt the file and, if so, return 0 to indicate success. If the calling user does not have access to a private key that can decrypt the file, the server SHOULD return a nonzero value.
If the object exists and is not encrypted, the server SHOULD use the RMS template to create a user Rights Management Services (RMS) Publishing License (PL) for the user, as specified in [MS-RMPR](../MS-RMPR/MS-RMPR.md) section 2.2.9.7, certificate for the calling user, specifying the client identity associated with the RPC call ([MS-RPCE] section 3.3.3.4.3) as input for the security context. If an error is returned when looking up the template or creating a PL, the server MUST return a nonzero value.

The server then performs the following actions to convert the object to an encrypted state in its data store:

- If the data object referred to by *FileName* exists on the server and is a container for other objects, the server MUST set an attribute on the container that instructs the data store to encrypt any new objects created in that container using a key associated with the *ProtectorDescriptor*. The server MAY encrypt unencrypted objects that were already in the container before this message was received.
- Otherwise, the server SHOULD:
- Randomly generate a File Encryption Key (FEK) for the object and use it to encrypt the object.
- If the ProtectorDescriptor is a DPAPI-NG protector, create EFSRPC Metadata Version 2 for the object, formatted as specified in section [2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2). The **Data Decryption Field** SHOULD contain a single entry corresponding to a DPAPI-NG protector as mentioned previously.
- If the ProtectorDescriptor is an RMS protector, create EFSRPC Metadata Version 3 for the object, formatted as specified in section 2.2.2.3.
- Return 0 to indicate success.
Upon completion of this request, the converted object MUST be accessible to the calling user for read and write methods of the storage encryption system.

##### 3.1.4.2.20 Receiving an EfsRpcQueryProtectors (Opnum 22)

The **EfsRpcQueryProtectors** method is used by the client to query the metadata of an encrypted object for protectors that are either RMS or DPAPI-NG and whose associated [**private keys**](#gt_private-key) can be used to decrypt the object.<64>

DWORD EfsRpcQueryProtectors(

[in] handle_t binding_h,

[in, string] wchar_t* FileName,

[out] PENCRYPTION_PROTECTOR_LIST **ppProtectorList

);

**binding_h:** This is an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) [**binding**](#gt_binding) handle parameter, as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**FileName:** An EFSRPC identifier, as specified in section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1).

**ppProtectorList:** A pointer to a list of [ENCRYPTION_PROTECTOR](#Section_2.2.19) structures as specified in section 2.2.19.

**Return Values:** The server MUST return a nonzero value.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Timer Events

This protocol does not specify any timers or timer events.

<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>
### 3.1.6 Other Local Events

If an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) connection between the client and the server is broken while transferring data using the EFSRPC raw methods, the server SHOULD take steps to de-allocate all resources allocated to that connection. If an error is encountered while processing any of the EFSRPC raw methods, the server SHOULD promptly tear down the connection to the client and reallocate all resources the connection was using.

<a id="Section_4"></a>
# 4 Protocol Examples

This section contains a complete example of how EFSRPC is used. In the following example, a user (User) uses a Windows XP client to encrypt a [**file**](#gt_file) on a Windows [**SMB**](#gt_server-message-block-smb) file [**server**](#gt_server) (Server1). The User then gives a colleague (Colleague) authorized access to this file, and requests one of the employees (Employee) to place the file on a second Windows SMB file server (Server2) so that the Colleague can access it.

Before starting this process, the User has obtained the Colleague's user [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) through some implementation-specific method. The User has also imported that certificate into the certificate stores on both the client computer and Server1. No explicit action from the User or Colleague is required for this step if User and Colleague are members of the same Active Directory [**domain**](#gt_domain) and the domain has been configured to automatically publish users' [**EFS**](#gt_encrypting-file-system-efs) user certificates to the Active Directory.

First, the User creates a file with the information he wants to share and places it on Server1. He then accesses the file's properties through the Windows Explorer user interface and marks the file as encrypted. This causes Windows Explorer to send an [EfsRpcEncryptFileSrv](#Section_3.1.4.2.5) message to Server1, and as a result the EFSRPC server encrypts the file located on Server1's disk to allow access to the file by the User alone. The User has now created an encrypted file on Server1 using EFSRPC.

To give the Colleague authorized access to this newly encrypted file, the User accesses the file's properties once more through Windows Explorer, and examines the list of user certificates that are authorized to decrypt the file. This causes Windows Explorer to send an [EfsRpcQueryUsersOnFile](#Section_3.1.4.2.7) message to the server to retrieve the list of authorized user certificates. After this call succeeds, Windows Explorer retrieves the list of authorized [**DRAs**](#gt_data-recovery-agent-dra) for the file by sending an [EfsRpcQueryRecoveryAgents](#Section_3.1.4.2.8) message to the server. The authorized user certificates and DRAs are then displayed in the user interface. The User can now see that he or she is currently the only user authorized to access the file.

The User then accesses the user interface to select the Colleague's user certificate, and chooses to authorize this user certificate to access the file. The Windows Explorer user interface sends an [EfsRpcAddUsersToFile](#Section_3.1.4.2.14) message to the server, which processes the request successfully. The Windows Explorer user interface once again sends an EfsRpcQueryUsersOnFile message and an EfsRpcQueryRecoveryAgents message to the server. The results are displayed to the User. The User can now see that both the Colleague and the User are authorized to access the file.

The User then leaves instructions with the Employee to transfer the file to another server, so that the Colleague can more easily obtain it. (The Employee has backup permissions on Server1 and restore permissions on Server2, but does not have a user or DRA private [**key**](#gt_key) that would allow authorized access to the encrypted file.) The Employee runs the ntbackup.exe utility to create a backup of the file from Server1 on the client machine. The ntbackup.exe utility sends an [EfsRpcOpenFileRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.1) message to Server1. When Server1 responds successfully, the ntbackup.exe utility sends an [EfsRpcReadFileRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.2) message to Server1 and writes the data returned over the associated pipe to a file on the Employee's client computer. When Server1 indicates that the end of the file has been reached, the ntbackup.exe utility sends an [EfsRpcCloseRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.4) message to the Server1. At this point, the Employee has a file on the client computer that contains the encrypted file from Server1 in the [EFSRPC Raw Data Format](#Section_2.2.3).

To complete the transfer of the encrypted file from Server1 to Server2, the Employee runs the ntbackup.exe utility again. This time, ntbackup.exe is invoked to restore the file on to Server2 from the backup file on the Employee's client computer. The ntbackup.exe utility sends an EfsRpcOpenFileRaw message to Server2. After receiving a successful response from Server2, the ntbackup.exe utility sends an [EfsRpcWriteFileRaw](#Section_3.1.4.2.3) message to Server2. The ntbackup.exe utility reads the data from the EFSRPC Raw Data Format file and sends that data over the pipe associated with the EfsRpcWriteFileRaw message. When the end of the EFSRPC Raw Data Format file has been reached, the ntbackup.exe utility flushes the pipe by performing a 0-byte write, and sends an EfsRpcCloseRaw message to Server2.

Now, the encrypted file has been recreated on Server2. The Colleague can access this file using SMB and work with it as needed. The User has successfully utilized EFSRPC to allow the Colleague access to a critical file, using only secure EFSRPC methods.

# 5 Security

<a id="Section_5.1"></a>
## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

It is recommended that encrypted data be stored so as to minimize the risk of information disclosure in case of offline attack. In particular, the plaintext of encrypted objects and all keying material are to be treated as highly sensitive information. It is also important to protect against attackers substituting user's [**certificates**](#gt_certificate) and private [**keys**](#gt_key) with those of their choosing.

The EFSRPC raw methods are used for backup and restoration of encrypted data. Because this data typically has high value, it is recommended that these methods be implemented so as to avoid exposing any [**plaintext**](#gt_plaintext) to the caller or to an eavesdropper Implementing some form of integrity protection is advised to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks, where a malicious adversary can modify the contents of the marshaled data in transit. Windows Vista operating system and Windows Server 2008 operating system use packet privacy to achieve this, as described in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).

Carefully choosing an encryption algorithm and a key length that are appropriate for the use scenario is recommended. For example, in version 1 of the protocol, it is recommended that the export version of CALG_DESX described in this document be avoided. It is no longer considered secure against brute force attacks. The use of CALG_3DES is also deprecated at present. The use of CALG_AES_256 is strongly recommended. When using [**RSA**](#gt_rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa) for asymmetric cryptography, it is currently recommended that the keys used be at least 2,048 bits long.

# 7 Appendix B: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

The terms "earlier" and "later", when used with a product version, refer to either all preceding versions or all subsequent versions, respectively. The term "through" refers to the inclusive range of versions. Applicable Microsoft products are listed chronologically in this section.

**Client**

- Windows 2000 operating system
- Windows XP operating system
- Windows Vista operating system
- Windows 7 operating system
- Windows 8 operating system
- Windows 8.1 operating system
- Windows 10 operating system
- Windows 11 operating system
**Server**

- Windows 2000 Server operating system
- Windows Server 2003 operating system
- Windows Server 2008 operating system
- Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system
- Windows Server 2016 operating system
- Windows Server 2019 operating system
- Windows Server 2022 operating system
- Windows Server 2025 operating system
Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.5: EFSRPC calls to a Windows-based EFSRPC server will fail, returning an error, if the server is running an edition of the operating system that does not include [**EFS**](#gt_encrypting-file-system-efs). Specifically, Windows XP Home Edition operating system and Windows XP Starter Edition operating system editions of Windows do not include EFS functionality and do not support EFSRPC.

Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 do not use [**SSPI**](#gt_security-support-provider-interface-sspi) to secure the EFSRPC raw methods; otherwise, Windows does use SSPI to secure the EFSRPC raw methods. For more details, see the product behavior notes in Appendix B regarding section [2.1](#Section_2.1).

<2> Section 1.5: The Windows 2000 implementation supports EFSRPC in workgroup settings and on domain-joined computers that are not configured for Kerberos delegation.

<3> Section 1.9: This endpoint is not available in Windows 11, version 22H2 operating system and later and Windows Server 2022, 23H2 operating system and later.

<4> Section 2.1: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 servers listen for EFSRPC messages only on the well-known endpoint \pipe\lsarpc.

Otherwise, Windows based servers listen for EFSRPC messages on both \pipe\lsarpc and \pipe\efsrpc.

The \pipe\lsarpc endpoint is not available in Windows 11 v22H2 and later and Windows Server 2022, 23H2 and later.

<5> Section 2.1: Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 neither register this provider on the server nor attempt to use it on the client.

The following changes apply after the [[MSFT-CVE-2021-43893]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2183237) security update (applies to Windows 7 operating system and later, and Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later):

- Windows EFSRPC [**servers**](#gt_server) require the RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY RPC authentication level on all EFSRPC methods.
- Windows clients attempt to use this level for the EFSRPC raw methods and can be configured to require its use. If an error is encountered, and the client is not configured to require security, the client falls back to connecting over an unsecured RPC connection.
- Windows clients use this level for all other EFSRPC methods.
<6> Section 2.2.1: Windows implementations restrict [**file**](#gt_file) and [**folder**](#gt_folder) names to 5,120 [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) characters, not including the null terminator. An error is returned if this limit is exceeded.

<7> Section 2.2.2.1: Windows implementations place an upper limit of 262,144 bytes on the length of the [EFSRPC Metadata](#Section_2.2.2). Windows servers will return an error when passed EFSRPC Metadata that exceeds this limit, or when an EFSRPC call would require Windows servers to create or extend a file’s EFSRPC Metadata beyond this limit.

<8> Section 2.2.2.1: Windows 2000 supports only version 1. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 support only versions 1 and 2.

<9> Section 2.2.2.1: The Windows 2000 implementation sets this field to the MD5 hash of the complete EFSRPC Metadata, computed with the EFS hash field set to zero. The Windows 2000 implementation will also verify the checksum whenever EFSRPC Metadata is passed to it, and will return an error in case of a mismatch.

<10> Section 2.2.2.1.2: This value is unsupported on Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. These versions of Windows set this field to zero when creating the [**EFSRPC Metadata**](#gt_efsrpc-metadata), ignore its value when processing the metadata, and expect the [**FEK**](#gt_file-encryption-key-fek) to be encrypted using [**RSA**](#gt_rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa).

<11> Section 2.2.2.1.5: A Windows EFSRPC server will return an error if the total length of this structure exceeds 1,086 bytes.

<12> Section 2.2.2.2: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 operating system, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2 do not support EFS Version 5.

<13> Section 2.2.2.2:

Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 do not support Version 2 of the EFSRPC Metadata.

Windows servers only generate Version 2 metadata for encrypted files when an ECDH protector is added to an encrypted file. This could happen through any of the below procedures:

- Calling EfsRpcAddUsers* with at least one ECDH certificate. If the existing file has version 1 metadata, it is updated to version 2 before adding the new certificate.
- A file is encrypted and the user's current key is an ECDH certificate.
- DRA policy specifies at least one ECDH certificate.
<14> Section 2.2.2.2: Windows implementations place an upper limit of 262,144 bytes on the length of the EFSRPC Metadata. Windows servers will return an error when passed EFSRPC Metadata that exceeds this limit, or when an EFSRPC call would require Windows servers to create or extend a file’s EFSRPC Metadata beyond this limit.

<15> Section 2.2.2.2.2: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2 do not support the protection descriptor string.

<16> Section 2.2.2.2.2: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2 do not support EFSX_TYPE_DPAPI_NG_DATA.

<17> Section 2.2.2.2.3: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2 do not support this value.

<18> Section 2.2.2.3: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2 do not support EFS Version 6.

<19> Section 2.2.2.3: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2 do not support Version 3 of the EFSRPC Metadata. Otherwise, servers only generate Version 3 metadata for encrypted files when an RMS protector is added to an encrypted file.

<20> Section 2.2.3.3: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 ignore this field.

<21> Section 2.2.6: The Windows implementation of the EFSRPC server returns an error if the size of this encoded [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) exceeds 32 kilobytes. This restriction is represented in the range attribute of cbData.

<22> Section 2.2.7: As a defensive measure against overflow attacks, the Windows implementation of the EFSRPC server restricts the size of the **bData** field to 100 bytes, and returns an error if this size is exceeded. This restriction is represented by the range attribute of cbData.

<23> Section 2.2.9: As a defensive measure against overflow attacks, the Windows implementation of the EFSRPC server restricts the number of entries in this array to 500, and returns an error if this size is exceeded. This restriction is represented in the range attribute of nUsers.

<24> Section 2.2.11: As a defensive measure against overflow attacks, the Windows implementation of the EFSRPC server restricts the number of entries in this array to 500, and returns an error if this size is exceeded. This restriction is represented in the range attribute of nCert_Hash.

<25> Section 2.2.12: As a defensive measure against overflow attacks, the Windows implementation of the EFSRPC server restricts the size of this object to 260 kilobytes, and returns an error if this size is exceeded. This restriction is represented in the range attribute of cbData.

<26> Section 2.2.13: Windows 2000 does not support either of these algorithms. Windows XP only supports CALG_3DES.

<27> Section 2.2.13: Windows 2000 supports only the following algorithms.

| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable | CALG_DESX (domestic) | 0x6604 128 16 |
| Variable | CALG_DESX (export) | 0x6604 56 16 |

In the preceding table, the difference between entropy and key length for CALG_DESX (export) exists only because the first 56 bits are random and the rest are set to zero.

Otherwise, when accessing existing encrypted objects Windows support the two CALG_DESX algorithms.

When creating new encrypted objects, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 support the two CALG_DESX algorithms only if allowed by the prevailing policy.

<28> Section 2.2.13: When accessing existing encrypted objects, Windows implementations do not restrict the set of supported algorithms according to policy.

When creating new encrypted objects, Windows implementations restrict the algorithm according to the **FIPSAlgorithmPolicy** setting defined in the following registry locations.

| Operating system | Registry key | Registry value | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows XP/Windows Server 2003 | **HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa** | **FIPSAlgorithmPolicy** | **REG_DWORD** |
| Windows Vista/ Windows Server 2008 Windows 7/Windows Server 2008 R2 Windows 8/Windows Server 2012 | **HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FIPSAlgorithmPolicy** | **Enabled** | **REG_DWORD** |

On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, if the value is nonzero (enabled), newly created encrypted objects are restricted to using the CALG_3DES algorithm.

Otherwise, on Windows if the value is not zero (enabled), newly created encrypted objects are restricted to using the CALG_AES_256 algorithm.

<29> Section 2.2.15: Windows compatibility with EFSRPC Metadata versions is summarized by the following table.

| EfsVersion | Minimum operating system |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Windows 2000 |
| 2 | Windows XP / Windows Server 2003 |
| 3 | Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 |
| 4 | Windows 7 / Windows Server 2008 R2 |
| 5 | Windows 8.1 / Windows Server 2012 R2 |
| 6 | Windows 10 and later/ Windows Server 2016 and later |

<30> Section 2.2.19: The ENCRYPTION_PROTECTOR structure is not available on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2.

<31> Section 2.2.20: The ENCRYPTION_PROTECTOR_LIST structure is not available on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2.

<32> Section 3: Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 do not support this option; they neither register any SSPI providers on the server side nor request any on the client side.

The following changes apply after the [MSFT-CVE-2021-43893] security update (applies to Windows 7 and later, and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and later):

- Windows EFSRPC servers require the RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY RPC authentication level on all EFSRPC methods.
- Windows clients attempt to use this level for the EFSRPC raw methods and can be configured to require its use. If an error is encountered, and the client is not configured to require security, the client falls back to connecting over an unsecured RPC connection.
- Windows clients use this level for all other EFSRPC methods.
<33> Section 3.1.1: RMS template GUID and DPAPI-NG protection rule are not supported on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2.

<34> Section 3.1.3: The \pipe\lsarpc endpoint is not available in Windows 11 v22H2 and later.

<35> Section 3.1.3: Windows will register an SSPI provider to support RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY.

Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 do not support this option.

<36> Section 3.1.4.2: The \pipe\lsarpc endpoint is not available in Windows 11 v22H2 and later.

<37> Section 3.1.4.2: Windows 2000 supports methods with [**opnums**](#gt_opnum) 0 through 11. For opnum 11, it behaves as the [EfsRpcDuplicateEncryptionInfoFile](#Section_3.1.4.2.13) method. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 support opnum 0 through opnum 13, with opnum 11 being implemented as the [EfsRpcNotSupported](#Section_3.1.4.2.11) method.

The **EfsRpcEncryptFileExSrv** and **EfsRpcQueryProtectors** methods are not supported on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2.

<38> Section 3.1.4.2: After installation of one of the updates listed in [[MSFT-CVE-2022-26925]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2201451), a client using a null session will receive RPC_S_ACCESS_DENIED when calling any of these methods using lsarpc.

<39> Section 3.1.4.2: Gaps in the opnum numbering sequence apply to Windows as follows.

| Opnum | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 10 | Only used locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 14 | Only used locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 17 | Only used locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 23-44 | Only used locally by Windows, never remotely. |

<40> Section 3.1.4.2: Implementations of nonstandard behavior for deprecated methods in Windows are summarized below. See the behavior notes for each corresponding method section for details of nonstandard behavior on each Windows implementation.

| Method | Opnum | Operating System |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EfsRpcNotSupported | 11 | Windows 2000 |
| [EfsRpcFileKeyInfoEx](#Section_d0da10ab31394d67a66cea6eb497118d) | 16 | Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 |
| [EfsRpcGetEncryptedFileMetadata](#Section_5cb4e26d563240488b2df661f8e8ee6b) | 18 | Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 |
| [EfsRpcSetEncryptedFileMetadata](#Section_38a5a7d34d474075b830b657805f2e94) | 19 | Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 |

<41> Section 3.1.4.2: Windows 2000 returns ERROR_NO_RECOVERY_POLICY (specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md)).

<42> Section 3.1.4.2.1: The following versions of Windows with [[MSFT-CVE-2021-36942]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2169361) will return error code ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED for the EfsRpcOpenFileRaw method using the \pipe\lsarpc endpoint:

- Windows Server 2008 through Windows Server 2022
- Windows 7 through Windows 11
Note that the \pipe\lsarpc endpoint is not available in Windows 11 v22H2 and later and Windows Server 2022, 23H2 and later.

<43> Section 3.1.4.2.1: If the **CREATE_FOR_DIR** flag is set, and the **CREATE_FOR_IMPORT** flag is also set, Windows will attempt to create a folder with the specified name instead of a file.

<44> Section 3.1.4.2.11: Windows 2000 responds to this opnum as described in section 3.1.4.2.13.

<45> Section 3.1.4.2.11: Windows 2000 performs the processing specified in section 3.1.4.2.13.

<46> Section 3.1.4.2.12: UPDATE_KEY_USED is only supported on Windows Server 2003. CHECK_DECRYPTION_STATUS and CHECK_ENCRYPTION_STATUS are not supported on Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. CHECK_COMPATIBILITY_INFO is not supported on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, or Windows Server 2008.

<47> Section 3.1.4.2.12: Windows Server 2003 requires that UPDATE_KEY_USED only be used with a folder name. If not, an error is returned.

<48> Section 3.1.4.2.12: Windows Server 2003 updates the EFSRPC Metadata of all the encrypted files and folders accessible by the calling user in the *FileName* parameter or one of its subfolders to use a single user certificate for that user.

<49> Section 3.1.4.2.13: The data portion of the EFS_RPC_BLOB structure is expected to contain a security descriptor. This is an opaque data type in Windows that is best manipulated only indirectly through the APIs provided for this purpose, as specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) sections 2.4.6 and 2.5.

<50> Section 3.1.4.2.13: The EfsRpcDuplicateEncryptionInfoFile method was associated with opnum 11 in Windows 2000; therefore, it cannot be used between a Windows 2000 client and a server running a different version of Windows, or vice versa.

<51> Section 3.1.4.2.13: For files using version 1 of the EFSRPC Metadata, Windows based servers will generate a new FEK for the *DestFileName* parameter if only one user has access to the *SrcFileName* parameter. This is to ensure that users who get access to one of the two files at a later date do not automatically get the ability to decrypt the other file. Windows 2000 does not do this.

For files using version 2 of the EFSRPC Metadata, Windows 7 and later and Windows Server 2008 R2 and later servers will always generate a new file IV for the *DestFileName* parameter, and will generate a new FEK/FMK for the *DestFileName* parameter if no legacy RSA user protectors exist on the *SrcFileName* parameter. Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 do not do this.

<52> Section 3.1.4.2.15: Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 implement this method identically to the implementation of [EfsRpcFileKeyInfo](#Section_3.1.4.2.15), ignoring the *dwFileKeyInfoFlags* and *Reserved* parameters.

<53> Section 3.1.4.2.15: Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 use this parameter in the manner identical to how it is used in the implementation of EfsRpcFileKeyInfo.

<54> Section 3.1.4.2.15: Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 return "0" if all conditions listed in the description for EfsRpcFileKeyInfo are met.

<55> Section 3.1.4.2.16: Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 implement this method in the following way:

If no object exists with the name specified in the *FileName* parameter, or if it exists and is not encrypted, the server returns a nonzero value. Otherwise, the server returns the EFSRPC Metadata of the object in the *EfsStreamBlob* parameter, and returns 0 for the method.

<56> Section 3.1.4.2.16: Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 use this parameter to return the EFSRPC Metadata associated with the object referred to by *FileName*.

<57> Section 3.1.4.2.16: Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 return "0" if all conditions listed in the first Product Behavior note for this section are met.

<58> Section 3.1.4.2.17: Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 implement this method in the following way:

If no object exists on the server with the name specified in the *FileName* parameter, or if it exists and is not encrypted, the server returns a nonzero value.

If an encrypted object exists with the name specified in the *FileName* parameter, and its metadata does not match exactly with the contents of the *OldEfsStreamBlob* parameter, the server returns a nonzero value.

If the **NewEfsSignature** field is non-NULL and the certificate thumbprint in that field does not correspond to a certificate whose corresponding private key is capable of decrypting the object, the server returns a nonzero value.

If the **NewEfsSignature** field is NULL and the calling user does not have access to any private key that can decrypt the object, the server returns a nonzero value.

If the **NewEfsStreamBlob** parameter does not satisfy the Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 requirements for the syntax of EFSRPC Metadata, the server returns a nonzero value.

If none of the preceding conditions are true, then the server replaces the object's EFSRPC Metadata with the contents of the *NewEfsStreamBlob* and returns a 0 value.

<59> Section 3.1.4.2.17: Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 expect this parameter to be the existing EFSRPC Metadata on the object referred to by *FileName*. If this parameter is not NULL, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 will return an error if the metadata does not match the existing EFSRPC Metadata on the object.

<60> Section 3.1.4.2.17: Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 expect this parameter to be the new EFSRPC Metadata (as specified in section 2.2.2) intended for the object, and will return an error if this is not so.

<61> Section 3.1.4.2.17: Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 expect that if this parameter is not NULL, it contains an [**X.509**](#gt_x509) certificate whose corresponding private key already has the ability to decrypt the object and the signature over the new EFSRPC Metadata with this key, and will return an error if this is not so.

<62> Section 3.1.4.2.17: Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 return 0 if all conditions listed in the first Product Behavior note for this section are met and the new EFSRPC Metadata on the file or folder is successfully modified.

<63> Section 3.1.4.2.19: The **EfsRpcEncryptFileExSrv** method is not available on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2.

<64> Section 3.1.4.2.20: The **EfsRpcQueryProtectors** method is not available on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2.
