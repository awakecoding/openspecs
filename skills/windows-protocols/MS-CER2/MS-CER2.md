# 1 Introduction

The Corporate Error Reporting V.2 Protocol is designed to enable enterprise computing sites to manage all error reporting information within the organization. Through the use of this protocol, problem reports that are generated on a set of client machines can be directed to a local or remote server. This protocol is layered on top of the HTTP protocol.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_american-national-standards-institute-ansi-character-set"></a>
**American National Standards Institute (ANSI) character set**: A character set defined by a code page approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The term "ANSI" as used to signify Windows code pages is a historical reference and a misnomer that persists in the Windows community. The source of this misnomer stems from the fact that the Windows code page 1252 was originally based on an ANSI draft, which became International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 8859-1 [[ISO/IEC-8859-1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90689). In Windows, the ANSI character set can be any of the following code pages: 1252, 1250, 1251, 1253, 1254, 1255, 1256, 1257, 1258, 874, 932, 936, 949, or 950. For example, "ANSI application" is usually a reference to a non-Unicode or code-page-based application. Therefore, "ANSI character set" is often misused to refer to one of the character sets defined by a Windows code page that can be used as an active system code page; for example, character sets defined by code page 1252 or character sets defined by code page 950. Windows is now based on Unicode, so the use of ANSI character sets is strongly discouraged unless they are used to interoperate with legacy applications or legacy data.

<a id="gt_augmented-backus-naur-form-abnf"></a>
**Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)**: A modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), commonly used by Internet specifications. ABNF notation balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power. ABNF differs from standard BNF in its definitions and uses of naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges. For more information, see [[RFC5234]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096).

<a id="gt_bucket"></a>
**bucket**: A positive integer value that represents a mapping for a specific error signature.

<a id="gt_buckettableid"></a>
**BucketTableID**: A positive integer value that is used to further disambiguate particular [**error signatures**](#gt_error-signature), assigned by a hosted error reporting service.

<a id="gt_cer-client"></a>
**CER client**: A client configured to use the Corporate Error Reporting Version 1.0 Protocol or Corporate Error Reporting V2 Protocol.

<a id="gt_cer-server"></a>
**CER server**: A designated server application that acts as a recipient for the [**error report level 1 data**](#gt_error-report-level-1-data) and [**error report level 2 data**](#gt_error-report-level-2-data) that is created by the Corporate Error Reporting V.2 Protocol.

<a id="gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc"></a>
**Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**: A high-precision atomic time standard that approximately tracks Universal Time (UT). It is the basis for legal, civil time all over the Earth. Time zones around the world are expressed as positive and negative offsets from UTC. In this role, it is also referred to as Zulu time (Z) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). In these specifications, all references to UTC refer to the time at UTC-0 (or GMT).

<a id="gt_destination-server"></a>
**destination server**: The host name (as specified in [[RFC1738]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90287) section 5) in the destination URL. This is the host where the [**CER server**](#gt_cer-server) is running.

<a id="gt_destination-server-port"></a>
**destination server port**: The port number where the upload happens.

<a id="gt_error-report-level-1-data"></a>
**error report level 1 data**: The data that is transmitted to the [**CER server**](#gt_cer-server) that contains basic information about the problem.

<a id="gt_error-report-level-2-data"></a>
**error report level 2 data**: The information that is contained in a set of files that describe a problem event that has occurred on the system. The report is typically compressed into a single file for transmission.

<a id="gt_error-signature"></a>
**error signature**: An ordered collection of strings that represents an individual error or class of errors.

<a id="gt_language-code-identifier-lcid"></a>
**language code identifier (LCID)**: A 32-bit number that identifies the user interface human language dialect or variation that is supported by an application or a client computer.

<a id="gt_level-1-destination-url"></a>
**level 1 destination URL**: The location to which the [**error report level 1 data**](#gt_error-report-level-1-data) is uploaded. For more information about URLs, see [RFC1738].

<a id="gt_level-1-server-response"></a>
**level 1 server response**: The response data from the [**CER server**](#gt_cer-server) after processing [**error report level 1 data**](#gt_error-report-level-1-data).

<a id="gt_level-2-destination-url"></a>
**level 2 destination URL**: The location to which [**error report level 2 data**](#gt_error-report-level-2-data) is uploaded. For more information about URLs, see [RFC1738].

<a id="gt_level-2-destination-url-path"></a>
**level 2 destination url-path**: The url-path excluding the host and port for the [**level 2 destination URL**](#gt_level-2-destination-url).

<a id="gt_oem"></a>
**OEM**: Original Equipment Manufacturer

<a id="gt_proxy"></a>
**proxy**: A network node that accepts network traffic originating from one network agent and transmits it to another network agent.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The Corporate Error Reporting V.2 Protocol provides an enterprise computing site with the ability to transfer error reports from a set of client machines to a [**CER server**](#gt_cer-server), and to get a response from the CER server for the error report.

An error event, such as an application or kernel fault, causes the client system to collect information for an error report. This protocol does not create the original contents of the error report.

The Corporate Error Reporting V.2 Protocol works in two levels or stages: level 1 and level 2. Level 1 of the protocol is always executed. In level 1, the client creates [**error report level 1 data**](#gt_error-report-level-1-data) and uploads it to the CER server by creating a [**level 1 destination URL**](#gt_level-1-destination-url) using HTTP POST. The CER server then parses the [**level 1 server response**](#gt_level-1-server-response), and based on the results of that process, can initiate level 2 of the protocol. In level 2 of the protocol, the client creates a cab file [[MSDN-CAB]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=226293) and uploads it to the CER server by creating a [**level 2 destination URL**](#gt_level-2-destination-url) using HTTP PUT.

## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol is built on top of the HTTP 1.1 protocol [[RFC2616]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90372) and has direct dependency on it. Depending on the authentication mechanism needed to perform the upload to a URL, this protocol can have dependencies on authentication protocols.<1>

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The following prerequisites or preconditions apply to this protocol:

- The client system is able to create error reports.
- An implementation-specific file compression algorithm is required to organize the error reporting information into one file.
- The client is configured with the [**destination server**](#gt_destination-server) name.
- The client has network connectivity and is able to contact the destination server via HTTP.
- The [**CER server**](#gt_cer-server) application is running on the destination server, is properly configured, and can respond to the requests that come from the client.
- If the upload is performed over an HTTPS connection, certificates might need to be pre-deployed on the server, client, or both.
- If network authentication is used, the necessary underlying authentication mechanisms are present and enabled on the server, client, or both.
<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is not designed to be used by any other protocols. It is appropriate for small, medium, or large organizations that want to manage and review all error reporting information within the organization.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

- Supported Transports: This protocol is implemented on top of HTTP 1.1 [[RFC2616]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90372).
- Security and Authentication Methods: This protocol relies on HTTPS [[RFC2818]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90383), NTLM [MS-NTHT](../MS-NTHT/MS-NTHT.md), and Kerberos [[RFC4559]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90483) network authentication.
<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

This protocol MUST use HTTP 1.1. The client or server can impose additional requirements on authentication and security as part of the transfer. When additional requirements are imposed, authentication information MUST be exchanged between the clients and server as required by HTTP and the relevant authentication and security protocols. The transport can require [**proxy**](#gt_proxy) resolution.

The ordering of the elements for **StatusRule** is not specific; the elements can be in any order.

**Response**: This parameter instructs the CER client to display a response prompt pointing to the URL specified by this parameter.

**BucketID**: This parameter is a [**Bucket**](#gt_bucket); that is, it is a positive decimal integer.

**BucketTableID**: A positive decimal integer. If present, [**BucketTableID**](#gt_buckettableid) is used to categorize BucketID values into different categories.

**iData**: The value "1" instructs the CER client that an error report MUST be generated for this [**error signature**](#gt_error-signature).

**MemoryDump**: The value "1" instructs the CER client to add sections of the memory address space of the affected process to the error report.

**RegKeyValues**: This parameter lists any number of semicolon-delimited values to collect and include in the error report.

**fDoc**: A value of "1" instructs the CER client that the contents of any currently open documents in the software that generated the error report are to be added to the error report.

**WQLKeyValues**: A string value that instructs the CER client to collect the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects (as specified in *[LAVY-MEGGITT]*) that are specified by this parameter, and include them in this error report.

**WQL**: This is the WMI query syntax that is specified in *[LAVY-MEGGITT]*.

**GetFile**: This parameter lists any number of semicolon-delimited file names to collect and include in the error report. It MUST be in a file path notation supported by the client systems that are expected to encounter the type of error this file corresponds to. The notation MUST support environment variables.

**GetFileVersion**: This parameter lists any number of semicolon-delimited file names to collect version information from and include in the error report. It MUST be in a file path notation supported by the client systems that are expected to encounter the type of error this file corresponds to. The notation MUST support environment variables.

**RegTreeValues**: This parameter lists any number of semicolon-delimited values to enumerate and recourse through, and to include in the error report.

**Url**: This is specified in [[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453).

**DumpFile**: This parameter is used as the [**level 2 destination url-path**](#gt_level-2-destination-url-path) for uploading CAB data to the CER server.

<a id="Section_2.2.3"></a>
### 2.2.3 Error Report Level 2 Data

Level 2 of the protocol is initiated if there are files added to the report that have to be uploaded, and if the server requests additional files. In [**error report level 2 data**](#gt_error-report-level-2-data) of the protocol, the client will create a cab file [[MSDN-CAB]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=226293) and upload it to the CER server by creating a [**level 2 destination URL**](#gt_level-2-destination-url) by using HTTP PUT.

## 3.1 Client Details

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model, as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in the document.

- **Destination Server**
- **Destination Server Port**
- **UseHTTPS:** Indicates that uploads MUST happen over HTTPS.
- **UseAuthentication:** Indicates that uploads MUST use network authentication.
<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

- The [**CER client**](#gt_cer-client) MUST check for the existence of a [**destination server**](#gt_destination-server). If a destination server is not set or if it is not valid, the CER client MUST stop processing.
- The CER client MUST also check whether the [**destination server port**](#gt_destination-server-port) is set; if it is set, then the CER client MUST use the destination server port for any communication with the [**CER server**](#gt_cer-server). If the destination server port is not set, it defaults to port 1273.
<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

- When the [**CER server**](#gt_cer-server) receives an [**error report level 1 data**](#gt_error-report-level-1-data) message, it MUST respond with a [**level 1 server response**](#gt_level-1-server-response) reply.
- When the [**CER client**](#gt_cer-client) receives a level 1 server response and if the response message requests additional data (that is, iData is set to 1), and if there is additional data to upload, the following must take place:
- CER client MUST collect as much of the requested data as possible; for example, if a file is requested in the **GetFile** section of level 1 server response that is not present on the system, then the file cannot be included but the error report MUST still be made. The method of data collection is implementation-specific.<2>
**Note** There is no requirement that two clients use the same method or format of error information.

- The CER client MUST compress the complete report information into a single file by using any implementation-specific file compression.<3>
**Note** There is no requirement that two clients use the same file compression scheme.

### 3.2.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

When the [**CER server**](#gt_cer-server) receives an [**error report level 1 data**](#gt_error-report-level-1-data) message, it MUST respond with a Level 1 Server Response reply. The CER server authenticates the client, if required. The CER server can add the appropriate URL to the Level 1 Server Response as specified in [[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453).

- When the CER server receives an error report level 1 data message, the CER server MUST copy the information contained in the error report level 1 data to the CER fileshare.
