# 1 Introduction

The Group Policy: IP Security (IPsec) Protocol Extension is layered on top of the Group Policy: Core Protocol (as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md)). The transmitted configuration data enables centralized (common) configuration of the [**IPsec component**](#gt_ipsec-component) on multiple client systems to provide basic traffic filtering, data integrity, and optionally, data encryption for IP traffic.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses LDAP as its primary access protocol. [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) stores information about a variety of objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md). [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is either deployed as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), which are both described in [MS-ADOD](../MS-ADOD/MS-ADOD.md): Active Directory Protocols Overview.

<a id="gt_authentication-header-ah"></a>
**authentication header (AH)**: An [**Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) encapsulation mode that provides authentication and message integrity. For more information, see [[RFC4302]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90466) section 1.

<a id="gt_binary-large-object-blob"></a>
**binary large object (BLOB)**: A collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database.

<a id="gt_client-side-extension-guid-cse-guid"></a>
**client-side extension GUID (CSE GUID)**: A [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) that enables a specific client-side extension on the Group Policy client to be associated with policy data that is stored in the logical and physical components of a [**Group Policy Object (GPO)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) on the Group Policy server, for that particular extension.

<a id="gt_curly-braced-guid-string"></a>
**curly braced GUID string**: The string representation of a 128-bit globally unique identifier ([**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid)) using the form {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}, where X denotes a hexadecimal digit. The string representation between the enclosing braces is the standard representation of a GUID as described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) section 3. Unlike a GUIDString, a curly braced GUID string includes enclosing braces.

<a id="gt_default-response-rule"></a>
**default response rule**: A rule that ensures that computers respond to requests for secure communication. If an active policy does not have a rule defined for a computer that is requesting secure communication, the default response rule is applied and security is negotiated.

<a id="gt_directory"></a>
**directory**: The database that stores information about objects such as users, groups, computers, printers, and the directory service that makes this information available to users and applications.

<a id="gt_directory-string"></a>
**directory string**: A string encoded in UTF-8 as defined in [[RFC2252]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90326) section 6.10.

<a id="gt_distinguished-name-dn"></a>
**distinguished name (DN)**: A name that uniquely identifies an object by using the relative distinguished name (RDN) for the object, and the names of container objects and domains that contain the object. The distinguished name (DN) identifies the object and its location in a tree.

<a id="gt_domain"></a>
**domain**: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a domain controller (DC) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) service. The domain controller provides authentication of members, creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD](../MS-AUTHSOD/MS-AUTHSOD.md) section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

<a id="gt_encapsulating-security-payload-esp"></a>
**Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)**: An [**Internet Protocol security (IPsec)**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) encapsulation mode that provides authentication, data confidentiality, and message integrity.

<a id="gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn"></a>
**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**: An unambiguous domain name that gives an absolute location in the Domain Name System's (DNS) hierarchy tree, as defined in [[RFC1035]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90264) section 3.1 and [[RFC2181]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=127732) section 11.

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [RFC4122] or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_group-policy"></a>
**Group Policy**: A mechanism that allows the implementer to specify managed configurations for users and computers in an [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) service environment.

<a id="gt_group-policy-extension"></a>
**Group Policy extension**: A protocol that extends the functionality of Group Policy. Group Policy extensions consist of client-side extensions and Administrative tool extensions. They provide settings and other Group Policy information that can be read from and written to Group Policy data store components. Group Policy Extensions depend on the Group Policy: Core Protocol, via the core Group Policy engine, to identify [**GPOs**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) containing a list of extensions that apply to a particular Group Policy client.

<a id="gt_group-policy-object-gpo"></a>
**Group Policy Object (GPO)**: A collection of administrator-defined specifications of the policy settings that can be applied to groups of computers in a domain. Each GPO includes two elements: an object that resides in the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) for the domain, and a corresponding file system subdirectory that resides on the sysvol DFS share of the Group Policy server for the domain.

<a id="gt_internet-key-exchange-ike"></a>
**Internet Key Exchange (IKE)**: The protocol that is used to negotiate and provide authenticated keying material for [**security associations (SAs)**](#gt_security-association-sa) in a protected manner. For more information, see [[RFC2409]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90349).

<a id="gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec"></a>
**Internet Protocol security (IPsec)**: A framework of open standards for ensuring private, secure communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks through the use of cryptographic security services. IPsec supports network-level peer authentication, data origin authentication, data integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection.

<a id="gt_internet-security-association-and-key-management-protocol-isakmp"></a>
**Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)**: A cryptographic protocol specified in [[RFC2408]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90348) that defines procedures and packet formats to establish, negotiate, modify and delete [**security associations (SAs)**](#gt_security-association-sa). It forms the basis of the [**Internet Key Exchange (IKE)**](#gt_internet-key-exchange-ike) protocol, as specified in [RFC2409].

<a id="gt_ipsec-administrative-plug-in"></a>
**IPsec administrative plug-in**: The [**Internet Protocol security (IPsec)**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) extension plug-in that operates as part of the group policy configuration tool that reads and writes [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) policy using the Group Policy: IP Security (IPsec) Protocol Extension [MS-GPIPSEC](#Section_dc377790742947fc9b5559589e7a586b).

<a id="gt_ipsec-client-side-plug-in"></a>
**IPsec client-side plug-in**: The [**Internet Protocol security (IPsec)**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) extension plug-in that operates on the client machine to retrieve the policy using the Group Policy: IP Security (IPsec) Protocol Extension [MS-GPIPSEC].

<a id="gt_ipsec-component"></a>
**IPsec component**: The implementation of the [**Internet Protocol security (IPsec)**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec)/[**Internet Key Exchange (IKE)**](#gt_internet-key-exchange-ike) functionality on a client machine. This is the component that the Group Policy: IP Security (IPsec) Protocol Extension [MS-GPIPSEC] configures with the [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec)/[**IKE**](#gt_internet-key-exchange-ike) policy that is transferred as part of the protocol.

<a id="gt_main-mode-mm"></a>
**main mode (MM)**: The first phase of an [**Internet Key Exchange (IKE)**](#gt_internet-key-exchange-ike) negotiation that performs authentication and negotiates a main mode security association (MM SA) between the peers. For more information, see [RFC2409] section 5.

<a id="gt_negotiation-filter-association-nfa"></a>
**negotiation filter association (NFA)**: A term that is used to describe the logical binding together of the appropriate IPsec filter and IPsec negotiation policy settings for an IPsec policy.

<a id="gt_security-association-sa"></a>
**security association (SA)**: A simplex "connection" that provides security services to the traffic carried by it. See [[RFC4301]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90465) for more information.

<a id="gt_tool-extension-guid-or-administrative-plug-in-guid"></a>
**tool extension GUID or administrative plug-in GUID**: A GUID defined separately for each of the user policy settings and computer policy settings that associates a specific administrative tool plug-in with a set of policy settings that can be stored in a [**Group Policy Object (GPO)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo).

<a id="gt_transmission-control-protocol-tcp"></a>
**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: A protocol used with the Internet Protocol (IP) to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. TCP handles keeping track of the individual units of data (called packets) that a message is divided into for efficient routing through the Internet.

<a id="gt_tunnel-mode"></a>
**tunnel mode**: An IP encapsulation mechanism, as specified in [RFC4301], that provides Internet Protocol security (IPsec) security to tunneled IP packets. IPsec processing is performed by the tunnel endpoints, which can be (but are typically not) the end hosts.

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world. The [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) standard [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16 BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

<a id="gt_user-datagram-protocol-udp"></a>

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

The Group Policy: IPsec Protocol allows administrators to arbitrarily instruct large groups of client machines to configure their local [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec)/[**IKE**](#gt_internet-key-exchange-ike) components to provide basic IP traffic filtering, IP data integrity, and optionally, IP data encryption.

This allows administrators to configure client machines to block, permit, or secure (using IPsec) IP traffic, which enables the configuration of IP network isolation, for example server isolation and [**domain**](#gt_domain) isolation as described in [[MSFT-ISOLATION-1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90188).

<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 Background

The Group Policy: Core Protocol as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 1.3, "Overview" allows clients to discover and retrieve policy settings that are created by administrators of a [**domain**](#gt_domain). These settings are persisted in [**Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo), which are assigned to "policy target" accounts in [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory). For IPsec configuration, policy target accounts are computer accounts in Active Directory. Each client uses the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to determine what GPOs are applicable to it by consulting Active Directory objects that correspond to its computer account.

On each client, each GPO is interpreted and acted on by software components known as client-side plug-ins. The client-side plug-ins that are responsible for a specific GPO are specified by using an attribute on the GPO. This attribute specifies a list of [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) pairs. The first GUID of each pair is referred to as a [**client-side extension GUID (CSE GUID)**](#gt_client-side-extension-guid-cse-guid). The second GUID of each pair is referred to as a [**tool extension GUID**](#gt_88ad7745-bee6-47f7-ae98-6fac7c5ef330).

For each GPO that is applicable to a client, the client consults the CSE GUIDs that are listed in the GPO to determine which client-side plug-ins on the client will handle the GPO. The client then invokes the client-side plug-ins to handle the GPO.

A client-side plug-in uses the contents of the GPO to retrieve class-specific settings in a manner that is specific to its class. After its class-specific settings are retrieved, the client-side plug-in uses those settings to perform class-specific processing.

### 1.3.2 IPsec Protocol Overview

The following figure shows the components that use the Group Policy: IPsec Protocol.

![Components that use the Group Policy: IPsec Protocol Extension](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Components that use the Group Policy: IPsec Protocol Extension

The components in the protocol are as follows:

- An [**IPsec administrative plug-in**](#gt_ipsec-administrative-plug-in) (computer policy settings) that is used to author and upload policy settings.
- A generic [**binary large object (BLOB)**](#gt_binary-large-object-blob) store with no protocol-specific knowledge (in this case, Active Directory).
- A client machine with an [**IPsec client-side plug-in**](#gt_ipsec-client-side-plug-in).
The [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) client-side plug-in locates the policy stores in the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) store to retrieve policy information (see details in sections [3.2.5.1](#Section_3.2.5.1) and [3.2.5.3](#Section_3.2.5.3)). Then, the IPsec client-side plug-in reads and applies policies, as specified in sections 3.2.5.1 and [3.2.5.4](#Section_3.2.5.4).

Policy information is authored in the IPsec administrative plug-in and is sent to a generic store (in this case, the Active Directory store). The policy data is generated by an IPsec policy administrator through an IPsec authoring user interface. The administrator creates one or more IPsec policies and assigns a single policy to a group of managed machines using a [**GPO**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo).

The IPsec policy creation uses the LDAP "add" mechanism, as specified in [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325) section 4.7. For details, see Message Syntax (section [2.2](#Section_2.2)).

![IPsec policy creation](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: IPsec policy creation

The IPsec policy modification (for example, when changing an IPsec policy object name or reference GUID) uses the LDAP "modify" mechanism, as specified in [RFC2251] section 4.6. For details, see Message Syntax (section 2.2).

![IPsec policy modification](media/image3.png)

Figure 3: IPsec policy modification

A client obtains the IPsec policy in three steps:

- A client-side Group Policy protocol client polls the store to discover the existence of a new policy. When a new or changed IPsec policy is detected, it signals the IPsec client-side plug-in that an IPsec policy change has occurred and provides an LDAP path to the assigned policy, as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 1.3.3.
- The IPsec client-side plug-in reads the LDAP path that specifies the assigned policy location as an LDAP path reference that specifies the assigned IPsec policy details.
- The IPsec policy detail LDAP path is then used by the IPsec client-side plug-in to read and interpret the assigned IPsec policy settings so that the IPsec policy settings can be enacted on the local system.
The details of the actual individual settings that are transferred by this protocol are specified in IPsec Policy Creation/Modification (section [2.2.1](#Section_4.1.1)), because the relevant behavior is not part of the Group Policy: Core Protocol or its extensions, but rather of the Group Policy: IPsec Protocol. These details are included to enable a client to successfully read and interpret the IPsec policy data and understand the protocol.

IPsec policy retrieval uses the LDAP search functionality, as specified in [RFC2251] section 4.5, and in sections 3.2.5.3 and 3.2.5.4.

## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Group Policy: IP Security (IPsec) Protocol Extension depends on the Group Policy: Core Protocol [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) to read and write IPsec policy ( [[RFC2401]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90341), [[RFC2402]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90342), [[RFC2406]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90346), [[RFC2410]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90350), and [[RFC2411]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90351)) on applicable Group Policy Objects (GPOs). The [**administrative plug-in**](#gt_ipsec-administrative-plug-in) for this protocol uses LDAP [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325) to read and write protocol-specific data. The protocol also relies on the DC locator operation (see [MS-NRPC](../MS-NRPC/MS-NRPC.md) section 3.5.4.3, "DC Location Methods") to locate a server from which to download the policy. These relationships are illustrated in this section.

The Group Policy IPsec Protocol Extension also uses the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol ([**ISAKMP**](#gt_internet-security-association-and-key-management-protocol-isakmp)), ([[RFC2407]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90347) and [[RFC2408]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90348)), OAKLEY ([[RFC2412]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90352)), and Internet Key Exchange ([**IKE**](#gt_internet-key-exchange-ike)), as defined in [[RFC2409]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90349) and [[RFC3947]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90448).

The following figure illustrates the relationship of the Group Policy: IP Security (IPsec) Protocol Extension to other protocols and the DC locator process.

## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The prerequisites for this protocol are the same as for the Group Policy: Core Protocol, [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 1.5.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Group Policy: IPsec Protocol is applicable only in the [**Group Policy**](#gt_group-policy) framework. Data values that are interpreted differently depending on the implementation are noted in the specific data model descriptions. Systems receiving the policy data are required to ignore information that they do not understand.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

There is no mechanism in the Group Policy: IPsec Protocol for versioning or capability negotiation. If new functionality is required that would be incompatible with the existing protocol, implement a new Group Policy protocol.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

This protocol defines values for the [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) [**client-side extension GUID**](#gt_client-side-extension-guid-cse-guid) and IPsec administrative extension [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid), as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 1.8, "Vendor-Extensible Fields". The assignments are as follows (note that the GUIDs are specified as their string representations).

## 2.1 Transport

The Group Policy: IPsec Protocol uses the LDAP protocol, as specified in [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325), to read and write data to the remote [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) data store.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

The messages are in the following three categories:

- IPsec policy creation/modification
- IPsec policy assignment
- IPsec policy retrieval
These categories are explained in the following subsections.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 IPsec Policy Creation/Modification

This section specifies how the [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) [**Group Policy**](#gt_group-policy) [**administrative plug-in**](#gt_ipsec-administrative-plug-in) creates and modifies an IPsec policy that is stored in [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory).

This section also provides background information that is needed to understand the storage of IPsec policy settings that are contained both within [**Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) and the IPsec policy data that is contained within an IPsec-specific Active Directory data store. It also specifies how individual IPsec policy data items are written and modified in a generic policy store (in this case, Active Directory).

The following figure specifies the IPsec policy storage. IPsec policy storage deviates from the typical Group Policy storage mechanism as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) by storing the IPsec policy data separately from the GPO. The GPO contains a reference to the actual IPsec policy that is assigned to the policy target accounts, as specified in [MS-GPOL] section 1.3.3, "Policy Application".

An IPsec policy is created by writing the appropriate IPsec policy attributes to the "*System\IP Security*" container. The policy can then be assigned by writing a "reference" to the policy data in the "*System\Policies\GPO-GUID\Machine\Microsoft\Windows\IPSEC*" container. Note that the GPO_[**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) text MUST be replaced by a [**curly braced GUID string**](#gt_curly-braced-guid-string) ([MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.3.4.3, "GUID--Curly Braced String Representation") that identifies the GPO.

The reference of the policy that is assigned to a GPO MUST be stored in the "*Machine\Microsoft\Windows*" container in the IPSEC object of the GPO for this Group Policy protocol. IPsec Policy Assignment is specified in section [2.2.2](#Section_3.1.5.8).

![IPsec policy storage](media/image6.png)

Figure 6: IPsec policy storage

The actual IPsec policy creation and modification protocol consists of writing a series of messages that create or modify the *ipsecPolicy*, *ipsecISAKMPPolicy*, *ipsecNFA*, *ipsecNegotiationPolicy*, and *ipsecFilter* entries (and the associated attributes as specified in [MS-ADSC](../MS-ADSC/MS-ADSC.md) section 2.71, "Class ipsecFilter", [MS-ADSC] section 2.72, "Class ipsecISAKMPPolicy", [MS-ADSC] section 2.73, "Class ipsecNegotiationPolicy", [MS-ADSC] section 2.74, "Class ipsecNFA", and [MS-ADSC] section 2.75, "Class ipsecPolicy") to the "*System\IP Security*" container. IPsec policy creation uses 'addRequest' messages that conform with [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325) section 4.1.1. IPsec policy modification uses 'modifyRequest' messages that conform with [RFC2251] section 4.1.1.

All attributes MUST be present and correctly formatted to specify an IPsec policy. There is no restriction on the order in which the values are written. The individual policy objects MUST be stored in the "*IP Security*" container, as the following figure shows.

![Individual policy objects stored in the IP Security container](media/image7.png)

Figure 7: Individual policy objects stored in the IP Security container

IPsec policy creation MUST use the addRequest when adding the policy. The individual values are specified in the data descriptions that follow in sections [2.2.1.1](#Section_2.2.1.1), [2.2.1.2](#Section_2.2.1.2), [2.2.1.3](#Section_2.2.1.3), [2.2.1.4](#Section_2.2.1.4), and [2.2.1.5](#Section_2.2.1.5).

IPsec policy modification MUST use the "replace" operation of modifyRequest when writing policies to enable "update-to" values representing the policy. The individual values are specified in the data descriptions that follow in sections 2.2.1.1, 2.2.1.2, 2.2.1.3, 2.2.1.4, and 2.2.1.5.

The individual objects in a single policy MUST be organized into a logical hierarchy. The hierarchy is defined by individual data object attributes (as specified in sections 2.2.1.1, 2.2.1.2, 2.2.1.3, 2.2.1.4, and 2.2.1.5). A complete IPsec policy consists of five hierarchical data objects, as shown in the following figure. Each IPsec policy instance MUST have one of each policy type. The diagram depicts the required policy items and logical hierarchy.

The individual items are all stored in the "*IP Security*" container, and the relationships shown are logical, not physical. A logical relationship is formed by an attribute of one item having as a value the name of another item.

![Required policy items and logical hierarchy for a complete IPsec policy](media/image8.png)

Figure 8: Required policy items and logical hierarchy for a complete IPsec policy

To create a complete IPsec policy, object creation and modification can be implemented in the following order:

- Create ipsecPolicy.
- Create ipsecISAKMPPolicy.
- Create ipsecNFA.
- Create ipsecNegotiationPolicy.
- Create ipsecFilter.
- Modify ipsecPolicy - with ipsecISAKMPReference ipsecNFAReference.
- Modify ipsecNFA - with ipsecFilterReference ipsecNegotiationPolicyReference.
**Note** In practice, the policy structure might not be as simple as the preceding diagram suggests because multiple ipsecNFA objects can (and usually do) exist per ipsecPolicy. For example, consider two ipsecFilter objects, two ipsecNegotiationPolicy objects, and three different ipsecNFA objects. In this example, these objects are denoted as F1, F2; NegPol1, NegPol2; and NFA1, NFA2, and NFA3 respectively. Note that NFA1 can reference F1 and NegPol1, and NFA2 can reference F2 and NegPol2. Then, a single ipsecPolicy can reference both NFA1 and NFA2. These relationships are illustrated in the following figure.

![Multiple ipsecNFA objects per ipsecPolicy](media/image9.png)

Figure 9: Multiple ipsecNFA objects per ipsecPolicy

**Note** Multiple ipsecPolicy objects can be stored in the "*IP Security*" container. Separate policies (ipsecPolicy objects) are often assigned as active policy to particular GPOs, so that a specific IPsec policy can be applied to a group of machines that have a common need.

The following explains the cardinality of object associations:

- Each ipsecPolicy object can be associated to one or more ipsecNFA objects. Each ipsecNFA object can be associated to a maximum of one ipsecPolicy object.
- Each ipsecISAKMPPolicy object can be associated to one ipsecPolicy object. Each ipsecPolicy object can be associated to a maximum of one ipsecISAKMPPolicy object.
- Each ipsecNegotiationPolicy object can be associated to zero or more ipsecNFA objects. Each ipsecNFA object can be associated to a maximum of one ipsecNegotiationPolicy object.
- Each ipsecFilter object can be associated to zero or more ipsecNFA objects. Each ipsecNFA object can be associated to one or more ipsecFilter objects.

#### 2.2.1.1 ipsecPolicy Object Attribute Details

[**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) policy is the main unit of a single policy instance. The **ipsecPolicy** data attribute contains this IPsec policy information. It MUST contain a reference to an [**ISAKMP**](#gt_internet-security-association-and-key-management-protocol-isakmp) policy, at least one reference to a [**negotiation filter association (NFA)**](#gt_negotiation-filter-association-nfa) policy, and other miscellaneous IPsec policy settings. The following figure shows an IPsec policy object.

IPsec policy creation MUST use the LDAP add functionality in conformance with [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325) section 4.7.

IPsec policy modification MUST use the LDAP modify functionality in conformance with [RFC2251] section 4.6.

<a id="Section_2.2.1.1.1"></a>
##### 2.2.1.1.1 ipsecPolicy{GUID} Object Attribute Descriptions

The following table specifies the attributes of the ipsecPolicy class object (as specified in [MS-ADSC](../MS-ADSC/MS-ADSC.md), [MS-ADA1](../MS-ADA1/MS-ADA1.md), and [MS-ADA3](../MS-ADA3/MS-ADA3.md)).

The types used in the following (and subsequent) tables are defined as follows: "*LDAPString*" as defined in [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325) section 4.1.2; "*UTC Coded String*" defined as an LDAPString containing the generalized time syntax of the form *YYYYMMDDHHMMSS[.|,fraction][(+|-HHMM)|Z]*, where Z means UTC; "*Distinguished Name*" as defined in [RFC2251] section 4.1.3; and "*Octet String*" as defined in [RFC2251] section 4.1.2.

This attribute is not used during ipsecPolicy creation; it is only used during modification. |
| ipsecNFAReference | A list of distinguished names | A list of Directory String references to the ipsecNFA objects that are associated with this ipsecPolicy object. The list MUST be composed of DNs in the format specified in [RFC2251]. The separator between two DNs is 2 bytes of 0. For example: DN1-2bytesof0-DN2, where DN1 and DN2 are distinguished names. There can be multiple [**NFA**](#gt_negotiation-filter-association-nfa) references present; each NFA reference is a NULL-terminated DN. A typical value is like the following: "*CN=ipsecNFA{6A1E5C3F-72B7-11D2-ACF0-0260B025CAFE },CN=IP Security, CN=System,DC=myDomain, DC=contoso,DC=com*".

<a id="Section_2.2.1.2"></a>
#### 2.2.1.2 ipsecISAKMPPolicy Object Attribute Details

The [**ISAKMP**](#gt_internet-security-association-and-key-management-protocol-isakmp) policy stores information related to the initial [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) conversation (that is, [**main mode (MM)**](#gt_main-mode-mm); as defined in [[RFC2408]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90348) and [[RFC2409]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90349), section 7.1). The **ipsecISAKMPPolicy** data attribute contains this ISAKMP policy information.

The ISAKMP policy includes settings for establishing a [**security association (SA)**](#gt_security-association-sa) and cryptographic keys with a remote peer. It also stores [**IKE**](#gt_internet-key-exchange-ike) settings that it uses to exchange keys with the IPsec peer.

The following diagram shows the ISAKMP policy object.

![ISAKMP policy object](media/image11.png)

Figure 11: ISAKMP policy object

**Note** The ipsecISAKMPPolicy object ([MS-ADSC] section 2.72, "Class ipsecISAKMPPolicy") as specified in LDAP messages, is encoded using BER, as defined in [RFC2251] section 5.1.

The following table specifies the **ipsecData** attribute-specific sections, corresponding names, and data types for the assigned values for the purpose of [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) policy configuration.

The values of these settings MUST NOT be interpreted by this protocol; that is, they are to be applied as is to the IPsec component, which can interpret them independently of the protocol or mechanism that was used to configure them. A description of the interpretation by the IPsec component is provided for informative purposes (as opposed to the syntax, which is normative).

Note that all fields specified in the following tables MUST appear in little-endian byte order.

#### 2.2.1.3 ipsecNFA Object Attribute Details

The [**NFA**](#gt_negotiation-filter-association-nfa) policy stores references to a Filter List policy and a Negotiation policy to bind the individual Filter and Negotiation policy objects together. The **ipsecNFA** data attribute contains this policy binding information. It also stores additional [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) settings, such as authentication methods and [**tunnel mode**](#gt_tunnel-mode) configuration. The following diagram shows an NFA policy object.

![NFA policy object](media/image12.png)

```

**IP-Address (16 bytes):** The IP address of the traffic that defines the IPsec filter. If the **IPsec-Address-Version** field is 0x0001, this is the 4-byte (network byte order) representation of an IPv4 address (the remaining 12 bytes are not significant). If the **IPsec-Address-Version** field is 0x0002, this is the 16-byte (network byte order) representation of an IPv6 address. On reading, if the **IPsec-Address-Version** field is equal to 0x0003, the 16 bytes of the **IP-Address** field MUST be ignored. On writing, if the **IPsec-Address-Version** field is equal to 0x0003, the 16 bytes of the **IP-Address** field MUST be set to 0.

If the **IPsec-Address-Version** field is 0x0002, this is the 16-byte (network byte order) representation of an IPv6 address. Note that this field is only significant if the **IPsec-Address-Type** field is 0x0002 or 0x0004. If the **IPsec-Address-Type** field is 0x0002, this defines the last address in the applicable range of IP addresses for this filter. If the **IPsec-Address-Type** field is 0x0004, this defines the subnet mask for this filter. When a subnet filter is defined: if the **IPsec-Address-Version** field is 0x0001, this is the 4-byte (network byte order) representation of the IPv4 subnet mask; if the **IPsec-Address-Version** field is 0x0002, this is the 1-byte representation of the IPv6 subnet mask.

### 2.2.2 IPsec Policy Assignment

This section specifies how an [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) [**Group Policy**](#gt_group-policy) [**administrative plug-in**](#gt_ipsec-administrative-plug-in) assigns an active IPsec policy to a [**GPO**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo).

The active IPsec policy MUST be assigned to a GPO by writing to the ipsecOwnersReference attribute, as specified in [MS-ADA1](../MS-ADA1/MS-ADA1.md) section 2.330, "Attribute ipsecOwnersReference", of the assigned GPO "*Machine\Microsoft\Windows\IPSEC*" data object. The ipsecOwnersReference value MUST be a reference to the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) location of the assigned IPsec policy that MUST be stored in the System\IP Security container as shown in the following diagram.

![Location of the ipsecOwnersReference value\System\IP Security container](media/image15.png)

Figure 15: Location of the ipsecOwnersReference value\System\IP Security container

Two additional values MUST be written to the IPsec object to name and describe the assigned policy; they are the ipsecName and Description values as specified in [MS-ADA1].

The following table specifies the expected contents of the IPSEC object as specified by [MS-ADA1].

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ipsecOwnersReference | Distinguished name | The [**Directory String**](#gt_directory-string) that represents the LDAP reference to the location (in Active Directory) of the policy that is currently assigned to the GPO. This MUST be in the [**distinguished name (DN)**](#gt_distinguished-name-dn) format of [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325). |
| ipsecName | LDAPString | An optional user-defined Directory String that names the currently assigned policy. This is intended for display purposes only. |
| description | LDAPString | An optional user-defined Directory String that describes the currently-assigned policy. This is intended for display purposes only. |

To assign an active IPsec policy, the LDAP portion of the message is an LDAP addRequest as specified in [RFC2251] section 4.7.

The following table specifies the values for Entry and attributes parameters, as applicable to LDAP addRequest messages.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Entry | The IPSEC object distinguished name for the GPO: cn=ipsec,cn=Windows,cn=Microsoft,cn=Machine,cn={GPO GUID},cn=policies,cn=system,<domain naming context>. |
| attributes | This field MUST specify the Active Directory object class: objectClass=ipsecPolicy. |

If the **resultCode** field of the "AddResponse" message ([RFC2251] section 4.7) is nonzero, the add operation failed and this protocol sequence MUST log an error.

To modify an already assigned IPsec policy, the LDAP portion of the message is an LDAP modifyRequest (that MUST specify the replace operation) as specified in [RFC2251] section 4.6.

The following table specifies the values for Entry and attributes parameters, as applicable to LDAP modifyRequest messages.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Entry | The IPSEC object distinguished name (DN) for the GPO: cn=ipsec,cn=Windows,cn=Microsoft,cn=Machine,cn={GPO GUID},cn=policies,cn=system,<domain naming context>. |
| attributes | This field MUST specify the **ipsecOwnersReference** attribute. The **ipsecOwnersReference** value MUST be CN=ipsecPolicy{GUID},CN=IP Security,CN=System,<domain naming context>. It MUST also specify any additional/optional attributes that are set on the object, such as the **ipsecName** and **description** attributes. If an optional attribute is not set on the object, that attribute MUST NOT be included in the LDAP modifyRequest message. |

If the **resultCode** field of the "ModifyResponse" message ([RFC2251] section 4.6) is nonzero, the modify operation failed and this protocol sequence MUST log an error.

# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 IPsec Group Policy Administrative Plug-in Details

The [**IPsec administrative plug-in**](#gt_ipsec-administrative-plug-in) consists of a user interface that allows an [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) administrator to author an IPsec policy and assign it to a [**GPO**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo). First, the values that are entered by the administrator are used to form IPsec creation/modification messages as specified in IPsec Policy Creation/Modification (section [2.2.1](#Section_4.1.1)) and IPsec policy assignment messages, as specified in IPsec Policy Assignment (section [2.2.2](#Section_3.1.5.8)). These messages are then sent to [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) and stored as the IPsec policy, as explained in IPsec Extension Overview (section [1.3.2](#Section_1.3.2)).

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section specifies a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation can maintain to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

For state, the plug-in simply maintains the list of <name of setting, value of setting> pairs for the settings specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2), "Message Syntax", that are suitable for displaying in the user interface.

**ADConnectionHandle:** An **ADConnection** structure (see "ADConnection Abstract Data Model", in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 7.3) of type **ADCONNECTION_HANDLE** (see [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.2.2, "ADCONNECTION_HANDLE") that tracks a connection to an Active Directory server.

Note that an **ADCONNECTION_HANDLE** object is returned by the **ADConnection** initialization operation, as defined in section [3.2.5.2](#Section_3.2.5.2).

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

When the [**IPsec administrative plug-in**](#gt_ipsec-administrative-plug-in) starts, the [**Group Policy**](#gt_group-policy) Protocol component (as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) (section 1.3.3.1), "Server Discovery and Group Policy Object Association" and [MS-GPOL] (section 1.3.3.2), "GPO Retrieval") gives it an LDAP path (as defined in [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325)) that identifies the [**GPO**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) path that contains the [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) policy. The plug-in MUST then use this path to read the current active policy (if any) from the GPO path by using the messages specified in section [3.2.5.3](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md).

The IPsec administrative plug-in MUST then retrieve the details of the IPsec policy objects that are currently available for assignment to the GPO from the IP Security [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) container, as specified in section [3.2.5.4](#Section_3.2.5.4). If this fails, administrators MUST be informed so that they can determine the appropriate action to take.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

The higher-layer triggered events are: policy creation, policy modification, policy deletion, reading the policy, and assigning the policy to a GPO.

The administrator triggers each of these events by using the administrative plug-in.

On the policy creation/modify, the IPsec Protocol plug-in MUST generate the messages to create or modify the IPsec policy in the Active Directory store, as specified in IPsec Policy Creation/Modification (section [2.2.1](#Section_4.1.1)).

On policy reading, the IPsec Protocol plug-in MUST generate the messages specified in section [3.1.5.4](#Section_3.1.5.4).

On policy deleting, the IPsec Protocol plug in MUST generate the messages specified in section [3.1.5.7](#Section_3.1.5.7).

For assigning policy to a GPO, the IPsec Protocol plug-in MUST generated the messages as specified in section [3.1.5.8](#Section_3.1.5.8).

In all cases, if this fails, the administrator MUST be informed so that they can determine the appropriate action to take.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>
#### 3.1.5.1 Configuring an LDAP BindRequest

The following protocol sequences MUST be generated by the administrative plug-in.

**To configure an LDAP BindRequest:**

- Binding MUST be handled by passing abstract element ADConnectionHandle to [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 7.6.1.4.
- If the TaskReturnStatus does not indicate success (0), then the administrative plug-in MUST log an error and MUST terminate policy reading.
<a id="Section_3.1.5.2"></a>
#### 3.1.5.2 Terminating the LDAP BindRequest

To close the connection opened by a previous LDAP BindRequest, the administrative plug-in MUST unbind as specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 7.6.1.5. The administrative plug-in MUST pass its ADConnectionHandle as a parameter to the unbind task.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.3"></a>
#### 3.1.5.3 Retrieving the Assigned Policy Location, Name, and Description

The administrative plug-in MUST connect to the domain controller as specified in sections [3.2.5.1](#Section_3.2.5.1) and [3.2.5.2](#Section_3.2.5.2). The administrative plug-in MUST retrieve the assigned policy location, name, and description, as specified in section [3.2.5.3](#Section_3.2.5.3). Thereafter, terminate the BindRequest, as defined in section [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2).

The administrative plug-in MUST connect to the domain controller as specified in section [3.2.5.1](#Section_3.2.5.1) and [3.2.5.2](#Section_3.2.5.2). The administrative plug-in MUST read the existing group policy, using the appropriate parameters and values, as specified in sections [3.2.5.3](#Section_3.2.5.3) and [3.2.5.4](#Section_3.2.5.4). Thereafter, terminate the LDAP BindRequest, as specified in section [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2).

<a id="Section_3.1.5.5"></a>
#### 3.1.5.5 Writing the Assigned Policy Data

The administrative plug-in MUST connect to the domain controller as specified in sections [3.2.5.1](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) and [3.2.5.2](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md). To write the new IPsec policy, the administrative plug-in MUST perform the LDAP operation specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 7.6.1.6, "Performing an LDAP Operation on an ADConnection". The TaskInputADConnection value MUST be the ADCONNECTION_HANDLE object ([MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.2.2, "ADCONNECTION_HANDLE") stored in **ADConnectionHandle**. The TaskInputRequestMessage MUST contain an LDAP AddRequest message ([[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325) section 4.7) with the following parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Entry | The value for this parameter MUST be CN=ObjectPath, CN=IP Security, CN=System, DN for the root of the domain; where objectpath is ipsecfilter{Guid} (section [2.2.1.5](#Section_2.2.1.5)), ipsecISAKMPPolicy{Guid} (section [2.2.1.2](#Section_2.2.1.2)), ipsecNegotiationPolicy{Guid} (section [2.2.1.4](#Section_2.2.1.4)), IPsecNFA{Guid} (section [2.2.1.3](#Section_2.2.1.3)), or IpsecPolicy{Guid} (section [2.2.1.1](#Section_2.2.1.1)). |
| Attributes | This field MUST specify the following attributes (sections 2.2.1.1, 2.2.1.2, 2.2.1.3, 2.2.1.4, and 2.2.1.5): For all objects ipsecfilter{Guid}, ipsecISAKMPPolicy{Guid}, ipsecNegotiationPolicy{Guid}, IPsecNFA{Guid}, IpsecPolicy{Guid}: **objectClass** **ipsecName** **ipsecID** **distinguishedName** **description** **ipsecData** **ipsecDataType** For ipsecISAKMPPolicy{Guid}: **ipsecOwnersReference** For ipsecfilter{Guid}: **ipsecOwnersReference** For ipsecNegotiationPolicy{Guid}: **ipsecOwnersReference** **ipsecNegotiationPolicyAction** **ipsecNegotiationPolicyType** For IPsecNFA{Guid}: **ipsecOwnersReference** |

The administrative plug-in waits for a response. If the TaskReturnStatus does not signal success (0), then the administrative plug-in MUST log an error, and then unbind as specified in section [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2).

**Note** When writing the new IPsec policy is complete, terminate the BindRequest as specified in section 3.1.5.2.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.6"></a>
#### 3.1.5.6 Modifying the Assigned Policy Data

The administrative plug-in MUST connect to the domain controller as specified in sections [3.2.5.1](#Section_3.2.5.1) and [3.2.5.2](#Section_3.2.5.2). To modify the policy, the administrative-side plug-in modifies the existing policy object in [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory).

To accomplish this, an LDAP operation MUST be performed, as specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 7.6.1.6, "Performing an LDAP Operation on an ADConnection". The TaskInputADConnection value MUST be the ADCONNECTION_HANDLE object ([MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md), section 2.2.2, "ADCONNECTION_HANDLE") stored in **ADConnectionHandle**. The TaskInputRequestMessage MUST contain an LDAP ModifyRequest message ([[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325) section 4.6) with the following parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Entry | The value for this parameter MUST be CN=ObjectPath, CN=IP Security, CN=System, DN for the root of the domain; where ObjectPath is ipsecfilter{Guid} (section [2.2.1.5](#Section_2.2.1.5)), ipsecISAKMPPolicy{Guid} (section [2.2.1.2](#Section_2.2.1.2)), ipsecNegotiationPolicy{Guid} (section [2.2.1.4](#Section_2.2.1.4)) IPsecNFA{Guid} (section [2.2.1.3](#Section_2.2.1.3)), or IpsecPolicy{Guid} (section [2.2.1.1](#Section_2.2.1.1)). |
| Attributes | This field MUST specify any or all of the following attributes (sections 2.2.1.1, 2.2.1.2, 2.2.1.3, 2.2.1.4, and 2.2.1.5): For all objects: **ipsecData** **ipsecDataType** For IpsecPolicy{Guid} objects: **ipsecISAKMPReference** **ipsecNFAReference** For IPsecNFA{Guid} objects: **ipsecFilterReference** **ipsecNegotiationPolicyReference** For ipsecFilter{Guid}, ipsecNegotiationPolicy{Guid}, and ipsecISAKMPPolicy{Guid} objects: ipsecOwnersReference |

The administrative plug-in waits for a response. If the TaskReturnStatus does not signal success (0), then the administrative plug-in MUST log an error, and then unbind as specified in section [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2).

**Note** To terminate the LDAP BindRequest and close the connection, the administrative plug-in MUST make an LDAP UnBindRequest corresponding to the LDAP BindRequest, as indicated in section 3.1.5.2.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.7"></a>
#### 3.1.5.7 Deleting the Assigned Policy Data

To delete an existing object, the administrative plug-in MUST connect to the domain controller as specified in sections [3.2.5.1](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) and [3.2.5.2](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md). The administrative-side plug-in MUST delete the existing object in the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) that contains the particular IPsec settings. To accomplish this, an LDAP operation MUST be performed, as specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md), section 7.6.1.6, "Performing an LDAP Operation on an ADConnection". The TaskInputADConnection value MUST be the ADCONNECTION_HANDLE object ([MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md), section 2.2.2, "ADCONNECTION_HANDLE") stored in **ADConnectionHandle**. The TaskInputRequestMessage MUST contain an LDAP delRequest message ([[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325) section 4.8) with the following parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Entry | The value for this parameter MUST be CN=ObjectPath, CN=IP Security, CN=System, DN for the root of the domain; where ObjectPath is ipsecfilter{Guid} (section [2.2.1.5](#Section_2.2.1.5)), ipsecISAKMPPolicy{Guid} (section [2.2.1.2](#Section_2.2.1.2)), ipsecNegotiationPolicy{Guid} (section [2.2.1.4](#Section_2.2.1.4)), IPsecNFA{Guid} (section [2.2.1.3](#Section_2.2.1.3)), or IpsecPolicy{Guid} (section [2.2.1.1](#Section_2.2.1.1)). |

The administrative plug-in waits for a response. If the TaskReturnStatus does not signal success (0), the administrative plug-in MUST log an error, and then unbind as specified in section [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2).

**Note** This message deletes the existing Active Directory object for the corresponding policy. To terminate the LDAP BindRequest and close the connection, the administrative plug-in MUST make an LDAP UnBindRequest corresponding to the initial LDAP BindRequest (section 3.1.5.2).

When deleting an object, the administrative plug-in MUST fail the delete (and report an error back to the user) if there are outstanding references to the object being deleted in the following cases:

- On attempting to delete an ipsecFilter, if any IPsecNFA object references that filter object, the delete MUST fail. Deleting an ipsecFilter MUST NOT modify any existing IPsecNFA objects.
- On attempting to delete an ipsecNegotiationPolicy object, if any IPsecNFA object references that policy object, the delete MUST fail. Deleting an ipsecNegotiationPolicy object MUST NOT modify any existing IPsecNFA objects.
- On attempting to delete an ipsecISAKMPPolicy object, if any ipsecPolicy object references that ipsecISAKMPPolicy object, the delete MUST fail. Deleting an ipsecISAKMPPolicy object MUST NOT modify any existing ipsecPolicy objects.
On deleting an IPsecNFA object, the order of operations MUST be as follows:

- The ipsecNFAReference value MUST be updated to remove the reference to the deleted NFA from any ipsecPolicy objects that reference the deleted IPsecNFA object. On failure, the delete operation MUST be terminated and an error logged.
- The IPsecNFA reference in the ipsecOwnersReference of the ipsecNegotiationPolicy object MUST be deleted. On failure, the delete operation MUST be terminated and an error logged.
- The IPsecNFA reference in the ipsecOwnersReference of the ipsecFilter(s) object MUST be deleted. On failure, the delete operation MUST be terminated and an error logged.
- The IPsecNFA object MUST be deleted. On failure, the delete operation MUST be terminated and an error logged.
On deleting an ipsecPolicy object, the order of operations is as follows:

- All IPsecNFA objects associated with the ipsecPolicy object MUST first be deleted. On failure, the delete operation MUST be terminated and an error logged.
- The **ipsecOwnersReference** field of the ipsecISAKMPPolicy object that is referenced by the deleted ipsecPolicy object MUST be updated to remove the reference to the deleted ipsecPolicy object. On failure, the error MUST be ignored and the delete operation continued.
- The ipsecPolicy object MUST be deleted. On failure, an error MUST be logged.
- If the newly deleted ipsecPolicy object is currently assigned (as specified in section [3.1.5.8](#Section_3.1.5.8)), the assigned policy location **ipsecOwnersReference**, **description**, and **ipsecName** MAY<30> be updated to remove the reference to the newly deleted policy object.
All reference modification MUST be done as specified in section [3.1.5.6](#Section_3.1.5.6). Object deletion MUST be done as specified in this section.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.8"></a>
#### 3.1.5.8 Policy Assignment

The **Policy Assignment** event is invoked to assign an ipsecPolicy object to a GPO.

The parameters to the **Policy Assignment** event are as follows.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| GPO Path | A string containing the [**distinguished name (DN)**](#gt_distinguished-name-dn) of the GPO to which the ipsecPolicy object is being assigned |
| ipsecOwnersReference | A string containing the DN of the ipsecPolicy object being assigned |
| ipsecName | A string containing the name of the policy being assigned |
| description | A string containing a description of the policy being assigned |

To assign the policy to the GPO, the [**administrative plug-in**](#gt_ipsec-administrative-plug-in) MUST perform the following operations in order:

- The administrative plug-in MUST locate a Domain Controller as specified in section [3.2.5.1](#Section_3.2.5.1). If this operation fails, the administrative plug-in MUST stop processing the policy assignment event.
- The administrative plug-in MUST establish a connection to the Domain Controller as specified in section [3.2.5.2](#Section_3.2.5.2). If this operation fails, the administrative plug-in MUST stop processing the policy assignment event.
- The administrative plug-in MUST attempt to retrieve the assigned policy location as specified in section [3.2.5.3](#Section_3.2.5.3). The DN for the IPSEC object MUST be specified as "CN=IPSEC, CN=Windows, CN=Microsoft, <GPO path>". Note that this operation is performed only to determine if the IPSEC object already exists; the returned attributes (if any) are ignored.
- If any of the SearchRequests performed in step 3 returns a TaskReturnStatus ([MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 7.6.1.6, Performing an LDAP Operation on an ADConnection) other than success (0) or "No such object" (32), the administrative plug-in MUST terminate the BindRequest as specified in section [3.1.5.2](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) and MUST stop processing the policy assignment event.
- If all of the SearchRequests performed in step 3 return a TaskReturnStatus of success (0), the administrative plug-in MUST skip to step 7; that is, it MUST NOT send an addRequest.
- Otherwise, the administrative plug-in MUST send an LDAP addRequest as specified in section [2.2.2](#Section_3.1.5.8). If the addRequest returns a TaskReturnStatus other than success (0), that is, the addRequest fails for any reason, the administrative plug-in MUST terminate the BindRequest as specified in section 3.1.5.2 and MUST stop processing the policy assignment event.
- The administrative plug-in MUST send an LDAP modifyRequest as specified in section 2.2.2. The ipsecOwnersReference, ipsecName, and description parameters for the modifyRequest are the same as the corresponding parameters supplied to this event. If the modifyRequest returns a TaskReturnStatus other than success (0), that is, the modifyRequest fails for any reason, the administrative plug-in MUST terminate the BindRequest as specified in section 3.1.5.2 and MUST stop processing the policy assignment event.
- The administrative plug-in MUST terminate the LDAP BindRequest as specified section 3.1.5.2.
- The administrative plug-in MUST invoke the [**Group Policy extension**](#gt_group-policy-extension) Update event ([MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 3.3.4.4, Group Policy Extension Update).

## 3.2 IPsec Group Policy Client-Side Plug-in Details

During policy application, this protocol is invoked after the Group Policy: Core Protocol has computed a list of [**GPOs**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) for which the [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) client plug-in is to be invoked as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 3.2.5, "Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules".

<a id="Section_3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This section specifies a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation can maintain to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

**Local Timer Interval:** Contains the current duration in minutes of the **Local Timer** (section [3.2.2](#Section_3.2.2)). The initial value is zero.

**RetrievedDomainName:** Contains the domain name retrieved by the DC locator operation, as specified in section [3.2.5.1](#Section_3.2.5.1).

**ADConnectionHandle:** An **ADConnection** structure ([MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 7.3, "ADConnection Abstract Data Model") of type **ADCONNECTION_HANDLE** ([MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.2.2, "ADCONNECTION_HANDLE") that tracks a connection to an Active Directory server.

**Note** An **ADCONNECTION_HANDLE** object is returned by the **ADConnection** initialization operation specified in section [3.2.5.2](#Section_3.2.5.2).

**LocalWhenChanged:** A copy of the whenChanged attribute from the ipsecPolicy object (see section [2.2.1.1.1](#Section_2.2.1.1.1)) of the assigned policy.

**FilteredGPOList:** A list of new or changed GPOs since this client-side extension was last applied. Filtered GO List is defined in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 3.2.1.5.

<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

**Local Timer:** A local timer controls the time interval at which to check for [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) policy updates in the IPsec policy container.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

On initialization, the client MUST set the **LocalWhenChanged** ADM element to 0 and then execute the functionality specified in [3.2.6.1](#Section_3.2.6.1). Note that the **whenChanged** attribute in the retrieved policy will never be 0; thus, setting LocalWhenChanged to 0 will trigger the implementation to reread all the policy objects as specified in 3.2.6.1.

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

<a id="Section_3.2.4.1"></a>
#### 3.2.4.1 Processing Group Policy Callbacks

During policy application, this protocol is invoked after the Group Policy: Core Protocol has computed a list of GPOs for which the IPsec client plug-in is to be invoked, as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 3.2.5, "Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules".

This extension is launched by the Group Policy: Core Protocol by invoking the **Process Group Policy Event** as specified in [MS-GPOL], section 3.2.4.1 and section 3.2.5.1.10.

[MS-GPOL] provides the *New or Changed GPO list*, which is a list of the new or changed GPOs. It also supplies the *Deleted GPO list* and other parameters. The *Deleted GPO list* and all the other parameters supplied to the callback are ignored.

The GPOs that are assigned to the client machine are indicated in the callback in the *New or Changed GPO list*. This list of GPOs MUST be copied to the **FilteredGPOList** ADM element. The client MUST determine the location of the policy that is assigned to the client as specified by sections [3.2.5.1](#Section_3.2.5.1), [3.2.5.2](#Section_3.2.5.2), and [3.2.5.3](#Section_3.2.5.3).

Once the policy location is known, the client MUST read the policy, as specified in sections 3.2.5.1, 3.2.5.2, and [3.2.5.4](#Section_3.2.5.4).

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1"></a>
#### 3.2.5.1 Locating a Domain Controller

To locate the domain controller, the client MUST invoke the DC locator operation DsrGetDcName ([MS-NRPC](../MS-NRPC/MS-NRPC.md) section 3.5.4.3.3, "DsrGetDcName (Opnum 20)"). For this method, the input parameters are all NULL except for the *Flags* parameter, which MUST have bits B and R set ([MS-NRPC] section 3.5.4.3.1, "DsrGetDcNameEx2 (Opnum 34)").

When the DsrGetDcName method completes, store the value of the **DomainName** member from the returned **DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_INFOW** structure in the **RetrievedDomainName** data element.

**Note** The hostname, contained in the **RetrievedDomainName** data element, is resolved to an explicit IP address when connecting to the domain controller in section [3.2.5.2](#Section_3.2.5.2).

If the DsrGetDcName method fails, the client MUST increment the **Local Timer Interval** value (section [3.2.1](#Section_3.1.1)) by 1, square it, reduce it to 166 if its value is greater than 166, and then set the **Local Timer** to this new value, in minutes. Otherwise, the client MUST retrieve the assigned policy location, name, and description, as specified in section [3.2.5.3](#Section_3.2.5.3).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2"></a>
#### 3.2.5.2 Establishing a Connection to the Domain Controller

An ADConnection initialization operation MUST be performed, as specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 7.6.1.1, "Initializing an ADConnection". The *TaskInputTargetName* input value MUST be taken from **RetrievedDomainName**, and the *TaskInputPortNumber* value MUST be 389. The resulting ADCONNECTION_HANDLE object ([MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.2.2, "ADCONNECTION_HANDLE") MUST be stored in **ADConnectionHandle**.

The following options MUST be set on the ADConnection associated with **ADConnectionHandle**, using the operation specified in [MS-ADTS] section 7.6.1.2, "Setting an LDAP Option on an ADConnection".

- LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION MUST be set to 3.
- LDAP_OPT_ENCRYPT MUST be set to TRUE.
- LDAP_OPT_SIGN MUST be set to TRUE.
An ADConnection MUST be established using the operation specified in [MS-ADTS] section 7.6.1.3, "Establishing an ADConnection". The *TaskInputADConnection* value MUST be the ADCONNECTION_HANDLE object ([MS-DTYP] section 2.2.2, "ADCONNECTION_HANDLE") stored in **ADConnectionHandle**.

Then, the connection handle MUST bind as specified in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1).

**Note** The hostname, contained in the **RetrievedDomainName** data element, is resolved to an explicit IP address in [MS-ADTS] section 7.6.1.1, "Initializing an ADConnection", and [MS-ADTS] section 7.6.1.3, "Establishing an ADConnection".

<a id="Section_3.2.5.3"></a>
#### 3.2.5.3 Retrieving the Assigned Policy Location, Name, and Description

The client MUST determine the location of the currently assigned policy by accessing the ipsecOwnersReference attribute, as specified in [MS-ADA1](../MS-ADA1/MS-ADA1.md) section 2.330, "Attribute ipsecOwnersReference", of the IPSEC object cn=ipsec,cn=Windows,cn=Microsoft,cn=Machine,<GPO DN>, for the last (highest precedence) GPO of the FilteredGPOList ADM element. The ipsecOwnersReference attribute contains the [**DN**](#gt_distinguished-name-dn) of the ipsecPolicy object that is to be applied to the client machine.

Similarly, the assigned policy name and description MUST be read by retrieving the ipsecName and description values. These values MUST be interpreted as a [**Directory String**](#gt_directory-string) (section [2.2.2](#Section_3.1.5.8)).

To retrieve the assigned IPsec policy location, name, and description for a GPO, an LDAP operation MUST be performed using the operation specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 7.6.1.6, "Performing an LDAP Operation on an ADConnection". The *TaskInputADConnection* value MUST be the ADCONNECTION_HANDLE object ([MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.2.2, "ADCONNECTION_HANDLE") stored in **ADConnectionHandle**. The TaskInputRequestMessage MUST contain an LDAP searchRequest message ([[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325) [[RFC2254]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90328)) with the values specified in section [2.2.3.1](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

The client MUST first send an LDAP SearchRequest message with the **objectClass** attribute, as specified in 2.2.3.1. If this operation succeeds, then the client MUST send an LDAP SearchRequest message with the **ipsecOwnersReference**, **ipsecName**, and **description** attributes, as specified in 2.2.3.1.

If either LDAP SearchRequest message fails, the local IPsec component MUST be signaled so that it can enter a known-safe state. Otherwise, the client MUST retrieve its assigned policy data (section [3.2.5.4](#Section_3.2.5.4)).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.4"></a>
#### 3.2.5.4 Retrieving the Assigned Policy Data

The IPsec policy data that is currently assigned is specified by the ipsecFilter, ipsecISAKMPPolicy, ipsecNegotiationPolicy, ipsecNFA, and ipsecPolicy entries, as specified in [MS-ADSC](../MS-ADSC/MS-ADSC.md) section 2.71, "Class ipsecFilter", [MS-ADSC] section 2.72, "Class ipsecISAKMPPolicy", [MS-ADSC] section 2.73, "Class ipsecNegotiationPolicy", [MS-ADSC] section 2.74, "Class ipsecNFA", and [MS-ADSC] section 2.75, "Class ipsecPolicy", respectively. Additional details are specified in sections [2.2.1.1](../MS-ADSC/MS-ADSC.md), [2.2.1.2](#Section_2.2.1.2), [2.2.1.3](#Section_2.2.1.3), [2.2.1.4](#Section_2.2.1.4), and [2.2.1.5](#Section_2.2.1.5). To retrieve the details of the assigned IPsec policy from the IPsec ("System\IP Security") container, an LDAP searchRequest message ([[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325) [[RFC2254]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90328)) with the values specified in section [2.2.3.2](../MS-ADSC/MS-ADSC.md) MUST be sent to the domain controller (located in section [3.2.5.1](../MS-ADSC/MS-ADSC.md)):

If this operation fails, the client MUST increment the **Local Timer Interval** value (section [3.2.1](#Section_3.1.1)) by 1, square it, reduce it to 166 if its value is greater than 166, and then set the **Local Timer** (section [3.2.2](#Section_3.2.2)) to this new value, in minutes. Otherwise, it MUST reset the **Local Timer** to the interval specified by the Polling-Interval value that is retrieved as part of the IPsec policy object, as specified in the messages defined in ipsecPolicy Object Attribute Details.

Any retrieved ipsecPolicy object MUST copy its **whenChanged** field (see section 2.2.1.1) to the implementation's **LocalWhenChanged** ADM element, as defined in section 3.2.1.

<a id="Section_3.2.6"></a>
### 3.2.6 Timer Events

<a id="Section_3.2.6.1"></a>
#### 3.2.6.1 Local Timer Expiration

When the **Local Timer** (section [3.2.2](#Section_3.2.2)) expires, the client MUST check for [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) policy updates in the IPsec policy container.

The client MUST locate the domain controller (section [3.2.5.1](#Section_3.2.5.1)), connect to the domain controller (section [3.2.5.2](#Section_3.2.5.2)), and retrieve the assigned policy data (section [3.2.5.4](#Section_3.2.5.4)) for the assigned ipsecPolicy object. For the newly retrieved ipsecPolicy object, the client MUST compare the whenChanged attribute (section [2.2.1.1.1](#Section_2.2.1.1.1)) against the **LocalWhenChanged** ADM element. If these values are the same, the client MUST reset the timer using the LocalTimerInterval. Otherwise, the client MUST reread all policies for all objects as defined in section 3.2.5.4.

# 4 Protocol Examples

The IT security office of Contoso, Ltd (contoso.com) decides to implement an [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec)-based security solution. On a network that is managed by a central IT department, computers will use the authentication infrastructure and policy distribution mechanism to implement [**domain**](#gt_domain) and server isolation. Step-by-step details about the configuration and resulting settings can be found in the references [[MSFT-ISOLATION-1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90188), [[MSFT-ISOLATION-2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90189), and [[MSFT-ISOLATION-3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90190).

To configure this functionality, the administrator needs to ensure that computers are members of the domain and are configured with the [**Group Policy**](#gt_group-policy) settings to require authentication for incoming communication attempts, to secure data traffic, and optionally, to encrypt data traffic. The security administrator configures this policy format in the IPsec policy administrative user interface.

<a id="Section_4.1"></a>
## 4.1 Administrative Creation/Assignment of Policy

To create and assign the policy, the security administrator uses an [**IPsec administrative plug-in**](#gt_ipsec-administrative-plug-in) user interface to configure and make active the required policy. This results in the Group Policy: IPsec Protocol transferring the settings to the IP Security container and the [**GPO**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) of the client computers that need to participate in the isolation mechanism. In this example, the [**domain**](#gt_domain) name myDomain.contoso.com is used.

<a id="Section_4.1.1"></a>
### 4.1.1 Policy Creation

## 4.2 Client Retrieval of Policy

On client machines that are members of the [**GPO**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo), the [**Group Policy**](#gt_group-policy) protocol client subsequently signals the [**IPsec client-side plug-in**](#gt_ipsec-client-side-plug-in), as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 3.2.5, "Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules", that an [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) policy has been activated. The policy is retrieved by using the Group Policy: IPsec Protocol and is supplied to the local IPsec/[**IKE**](#gt_internet-key-exchange-ike) component to enact the required policy.

# 5 Security

<a id="Section_5.1"></a>
## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

The transmission of the [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) configuration data can present a risk of disclosing the assets that the IPsec policy is being used to protect. Of particular concern is the transmission of a pre-shared key (in plain text), as specified in [ipsecNFA Object Attribute Details (section 2.2.1.3)](#Section_2.2.1.3), and whether the ability to determine the security controls allows an attacker to analyze the policy for weaknesses and organizational data. As such, implementers are advised to provide data integrity and data confidentiality for this protocol.

<a id="Section_5.2"></a>
## 5.2 Index of Security Parameters

This protocol does not explicitly control the security parameters that are used to protect the data; however, it does configure the [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec) component, which is a group of security parameter settings.
