# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Data Structures:

- The Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Data Structures allow data from one application to be stored in the document of another application. The first application is called the [**creating application**](#gt_creating-application) and the second application is called the [**container application**](#gt_container-application). The data itself is called an [**embedded object**](#gt_embedded-object).
- The OLE File Format Data Structures also allow a document from one application to reference data that resides in a different application. The first application is called the container application and the second application is called the creating application. The data being referenced is called a [**linked object**](#gt_linked-object).
For example, a user can embed a spreadsheet (which is data that belongs to the spreadsheet application) in a word-processing document. When the word-processing application displays the document to the user, it can establish that the spreadsheet data belongs to the spreadsheet application and the word-processing application can interact with the spreadsheet application to display the spreadsheet data to the user.

Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_american-national-standards-institute-ansi-character-set"></a>
**American National Standards Institute (ANSI) character set**: A character set defined by a code page approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The term "ANSI" as used to signify Windows code pages is a historical reference and a misnomer that persists in the Windows community. The source of this misnomer stems from the fact that the Windows code page 1252 was originally based on an ANSI draft, which became International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 8859-1 [[ISO/IEC-8859-1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90689). In Windows, the ANSI character set can be any of the following code pages: 1252, 1250, 1251, 1253, 1254, 1255, 1256, 1257, 1258, 874, 932, 936, 949, or 950. For example, "ANSI application" is usually a reference to a non-[**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) or code-page-based application. Therefore, "ANSI character set" is often misused to refer to one of the character sets defined by a Windows code page that can be used as an active system code page; for example, character sets defined by code page 1252 or character sets defined by code page 950. Windows is now based on [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode), so the use of ANSI character sets is strongly discouraged unless they are used to interoperate with legacy applications or legacy data.

<a id="gt_class-identifier-clsid"></a>
**class identifier (CLSID)**: A GUID that identifies a software component; for instance, a DCOM object class or a COM class.

<a id="gt_clipboard"></a>
**clipboard**: A program provided by the operating system that enables local data transfer between applications by using the cut, copy, and paste operations.

<a id="gt_color-matching"></a>
**color matching**: The conversion of a color, sent from its original color space, to its visually closest color in the destination color space. See also [**Image Color Management (ICM)**](#gt_image-color-management-icm).

<a id="gt_container-application"></a>
**container application**: An application that creates documents that store reference data from other applications.

<a id="gt_container-document"></a>
**container document**: A document that stores or references data from more than one application.

<a id="gt_creating-application"></a>
**creating application**: An application whose data is stored in or referenced by documents from other applications.

<a id="gt_dithering"></a>
**dithering**: A form of digital halftoning.

<a id="gt_drive-letter"></a>
**drive letter**: One of the 26 alphabetical characters A-Z, in uppercase or lowercase, that is assigned to a volume. Drive letters serve as a namespace through which data on the volume can be accessed. A volume with a drive letter can be referred to with the drive letter followed by a colon (for example, C:).

<a id="gt_embedded-object"></a>
**embedded object**: An object that is created by using one application and is hosted in a document that was created by using another application. Embedding an object, rather than inserting or pasting it, ensures that the object retains its original format. Users can double-click an embedded object and edit it with the toolbars and menus from the application that was used to create it. See also Object Linking and Embedding (OLE).

<a id="gt_image-color-management-icm"></a>
**Image Color Management (ICM)**: Technology that ensures that a color image, graphic, or text object is rendered as closely as possible to its original intent on any device despite differences in imaging technologies and color capabilities between devices.

<a id="gt_linked-object"></a>
**linked object**: An object that is inserted into a document and continues to exist in a separate source file. If the object in the source file changes, the object in the document is updated automatically to reflect those changes.

<a id="gt_little-endian"></a>
**little-endian**: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the least significant byte stored in the memory location with the lowest address.

<a id="gt_native-data"></a>
**native data**: The data that constitutes the state of an [**embedded object**](#gt_embedded-object). The only entity that can create and process the data is the [**creating application**](#gt_creating-application).

<a id="gt_n-up-printing"></a>
**n-up printing**: The act of arranging multiple logical pages on a physical sheet of paper.

<a id="gt_path"></a>
**path**: When referring to a file path on a file system, a hierarchical sequence of folders. When referring to a connection to a storage device, a connection through which a machine can communicate with the storage device.

<a id="gt_presentation-data"></a>
**presentation data**: Data that is required to display the linked or [**embedded object**](#gt_embedded-object) within the [**container application**](#gt_container-application).

<a id="gt_printer-driver"></a>
**printer driver**: The interface component between the operating system and the printer device. It is responsible for processing the application data into a page description language (PDL) that can be interpreted by the printer device.

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world. The [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) standard [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16 BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

<a id="gt_unicode-string"></a>
**Unicode string**: A [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) 8-bit string is an ordered sequence of 8-bit units, a [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) 16-bit string is an ordered sequence of 16-bit code units, and a [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) 32-bit string is an ordered sequence of 32-bit code units. In some cases, it could be acceptable not to terminate with a terminating null character. Unless otherwise specified, all [**Unicode strings**](#gt_unicode-string) follow the UTF-16LE encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).

<a id="gt_universal-naming-convention-unc"></a>
**Universal Naming Convention (UNC)**: A string format that specifies the location of a resource. For more information, see [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.2.57.

<a id="gt_value"></a>
**value**: A data element associated with a key.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.2"></a>

## 1.3 Overview

The Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Data Structures enable applications to create documents that contain linked or [**embedded objects**](#gt_embedded-object). The file format of an embedded object is different from that of a [**linked object**](#gt_linked-object) because the embedded object is required to contain its [**native data**](#gt_native-data) as well as data about its [**creating application**](#gt_creating-application). The linked object, however, is required only to contain a reference to its data. Both embedded and linked objects are required to contain [**presentation data**](#gt_presentation-data).

The following sections describe the logical layout of the file formats of embedded and linked objects.

<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 Embedded Objects

The logical layout of a [**container document**](#gt_container-document) that contains an [**embedded object**](#gt_embedded-object) is shown in the following figure.

![Embedded object container document](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Embedded object container document

The document contains data that is specific to the [**container application**](#gt_container-application), an identifier of the [**creating application**](#gt_creating-application), the [**native data**](#gt_native-data) of the embedded object, and the [**presentation data**](#gt_presentation-data) of the embedded object. The native data allows the container application to pass the object back to its creating application for possible changes.

The container application data is private to the container application and is not specified in this document. The rest of the data that make up the embedded object file format are specified in this document as follows:

Creating Application Identifier

- When using the OLE1.0 Format (section [1.3.3](#Section_1.3.3)), the creating application identifier is specified in the **ClassName** field of the [ObjectHeader](#Section_2.2.4) structure (section 2.2.4).
- When using the OLE2.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the creating application identifier is specified as follows:
- For embedded objects, the creating application identifier is specified by the object class globally unique identifier (GUID) contained in the [**class identifier (CLSID)**](#gt_class-identifier-clsid) field of the Compound File Directory Entry ([MS-CFB](../MS-CFB/MS-CFB.md) section 2.6.1) of the OLE Compound File Storage object ([MS-CFB] section 1.3) that contains the [OLESTREAM](#Section_2.3.3) structure (section 2.3.3) that specifies the embedded object.
- For linked objects, the creating application identifier is specified by the object class GUID contained in the **Clsid** field of the OLESTREAM structure (section 2.3.3) that specifies the linked object.
Embedded Object Native Data

- When using the OLE1.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the embedded object native data is specified in the **NativeData** field of [EmbeddedObject](#Section_2.2.5) structure (section 2.2.5).
- When using the OLE2.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the embedded object native data is specified in the following two ways, which can be used interchangeably:
- An OLE Compound File Stream object that uses the name "\1Ole10Native" is created within the OLE Compound File Storage object that corresponds to the [**linked object**](#gt_linked-object) or embedded object. The stream object is used to contain the native data, as specified in the **NativeData** field of the [OLENativeStream](#Section_2.3.6) structure (section 2.3.6).
- OLE Compound File Stream objects are created by the creating application within the OLE Compound File Storage object that corresponds to the linked object or embedded object. The stream objects are used to contain the native data. Such stream objects are private to the creating application and are not specified in this document.
Embedded Object Presentation Data

- When using the OLE1.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the embedded object presentation data is specified in the **Presentation** field of EmbeddedObject structure (section 2.2.5).
- When using the OLE2.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the embedded object presentation data is specified in OLE Compound File Stream objects with names that contain the prefix "\2OlePres" within the OLE Compound File Storage object. The names correspond to the linked object or embedded object. Each of these streams contains an instance of the [OLEPresentationStream](#Section_2.3.4) structure (section 2.3.4).
<a id="Section_1.3.2"></a>
### 1.3.2 Linked Objects

The logical layout of a [**container document**](#gt_container-document) that contains a [**linked object**](#gt_linked-object) is shown in the following figure:

![Linked object container document](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: Linked object container document

The document contains data that is specific to the [**container application**](#gt_container-application), data that describes the source file that contains the linked object's [**native data**](#gt_native-data), and the [**presentation data**](#gt_presentation-data) for the linked object. The document does not contain the native data of the linked object.

The container application data is private to the container application and is not specified in this document. The rest of the data that make up the linked object format are specified in this document as follows:

Linked File Source Data

- When using the OLE1.0 Format (section [1.3.3](#Section_1.3.3)), the Linked File Source Data is specified in the **TopicName** and the **NetworkName** fields of the [LinkedObject](#Section_2.2.6) structure (section 2.2.6).
- When using the OLE2.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the Linked File Source Data is specified by the **MonikerStream** field of the [OLEStream](#Section_2.3.3) structure (section 2.3.3).
Linked Object Presentation Data

- When using the OLE1.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the linked object presentation data is specified in the **Presentation** field of the LinkedObject structure (section 2.2.6).
- When using the OLE2.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the linked object presentation data is specified in the [OLEPresentationStream](#Section_2.3.4) structure (section 2.3.4).
<a id="Section_1.3.3"></a>
### 1.3.3 OLE1.0 and OLE2.0 Formats

There are two different formats for representing [linked objects](#Section_1.3.2) and [embedded objects](#Section_1.3.1) within [**container documents**](#gt_container-document). The first format is the OLE1.0 Format. This format predates the OLE Compound File technology (as specified in [MS-CFB](../MS-CFB/MS-CFB.md)). When using the OLE1.0 Format, the [**linked object**](#gt_linked-object) and [**embedded object**](#gt_embedded-object) data is laid out as a sequence of bytes within the container document. The data structures in section [2.2](../MS-CFB/MS-CFB.md) specify the format of the data within the byte sequence.

The second format is the OLE2.0 Format. This format uses the OLE Compound File technology (as specified in [MS-CFB]). When using the OLE2.0 Format, the [**container application**](#gt_container-application) creates an OLE Compound File Storage object ([MS-CFB] section 1.3) for each linked object or embedded object. The linked object or embedded object data is contained in this storage in the form of OLE Compound File Stream objects ([MS-CFB] section 1.3). The data structures in section [2.3](../MS-CFB/MS-CFB.md) specify the format of the data contained in the stream objects.

It is required that an application differentiate in advance whether it is processing a file that uses the OLE1.0 Format or the OLE2.0 Format. This information is local to the application and is not specified in this document.

It is strongly advised that implementations of this specification use the OLE2.0 Format when creating container documents. The OLE1.0 Format is specified to allow only for backward-compatible implementations.

<a id="Section_1.3.4"></a>
### 1.3.4 Miscellaneous OLE2.0 Streams

In addition to the OLE2.0 streams mentioned in sections [1.3.1](#Section_1.3.1) and [1.3.2](#Section_1.3.2), a [**container document**](#gt_container-document) can also include another OLE2.0 stream:

[CompObjStream](#Section_2.3.8) (section 2.3.7).

<a id="Section_1.3.5"></a>
### 1.3.5 Clipboard Formats

The users of [**container applications**](#gt_container-application) and [**creating applications**](#gt_creating-application) can use the system [**clipboard**](#gt_clipboard) to transfer data between applications. All data copied to a system clipboard has to conform to a format specification, known as a [Clipboard Format](#Section_1.3.5.1). Each Clipboard Format is identified by a unique numeric format ID.

<a id="Section_1.3.5.1"></a>
#### 1.3.5.1 Standard Clipboard Formats

This specification uses a number of [Clipboard Formats](#Section_1.3.5.1) called the Standard Clipboard Formats. These are specified in section 2.1.1. A standard Clipboard Format is identified by a numeric ID as specified in section 2.1.1.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Protocols and Other Structures

The OLE2.0 Format uses the OLE Compound File Streams (as specified in [MS-CFB](../MS-CFB/MS-CFB.md)) to store [**linked object**](#gt_linked-object) and embedded object data in [**container documents**](#gt_container-document).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Applicability Statement

The OLE File Format specification is appropriate when creating a single [**container document**](#gt_container-document) that contains data from multiple applications. It is applicable when one of the applications is the primary owner of the document and that application will always be asked to process the document first. It is not applicable if there are no applications with primary ownership of the document.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Versioning and Localization

There is only one version of the OLE File Format Data Structure. This data structure does not define locale-specific processes or data.

This document specifies two types of OLE File Formats: the OLE1.0 Format and the OLE2.0 Format. These two formats are independent and are not differentiated using a versioning mechanism.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Vendor-Extensible Fields

The Object Linking and Embedding Data Structures use HRESULT error codes. These [**values**](#gt_value) are taken from the Windows error number space as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md). Vendors SHOULD<1> reuse those values with their indicated meaning. Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the future.

<a id="Section_1.7.1"></a>
### 1.7.1 Registered Clipboard Formats

Vendors can create their own [Clipboard Formats](#Section_1.3.5.1), called Registered Clipboard Formats. A Registered Clipboard Format is identified by a string that contains the name of the Clipboard Format (as specified in section 2.1.1). Vendors can define their own Registered Clipboard Formats provided that the string that identifies the Registered Clipboard Format is prefixed with the "OleExternal" string literal.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Structures

Field types in packet diagrams are defined by the packet diagram and the field descriptions. All of the fields in packet diagrams use [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) byte ordering unless otherwise stated. There is no alignment padding between fields unless otherwise specified.

This protocol uses the following types specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md):

| Type | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| **HRESULT** | [MS-DTYP] section 2.2.18 |
| **LONG** | [MS-DTYP] section 2.2.27 |
| **FILETIME** | [MS-DTYP] section 2.3.3 |

Data structures in this document make use of [**ANSI**](#gt_american-national-standards-institute-ansi-character-set) characters. This structure specification does not mandate the use of any particular ANSI code page.<2>

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Common Data Types

This section describes the structures that are common to both the OLE1.0 Format and the OLE2.0 Format.

### 2.1.1 Clipboard Formats

[Standard Clipboard Formats](#Section_1.3.5.1) and [Registered Clipboard Formats](#Section_1.7.1) (see sections 1.3.5.1 and 1.7.1 for more details) are used to identify [**presentation data**](#gt_presentation-data) formats.

A standard clipboard format identifier is of type unsigned long.

A registered clipboard format is identified by a [LengthPrefixedAnsiString](#Section_2.1.4) (section [2.1.4](#Section_2.1.4)) or a LengthPrefixedUnicodeString (section [2.1.5](#Section_2.1.5)).

The Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Data Structures: Structure Specification defines the following standard clipboard format values to be used to identify presentation data formats:

| Name | Value | Presentation Data Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CF_BITMAP | 0x00000002 | Bitmap16 Object structure (as specified in [MS-WMF](../MS-WMF/MS-WMF.md) section 2.2.2.1) |
| CF_METAFILEPICT | 0x00000003 | Windows metafile (as specified in [MS-WMF] section 1.3.1) |
| CF_DIB | 0x00000008 | DeviceIndependentBitmap Object structure (as specified in [MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.9) |
| CF_ENHMETAFILE | 0x0000000E | Enhanced Metafile (as specified in [MS-EMF](../MS-EMF/MS-EMF.md) section 1.3.1) |

In addition, an application or higher level protocol MAY supply registered clipboard formats (section 1.7.1) to identify custom presentation data formats.

**TargetDevice (variable):** This field MUST contain a [DVTARGETDEVICE](#Section_2.1.7) structure (as specified in section 2.1.7).

<a id="Section_2.3.6"></a>
### 2.3.6 OLENativeStream

The OLENativeStream structure is contained inside an **OLE Compound File Stream** object ([MS-CFB](../MS-CFB/MS-CFB.md) section 1.3). The **OLE Compound File Stream** object is named "\1Ole10Native". The stream object is contained within the OLE Compound File Storage object ([MS-CFB] section 1.3) that corresponds to the linked object or embedded object (see section [1.3.3](../MS-CFB/MS-CFB.md)). This stream is present when [**native data**](#gt_native-data) from a [**container document**](#gt_container-document) in the OLE1.0 format is converted to the OLE2.0 format. The [OLENativeStream](#Section_2.3.5) structure specifies the native data for OLE1.0 [**embedded objects**](#gt_embedded-object).

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-31: "NativeDataSize"
  32-95: "NativeData (variable)"
```

**NativeDataSize (4 bytes):** This MUST be set to the size, in bytes, of the **NativeData** field.

**NativeData (variable):** This MUST be set to an array of bytes that contains the native data.

<a id="Section_2.3.7"></a>
### 2.3.7 CompObjHeader

The CompObjHeader structure specifies the header of the CompObjStream structure (section [2.3.8](#Section_2.3.8)).

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-31: "Reserved1"
  32-63: "Version"
  64-159: "Reserved2 (20 bytes)"
```

**Reserved1 (4 bytes):** This can be set to any arbitrary value and MUST be ignored on processing.

**Version (4 bytes):** This can be set to any arbitrary value and MUST be ignored on processing.

**Reserved2 (20 bytes):** This can be set to any arbitrary value and MUST be ignored on processing.

<a id="Section_2.3.8"></a>
### 2.3.8 CompObjStream

The CompObjStream structure is contained inside of an **OLE Compound File Stream** (as specified in [MS-CFB](../MS-CFB/MS-CFB.md)). The **OLE Compound File Stream** has the name "\1CompObj". The CompObjStream structure specifies the [Clipboard Format](#Section_1.3.5.1) and the display name of the linked object or embedded object.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-95: "Header (28 bytes)"
  96-159: "AnsiUserType (variable)"
  160-223: "AnsiClipboardFormat (variable)"
  224-287: "Reserved1 (variable)"
  288-351: "UnicodeMarker (variable)"
  352-415: "UnicodeUserType (variable)"
  416-479: "UnicodeClipboardFormat (variable)"
  480-543: "Reserved2 (variable)"
```

**Header (28 bytes):** This MUST be a [CompObjHeader](#Section_2.3.8) structure (section 2.3.7).

**AnsiUserType (variable):** This MUST be a [LengthPrefixedAnsiString](#Section_2.1.4) structure (section [2.1.4](#Section_2.1.4)) that contains a display name of the linked object or embedded object.

**AnsiClipboardFormat (variable):** This MUST be a [ClipboardFormatOrAnsiString](#Section_2.3.1) structure (section 2.3.1) that contains the Clipboard Format of the linked object or embedded object. If the **MarkerOrLength** field of the ClipboardFormatOrAnsiString structure contains a value other than 0x00000000, 0xffffffff, or 0xfffffffe, the value MUST NOT be greater than 0x00000190. Otherwise the CompObjStream structure is invalid.<24>

**Reserved1 (variable):** If present, this MUST be a LengthPrefixedAnsiString structure (section 2.1.4). If the **Length** field of the LengthPrefixedAnsiString contains a value of 0 or a value that is greater than 0x00000028 , the remaining fields of the structure starting with the **String** field of the LengthPrefixedAnsiString MUST be ignored on processing.

If the **String** field of the LengthPrefixedAnsiString is not present, the remaining fields of the structure starting with the **UnicodeMarker** field MUST be ignored on processing.

Otherwise, the **String** field of the LengthPrefixedAnsiString MUST be ignored on processing.

**UnicodeMarker (variable):** If this field is present and is NOT set to 0x71B239F4, the remaining fields of the structure MUST be ignored on processing.

**UnicodeUserType (variable):** This MUST be a [LengthPrefixedUnicodeString](#Section_2.1.5) structure (section 2.1.5) that contains a display name of the linked object or embedded object.

**UnicodeClipboardFormat (variable):** This MUST be a [ClipboardFormatOrUnicodeString](#Section_2.3.2) structure (section 2.3.2) that contains a Clipboard Format of the linked object or embedded object. If the **MarkerOrLength** field of the ClipboardFormatOrUnicodeString structure contains a value other than 0x00000000, 0xffffffff, or 0xfffffffe, the value MUST NOT be more than 0x00000190. Otherwise, the CompObjStream structure is invalid. <25>

**Reserved2 (variable):** This MUST be a LengthPrefixedUnicodeString (section 2.1.5). The **String** field of the LengthPrefixedUnicodeString can contain any arbitrary value and MUST be ignored on processing.
