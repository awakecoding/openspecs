# 1 Introduction

This is a specification of the Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol. This protocol defines [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interfaces that provide methods for remotely accessing and administering a server for the [**Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins). This protocol is a client/server protocol that is based on RPC and is used in the configuration, management, and monitoring of a [**WINS server**](#gt_wins-server).

An application implementing this protocol can remotely perform service monitoring of a WINS server as well as creating, updating, querying, or deleting database records, performing database [**scavenging**](#gt_scavenging), and [**replicating**](#gt_replication) the database records with other WINS servers.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_active"></a>
**active**: A state of an attributeSchema or classSchema object that represents part of the schema. It is possible to instantiate an [**active**](#gt_active) attribute or an [**active**](#gt_active) class. The opposite term is defunct.

<a id="gt_active-record"></a>
**active record**: A [**name record**](#gt_name-record) that has been registered but not released.

<a id="gt_address-version-map"></a>
**address version map**: See [**owner version map**](#gt_owner-version-map).

**client**: A computer on which the remote procedure call (RPC) client is executing.

<a id="gt_dynamic-record"></a>
**dynamic record**: A [**name record**](#gt_name-record) that is created through NetBT name registration by a [**client**](#gt_client).

<a id="gt_endpoint"></a>
**endpoint**: A network-specific address of a remote procedure call (RPC) server process for remote procedure calls. The actual name and type of the endpoint depends on the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol sequence that is being used. For example, for RPC over TCP (RPC Protocol Sequence ncacn_ip_tcp), an endpoint might be TCP port 1025. For RPC over Server Message Block (RPC Protocol Sequence ncacn_np), an endpoint might be the name of a [**named pipe**](#gt_named-pipe). For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_extinction-interval"></a>

**NetBIOS**: A particular network transport that is part of the LAN Manager protocol suite. [**NetBIOS**](#gt_netbios) uses a broadcast communication style that was applicable to early segmented local area networks. A protocol family including name resolution, datagram, and connection services. For more information, see [[RFC1001]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90260) and [[RFC1002]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90261).

<a id="gt_netbios-name"></a>

<a id="gt_netbios-name-server-nbns"></a>
**NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS)**: A server that stores NetBIOS name-to-IPv4 address mappings and that resolves NetBIOS names for NBT-enabled hosts. A server running the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) is the Microsoft implementation of an NBNS.

<a id="gt_netbios-scope"></a>
**NetBIOS scope**: The population of computers across which a registered [**NetBIOS name**](#gt_netbios-name) is known. Each NetBIOS scope has a scope identifier, which is a character string that meets the requirements of the Domain Name System (DNS) for domain names.

<a id="gt_netbios-suffix"></a>
**NetBIOS suffix**: The 16th byte of a 16-byte [**NetBIOS name**](#gt_netbios-name) that is constructed using the optional naming convention defined in [MS-NBTE](../MS-NBTE/MS-NBTE.md) section 1.8.

**NetBT h-node**: A combination of [**NetBT b-node**](#gt_netbt-b-node) and [**p-node**](#gt_p-node) functionality. An h-node uses point-to-point communication first. If the [**NBNS**](#gt_netbios-name-server-nbns) cannot be located, h-node switches to broadcast. The h-node continues to poll for the name server and returns to point-to-point communication when one becomes available.

<a id="gt_netbt-m-node"></a>
**NetBT m-node**: A [**NetBT node type**](#gt_netbt-node-type) that uses a mix of b-node and [**p-node**](#gt_p-node) communications to register and resolve [**NetBIOS names**](#gt_netbios-name). An m-node uses broadcast resolution first; then, if necessary, it uses a server query.

<a id="gt_netbt-node-type"></a>
**NetBT node type**: The transport mechanism used to resolve [**NetBIOS names**](#gt_netbios-name) that are broadcast, multicast, or unicast.

<a id="gt_normal-group"></a>
**normal group**: A group of hosts that does not have an associated address. It is assumed to be valid on any subnet.

<a id="gt_owner"></a>
**owner**: A security principal who has the requisite permission to manage a security group.

<a id="gt_owner-nbns-server"></a>
**owner NBNS server**: An [**NBNS server**](#gt_netbios-name-server-nbns) that handles the name registration of a [**client**](#gt_client) and so owns the mapping for that [**client**](#gt_client). An owner NBNS server is also referred to by the term [**owner WINS server**](#gt_owner-wins-server).

<a id="gt_owner-version-map"></a>
**owner version map**: A table in which each entry has two fields, owner and version number. The owner field contains a [**WINS server**](#gt_wins-server) address; the version number field contains the highest version number of all the records owned by the [**owner WINS server**](#gt_owner-wins-server) that are stored at the local [**WINS server**](#gt_wins-server).

<a id="gt_owner-wins-server"></a>
**owner WINS server**: See [**owner NBNS server**](#gt_owner-nbns-server).

<a id="gt_partner"></a>
**partner**: A computer connected to a local computer through either inbound or outbound connections.

<a id="gt_p-node"></a>
**p-node**: When using p-node NetBIOS name resolution, broadcasts are not used for name registration or NetBIOS name resolution. Instead, all systems register themselves with a NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS) upon startup. The NBNS is responsible for mapping computer names to IPv4 addresses and making sure that no duplicate names are registered on the network.

<a id="gt_priority-class"></a>
**priority class**: An attribute of a process that is used to determine the scheduling priority of threads of that process. The priority of a thread is determined by a combination of the priority class of its process and the priority level of the thread within the priority class.

<a id="gt_released"></a>
**RELEASED**: The state of a [**name record**](#gt_name-record), in which its name has been explicitly released through a name release request, or in which it has failed to be refreshed by name by a [**client**](#gt_client) within the renewal interval.

<a id="gt_released-record"></a>
**released record**: A [**name record**](#gt_name-record) that has been explicitly released through a name release request; or a [**name record**](#gt_name-record) that a [**client**](#gt_client) has failed to refresh by name within the renewal interval.

<a id="gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc"></a>
**remote procedure call (RPC)**: A communication protocol used primarily between client and server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message). For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_replication"></a>
**replication**: The process of propagating the effects of all originating writes to any replica of a naming context (NC), to all replicas of the NC. If originating writes cease and replication continues, all replicas converge to a common application-visible state.

<a id="gt_replication-partner"></a>
**replication partner**: See NBNS replication partner

<a id="gt_scavenging"></a>
**scavenging**: A regularly scheduled process in which the state of database records are changed if they have not been updated within a certain time interval, measured by the process that checks whether current time exceeds the record's time stamp value.

<a id="gt_security-support-provider-ssp"></a>
**security support provider (SSP)**: A dynamic-link library (DLL) that implements the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) by making one or more security packages available to applications. Each security package provides mappings between an application's SSPI function calls and an actual security model's functions. Security packages support security protocols such as Kerberos authentication and NTLM.

<a id="gt_special-group"></a>
**special group**: A group of hosts that have a single name. When a name registration is received for a special group, the actual address rather than the limited broadcast address is stored in the group. When a name query is received for such a group, the [**IPv4**](#gt_internet-protocol-version-4-ipv4) addresses that have not timed out are returned.

<a id="gt_static-record"></a>
**static record**: A manually created entry in the database of a [**NBNS server**](#gt_netbios-name-server-nbns).

<a id="gt_target-wins-server"></a>
**target WINS server**: The [**WINS server**](#gt_wins-server) on which the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) method call is being executed.

<a id="gt_tombstone"></a>
**tombstone**: An individual record of scheduling data that represents a Meeting object where an attendee declined a meeting.

<a id="gt_tombstone-interval"></a>
**tombstone interval**: See [**extinction interval**](#gt_extinction-interval).

<a id="gt_tombstone-state-tombstoned"></a>
**tombstone state, tombstoned**: The state of a [**released record**](#gt_released-record) that is not re-registered or refreshed by a [**client**](#gt_client) within the [**extinction interval**](#gt_extinction-interval).

<a id="gt_transmission-control-protocol-tcp"></a>
**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: A protocol used with the Internet Protocol (IP) to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. TCP handles keeping track of the individual units of data (called packets) that a message is divided into for efficient routing through the Internet.

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world. The [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) standard [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16 BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

<a id="gt_unicode-string"></a>
**Unicode string**: A [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) 8-bit string is an ordered sequence of 8-bit units, a [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) 16-bit string is an ordered sequence of 16-bit code units, and a [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) 32-bit string is an ordered sequence of 32-bit code units. In some cases, it could be acceptable not to terminate with a terminating null character. Unless otherwise specified, all [**Unicode strings**](#gt_unicode-string) follow the [**UTF-16LE**](#gt_utf-16le) encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [C706] must be used for generating the UUID.

<a id="gt_utf-16le"></a>
**UTF-16LE**: The Unicode Transformation Format - 16-bit, Little Endian encoding scheme. It is used to encode [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) characters as a sequence of 16-bit codes, each encoded as two 8-bit bytes with the least-significant byte first.

<a id="gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins"></a>
**Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)**: A name service for the NetBIOS protocol, particularly designed to ease transition to a TCP/IP based network. An implementation of an [**NBNS server**](#gt_netbios-name-server-nbns).

<a id="gt_wins-server"></a>
**WINS server**: A server that hosts a Microsoft implementation of an [**NBNS server**](#gt_netbios-name-server-nbns).

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol is a client/server protocol that is used to remotely configure, manage, and monitor the [**WINS server**](#gt_wins-server). This protocol allows a [**client**](#gt_client) to view and update the server configuration settings as well as to create, modify, and delete [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) database records. It also allows clients to trigger [**scavenging**](#gt_scavenging) and replicating operations and to query the database.

The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol is stateless with no state shared across [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) method calls. Each RPC method call contains one complete request. Output from one method call can be used as an input to another call, but the protocol does not provide methods for locking the WINS server con figuration or state data across method calls. For example, a client can pull a range of records from the database and delete some of them using another RPC call. However, the protocol does not guarantee that the specified record has not been modified by another client between the two method calls.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol relies on [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) as a transport. It is used to manage the [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) service on servers that implement the Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) Replication and Autodiscovery Protocol [MS-WINSRA](../MS-WINSRA/MS-WINSRA.md).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol is implemented on top of [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) and, as a result, has the prerequisites identified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol assumes that before this protocol is invoked, a client has obtained the name or the IP address of the [**WINS server**](#gt_wins-server) that implements this protocol suite.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol is applicable when an application needs to remotely configure, manage, or monitor a [**WINS server**](#gt_wins-server).

Because the [**NetBIOS**](#gt_netbios) protocol [[RFC1002]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90261) does not support the mapping between [**NetBIOS names**](#gt_netbios-name) and [**IPv6**](#gt_internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6) addresses, the Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol applies only to [**IPv4**](#gt_internet-protocol-version-4-ipv4) addresses. It does not apply to IPv6 addresses.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

- **Supported Transports**: The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol uses the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol as a transport and [RPC Protocol Sequences](#Section_2.1) as specified in section 2.1.
- **Protocol Versions**: This protocol has only one interface version, but that interface has been extended by adding additional methods at the end. The use of these methods is specified in section [3.1](#Section_1.3).
- **Security and Authentication Methods**: Authentication and security for the methods specified by this protocol are specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) and in section 2.1.
- **Localization**: This protocol passes text strings in various methods. Localization considerations for such strings are specified in sections [2.2](#Section_2.2) and [3.1.4](#Section_3.1.4).
- **Capability Negotiation**: The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol does not support interface version negotiation. Instead, this protocol uses the interface version number specified in the [**interface definition language (IDL)**](#gt_interface-definition-language-idl) for versioning and capability negotiation.
<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol uses Win32 error codes as defined in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) (section 2.2). Vendors SHOULD reuse those values with their indicated meanings. Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the future.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol uses the following private assignments.

| Parameter | Value | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |

## 2.1 Transport

For the Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol, the [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins)server MUST support the following [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) transports:

- RPC over [**TCP**](#gt_transmission-control-protocol-tcp), with port selection performed dynamically by RPC.
- RPC over [**named pipes**](#gt_named-pipe), with the [**endpoint**](#gt_endpoint) name "\pipe\WinsPipe".
<a id="Section_2.1.1"></a>
### 2.1.1 Server Security Settings

The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol uses [**security support provider (SSP)**](#gt_security-support-provider-ssp) security provided by [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md). The [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) RPC server uses the principal name "Wins" and the authentication service RPC_C_AUTHN_WINNT.

The WINS server MUST allow only authenticated access to RPC clients. The WINS server MUST NOT allow anonymous or unauthenticated RPC clients to connect. The WINS server MUST perform authorization checks to ensure that the client is authorized to perform a specific RPC operation.

The following mechanisms are enforced for client authorization:

- The WINSRA client SHOULD be a member of the WINS Users or WINS Administrator security group in order to retrieve information from the WINS server. This level of authorization is termed "query-level access".<1>
- The WINSRA client MUST be a member of the WINS Administrator security group before it can retrieve or modify information on the WINS server. This level of authorization is termed "control-level access".
Control-level access also includes query-level access. Therefore, clients with control access can also call methods that require only query-level access. The WINS server MUST limit access to only those clients that negotiate an [**authentication level**](#gt_authentication-level) equal to or higher than RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_CONNECT.

<a id="Section_2.1.2"></a>
### 2.1.2 Client Security Settings

The [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) client SHOULD use [**security support provider (SSP)**](#gt_security-support-provider-ssp) security provided by RPC as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md). The clients SHOULD use the server principal name "Wins", authentication service RPC_C_AUTHN_WINNT, and [**authentication level**](#gt_authentication-level) RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_CONNECT while creating the binding handle.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Common Data Types

In addition to the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) base types and definitions specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md), additional data types are defined in this section. The following statements apply to those data types unless indicated otherwise:

- All multiple byte numeric values in messages use [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) byte order.
- All character strings are encoded in [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) [**UTF-16LE**](#gt_utf-16le).

# 3 Protocol Details

The client side of The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol is simply a pass-through. This means that no additional timers or state are required on the client side of this protocol. Calls made by the higher-layer protocol or application are passed directly to the transport, and the results returned by the transport are passed directly back to the higher-layer protocol or application.

The [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server supports two interfaces:

- [winsif (section 3.1.4)](#Section_3.1.4)
- [winsi2 (section 3.2.4)](#Section_3.1.4)
To support both interfaces, client applications are responsible for implementing mechanisms to manage memory such as the following:

- **midl_user_allocate**: Allocates memory for [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) input and output parameters.
- **midl_user_free**: Frees memory used by RPC input and output parameters.
Clients SHOULD call **midl_user_allocate** to allocate memory for any input pointer arguments to the RPC methods. The client RPC stub MUST send the input data to the server and then SHOULD free that memory by calling **midl_user_free**. Similarly, when the client RPC stub receives a response from server, it SHOULD call **midl_user_allocate** to allocate memory for all output pointer arguments. Client applications SHOULD free this memory by calling **midl_user_free**.

## 3.1 winsif Server Details

The methods supported by the **winsif** interface are specified in [Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules (section 3.1.4)](#Section_3.1.4).

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model that an implementation can maintain to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of protocol behavior. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

A [**NetBIOS name server (NBNS)**](#gt_netbios-name-server-nbns) maintains the following data structures:

**Name record**: A data structure that contains a name and the associated attributes.

**Name records collection**: A collection of all [**name records**](#gt_name-record) that are either registered by this NBNS server or obtained by [**replication**](#gt_replication).

**Owner version map**: A map between each NBNS [**owner**](#gt_owner) and the record from that owner with the highest version number in the name records collection. This map determines whether the NBNS server pulls records from its partners and, if so, the range of records it obtains.

**Global version counter**: A 64-bit unsigned integer that tracks the version number given to the next record that is updated.

**Server configuration**: Parameters maintained in persistent storage include the following:

- Refresh interval
- [**Extinction interval**](#gt_extinction-interval)
- Extinction timeout
- Verify interval
- Process [**priority class**](#gt_priority-class)
- Number of worker threads
**Browser name cache**: A list of browser names that are stored in the [**target WINS server**](#gt_target-wins-server). When the [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) service is initialized, the cache SHOULD be empty.

The **Browser name cache** SHOULD be populated when the **R_WinsGetBrowserNames** method (section [3.1.4.18](#Section_3.1.4.15)) is called for the first time, and every subsequent call to that method SHOULD return the contents of the cache. If 3 minutes or more has elapsed from the time the **Browser name cache** is refreshed, the WINS service SHOULD get the name records from the target WINS server database and update the cache.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

No timers are required beyond those used internally by [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) to implement resiliency to network outages, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.2.3.2.1.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The **winsif** server for the Remote Administrative Interface: WINS MUST be initialized by registering the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interface and listening on the dynamically allocated port assigned by RPC, as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1). The client MUST contact the well-known RPC port on the [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server to find the [**endpoint**](#gt_endpoint) of **winsif**.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

Otherwise, the **TimeStamp** member SHOULD contain one of the following Win32 error codes, as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md):

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 ERROR_SUCCESS | The call was successful. |
| 0x00000FA0 ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL | An error occurred while processing the RPC call. |
| 0x00000FA5 ERROR_REC_NON_EXISTENT | The name does not exist in the database. This error is returned only if a requested WINSINTF_E_QUERY operation is not successful. |
| 0x00000005 ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED | The caller doesn't have sufficient permissions. |

**Exceptions Thrown**: No exceptions are thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

**Processing and Response Requirements**:

The **Opnum** value for this method is 0.

When processing this call, the WINS server MUST do the following:

- If the action specified is WINSINTF_E_QUERY, the RPC method caller SHOULD have query level access.<4> For all other actions the caller SHOULD have control level access. If an RPC client with a lower access level calls this method, the server SHOULD return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
- The WINS service on the target WINS server MUST be in the running or paused state for this method to complete successfully. If the service is in initializing or exiting state, ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL status SHOULD be returned.
- When the RPC method is called with an action set to WINSINTF_E_INSERT, the requested record is inserted into the database. If the record with the same name already exists in the database, name resolution occurs as described in [MS-WINSRA](../MS-WINSRA/MS-WINSRA.md). The server returns ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL, if any error occurs while performing the resolution or inserting the record.<5>
- When an RPC method is called with the action set to WINSINTF_E_RELEASE, the state of the matching record is changed to RELEASED in the database. If a matching record is not found, the server returns ERROR_SUCCESS. If any failure occurs during the modification of the record state, ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL is returned.
- When an RPC method is called with the action set to WINSINTF_E_MODIFY, the database is searched for a matching record. If a match is found, the attributes of the record such as record type, node type, record state, and *fstatic* are modified according to the requested values. If the matching record's type is either unique or [**Normal Group**](#gt_normal-group) and a request comes to modify it to multihomed or [**Special Group**](#gt_special-group), respectively, an ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL error is returned; otherwise, ERROR_SUCCESS is returned. If the record is not found in the database, the server returns ERROR_SUCCESS.
- When the RPC method is called with the action set to WINSINTF_E_QUERY, the database is queried for the given name. If a matching record is found, the attributes of the record are returned to the RPC caller. If the record is not found or if any error occurs during attribute retrieval, the server returns an ERROR_REC_NON_EXISTENT error.
- When the RPC method is called with the action set to WINSINTF_E_DELETE, the matching record is deleted from the database. If a matching record is not found in the database, an ERROR_SUCCESS status code is returned. If any error occurs during the database operations, an ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL is returned. The RPC method caller MUST set *state_e* to DELETED for this action to succeed.

#### 3.1.4.2 R_WinsStatus (Opnum 1)

The R_WinsStatus method retrieves configuration settings and statistics from a [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server.

DWORD R_WinsStatus(

[in] handle_t ServerHdl,

[in] WINSINTF_CMD_E Cmd_e,

[in, out, ref] PWINSINTF_RESULTS_T pResults

);

**ServerHdl:** An [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding over IP address/HostName to the WINS server. RPC uses this binding internally to determine which WINS server the call is directed to.

**Cmd_e:** The command to be executed on the [**target WINS server**](#gt_target-wins-server) from the [WINSINTF_CMD_E](#Section_2.2.1.5) enumeration (section 2.2.1.5).

**pResults:** A pointer to a [WINSINTF_RESULTS_T](#Section_2.2.2.7) structure (section 2.2.2.7) that contains configuration data and statistics for the target WINS server.

**Return Values:** A 32-bit unsigned integer value that indicates return status. A return value of ERROR_SUCCESS (0x00000000) indicates that the operation completed successfully. Otherwise, this return value is a Win32 error code, as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md). The following Win32 error codes can be returned.

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 ERROR_SUCCESS | The call was successful. |
| 0x00000FA0 ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL | An error occurred while processing the RPC call. |
| 0x00000005 ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED | The caller doesn't have sufficient permissions. |

**Exceptions Thrown**: No exceptions are thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

**Processing and Response Requirements**:

The following requirements and recommendations apply to the WINS server that processes a call to R_WinStatus:

- The R_WinStatus caller SHOULD have query level access.<6> If an RPC client with a lower access level calls R_WinStatus, the server SHOULD return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
- The WINS service on the target WINS server MUST be in the running or paused state. If the service is in initializing or exiting state, the server SHOULD return ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL.
- When R_WinStatus is called with the **Cmd_e** parameter set to WINSINTF_E_ADDVERSMAP, the first entry of the *AddVersMaps* array SHOULD contain the address of the [**WINS server**](#gt_wins-server) for which the version number is requested. The WINSINTF_E_ADDVERSMAP command retrieves the version number for the specified [**owner**](#gt_owner) address from the [**owner version map**](#gt_owner-version-map) of the target WINS server. The retrieved version number is stored in the *AddVersMaps[0].VersNo* parameter. If the address of the [**owner WINS server**](#gt_owner-wins-server) is not found in the owner-version map of the target WINS server, an ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL error is returned.
- When R_WinStatus is called with the *Cmd_e* parameter set to WINSINTF_E_CONFIG, the *pResults* parameter is used only for output. The *NoOfOwners* and *AddVersMaps* parameters specify the owner version map table maintained on the target WINS server. If the owner version map table has more than 25 entries, only the first 25 entries are copied to *pResults->AddVersMaps*. The *RefreshInterval*, *TombstoneInterval*, *TombstoneTimeout*, *VerifyInterval*, *WINSPriorityClass*, and *NoOfWorkerThds* members get values according to the configuration of the target WINS server. The *WINSStat* parameter is not used for this command. An ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL error is returned if any error occurs during processing of a WINSINTF_E_CONFIG command.
- When R_WinStatus is called with the **Cmd_e** parameter set to WINSINTF_E_CONFIG_ALL_MAPS, the behavior is the same as specified for the WINSINTF_E_CONFIG command except that the owner version map entry is returned even if it is marked as deleted.
- When R_WinStatus is called with the **Cmd_e** parameter set to WINSINTF_E_STAT, the *pResults* parameter is used only for output. Statistics for the target WINS server are copied to *pResults->WINSStat*. The *pResults->WINSStat.pRplPnrs* pointer MUST be NULL for this operation to succeed. The WINSINTF_E_STAT command also retrieves the information retrieved by the WINSINTF_E_CONFIG command. An ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL error is returned if any error occurs during processing of a WINSINTF_E_STAT command.
<a id="Section_3.1.4.3"></a>
#### 3.1.4.3 R_WinsTrigger (Opnum 2)

The R_WinsTrigger method triggers a replication operation between a [**target WINS server**](#gt_target-wins-server) and another [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server.

DWORD R_WinsTrigger(

[in] handle_t ServerHdl,

[in, ref] PWINSINTF_ADD_T pWinsAdd,

[in] WINSINTF_TRIG_TYPE_E TrigType_e

);

**ServerHdl:** An [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding over IP address/HostName to the WINS server. RPC uses this binding internally to determine which WINS server the call is directed to.

**pWinsAdd:** Address of the WINS server with which the target WINS server performs the replication operation.

**TrigType_e:** The type of replication operation requested.

**Return Values:** A 32 bit unsigned integer value that indicates the return status. A return value of ERROR_SUCCESS (0x00000000) indicates that the operation completed successfully. Any other return value is a Win32 error code, as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md). The following Win32 error codes can be returned:

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 ERROR_SUCCESS | The call was successful. |
| 0x00000FA0 ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL | An error occurred while processing the RPC call. |
| 0x00000FA6 ERROR_RPL_NOT_ALLOWED | The WINS server requested for the replication operation is requested is not configured as a replication partner for the target WINS server. |
| 0x00000005 ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED | The caller does not have sufficient permissions. |

**Exceptions Thrown**: No exceptions are thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

**Processing and Response Requirements**:

When R_WinsTrigger is called, the server returns immediately without waiting for the replication operation to finish. The server just queues a request for the replication operation, and the replication takes place at a time determined by the internal state and configuration of the target WINS server. Hence, applications that call R_WinsTrigger SHOULD NOT treat an ERROR_SUCCESS return value as indicating a successful replication operation. Instead, applications SHOULD rely on WINS event logs to determine whether or not replication is successful. The following table lists the events that indicate the status of replication.

| Event ID | Event Name | Event Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Informational events | - | - |
| 4102 | WINS_EVT_CONN_ABORTED | The connection was aborted by the remote WINS. It is possible that Remote WINS is not configured to replicate with the server. |
| 4108 | WINS_EVT_CANT_GET_INITRPL_VAL | WINS could not read the InitTimeReplication field of the pull/push key. |
| 4115 | WINS_EVT_CANT_GET_CC_MAX_RECS_AAT_VAL | WINS could not read the MaxRecsAtATime value (type DWORD) in the Wins\Parameters\ConsistencyCheck subkey of the registry. Set this value so that WINS does not replicate more than a set number of records in one cycle while doing periodic consistency checks of the WINS database. When doing a consistency check, WINS replicates all records of an owner WINS by either going to that WINS or to a replication partner. At the end of a consistency check for an owner's records, WINS checks to see if it has replicated more than the specified values in the current consistency check cycle. If the value has been exceeded, the consistency check stops; otherwise it continues. In the next cycle, it starts from where it left off and returns to the first owner if required. |
| 4116 | WINS_EVT_CANT_GET_CC_USE_RPL_PNRS_VAL | WINS could not read the UseRplPnrs value of the Wins\Parameters\ConsistencyCheck key. If this value is set to a nonzero (DWORD) value, WINS will do a consistency check of the owners in its database by going to one or more of its replication partners. If the owner of the records happens to be a replication partner, WINS will go to it; otherwise it will pick a partner at random. Set this value if there is a large number of WINSs in the configuration and/or if the local WINS SHOULD NOT to go to any WINS that is not a replication partner. |
| 4121 | WINS_EVT_NO_RPL_RECS_RETRIEVED | The WINS Replicator could not find any records in the WINS database. This means there are no active or tombstone records in the database. It could be that the records being requested by a remote WINS server have either been released or do not exist. |
| 4124 | WINS_EVT_UPD_NTF_NOT_ACCEPTED | The WINS server received an update notification from the non-configured WINS server at the address, %1. The WINS server rejected it. This means the remote WINS server is not in the list of Push partners (WINS servers under the Pull key) and the administrator has prohibited (by using the registry) replication with non-configured WINS servers. To have this WINS server to accept update notifications from non-configured WINS servers then set the Wins\Parameters\RplOnlyWCnfPnrs value in the registry to 0. |
| 4126 | WINS_EVT_ADD_VERS_MAP_REQ_NOT_ACCEPTED | The WINS server received a pull request from the non-configured WINS server with the address, %1. The WINS server rejected it since the remote WINS server is not in the list of Pull partners (WINS servers under the Pull key) and the administrator has prohibited (by using the registry) replication with non-configured partners. To have this WINS server to accept update notifications from WINS servers not in the "pull partner" list, then set the "replication only with configured partners" value in the registry to 0. |
| 4134 | WINS_EVT_INF_REM_WINS | The local WINS is informing a remote WINS to update the version number of a record. This is because the local WINS encountered a conflict between an active owned name and an active replica that it pulled from a replication partner. |
| 4135 | WINS_EVT_REM_WINS_INF | The local WINS has been informed by a remote WINS with the address %1, to update the version number of a record. This is because the remote WINS encountered a conflict between an active owned name and an active replica that it pulled from a replication partner. |
| 4137 | WINS_EVT_NAME_MISMATCH | A name mismatch was reported while verifying the validity of old replicas. The local record has the name %1 while the replica pulled in from the WINS that owns this record has the name %2. This could mean that the remote WINS was stopped and then restarted but its version counter value was not set to its previous value before termination. |
| 4139 | WINS_EVT_CNF_CHANGE | The WINS replication request is being ignored because WINS found that the Wins\Partners key information has changed (due to a notification from the registry) which makes the current partner request out-of-date. |
| 4227 | WINS_EVT_CANT_FIND_ANY_REC_IN_RANGE | The Push Thread was requested for a range of records but could not find any records in the range. The replication time intervals MUST be set properly. If the tombstone interval and timeout intervals are not correct (that is, much less than the replication interval), the preceding condition is possible. This is because the records might get changed into tombstones and then deleted before the remote WINS can pull them. Similarly, if the refresh interval is set to be much less than the replication interval, then the records could get released before a WINS can pull them (a released record is not sent). |
| 4251 | WINS_EVT_CONN_RETRIES_FAILED | The WINS Replication Pull Handler could not connect to a WINS server. All retries failed. WINS will try again after a set number of replication time intervals have elapsed. |
| 4260 | WINS_EVT_RPL_REG_ERR | WINS received an error while registering replicas. It will not register any additional replicas of this WINS at this time (the address is in the data section fourth through eighth byte). A previous log entry will specify the reason for this. If the same error occurs during subsequent replication with the preceding partner WINS, restore the WINS database from the backup. |
| 4261 | WINS_EVT_RPL_REG_GRP_MEM_ERR | WINS received an error while trying to register a group's replica with name %1. The replica is owned by the WINS with the address given in the data section. |
| 4262 | WINS_EVT_RPL_REG_UNIQUE_ERR | WINS received an error while trying to register a unique replica with name %1. The replica is owned by WINS with the address in the data section. |
| 4268 | WINS_EVT_RPL_STATE_ERR | WINS received a replica whose state is incorrect. For example, the state might be RELEASED or the replica might be an Internet group that does not have any members but the state is not TOMBSTONE. |
| 4289 | WINS_EVT_RECORD_NOT_OWNED | WINS is trying to update the version number of a database record that it does not own. This is a serious error if the WINS server is updating the record after a conflict. It is not a serious error if the WINS server is updating the record as a result of a request to do so from a remote WINS server. When a remote WINS server notices a conflict between an active owned entry and a replica, it requests the replica owner to update the version number of the record. It is possible that the replica is no longer owned by the remote WINS. |
| 4295 | WINS_EVT_ADJ_VERS_NO | When WINS replicated with its partners, one of the partners showed there was more data that actually existed. WINS adjusted its counter so that new registrations and updates are seen by its partners. This means that recovery did not work properly. Check which of the partners has the highest version number corresponding to the local WINS. This can be accomplished by shutting down WINS and restarting after specifying this number in the registry. |
| 4307 | WINS_EVT_RPLPULL_EXC | The WINS replicator Pull thread encountered an error while processing a request. Log entries will specify what went wrong. |
| 4312 | WINS_EVT_TERM_DUE_TIME_LMT | WINS has exceeded the wait time for all threads to terminate. The number of threads still active is given in the second DWORD of the data section. The thread that could be stuck is the replicator thread, which could be stuck because the other WINS is slow in sending data or reading data. The latter can contribute to pressure on the TCP connection on which it is trying to replicate. |
| Warning events | - | - |
| 4153 | WINS_EVT_UNABLE_TO_VERIFY | The Scavenger thread found active replicas that are required to be verified with the owner WINS server because they were older than the verify time interval. The table of owner-to-address mappings indicated the WINS was not active. |
| 4155 | WINS_EVT_REPLICA_CLASH_W_STATIC | A replica clashed with the static record, %1, in the WINS database. The replica was rejected. |
| 4161 | WINS_EVT_PARTIAL_RPL_TYPE | A nonzero replication type applies for this partner, which means only a subset of records will be replicated between the local WINS and this partner. To get records that did not replicate, either pull them by using the winscl.exe in the Windows 2000 Resource Kit, (as described in [[MSFT-ResourceKits]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245442)) or delete all owners acquired only through this partner and initiate replication after that to reacquire all their records. The partner's address is given in the second DWORD of the data section. |
| 4162 | WINS_EVT_PNR_PARTIAL_RPL_TYPE | A partner has requested only a subset of records. This means that all the records in the range requested will not be replicated. Check the partner's registry to see what replication type applies to it. The partner's address is given in the second DWORD of the data section. |
| 4163 | WINS_EVT_ADJ_MAX_RECS_AAT | WINS adjusted the Maximum Records at a time parameter of the ConsistencyCheck key. The value specified, %2, was changed to the minimum value, %1. This represents the maximum number of records that will be replicated at any one time for a consistency check. |
| 4164 | WINS_EVT_FORCE_SCV_R_T | WINS was forced to scavenge replica tombstones of a WINS. The administrator forced the scavenging by using winscl.exe. WINS does not scavenge replica tombstones unless they have timed out and the WINS has been running for at least three days. This is to ensure that the tombstones have replicated to other WINSes. In this case, the tombstones were timed out but the WINS had not been running for three days. The replica tombstones were deleted. This deletion does not constitute a problem unless there are WINS servers that are primary and backup to clients but not both Push and Pull partners of each other. If this type of WINS exists, there is a low probability that this action will result in database inconsistency but if it does, a consistent state can be achieved by initiating consistency checks by using winscl.exe. |
| Error events | - | - |
| 4166 | WINS_EVT_RPLPULL_ABNORMAL_SHUTDOWN | The replication Pull thread is shutting down due to an error. Restart WINS. |
| 4167 | WINS_EVT_RPLPUSH_ABNORMAL_SHUTDOWN | The replication Push thread is shutting down due to an error. Restart WINS. |
| 4197 | WINS_EVT_WINSOCK_BIND_ERR | An address could not bind to a socket. Make sure the TCP/IP stack is installed and running properly. This event might mean that the 'nameserver' port (specified in the services file) which is used as the default by WINS for replication and discovering other WINSes has been taken by another process or service running on this computer. There are two options: either end the other process or service, or direct WINS to use another port. If you choose the second option, set the value 'PortNo' (REG_DWORD) under the Wins\Parameters subkey in the registry to 1512. **Note** Changing the port number this way will prevent this WINS from replicating or discovering other WINSes unless they too are directed to use the same port number as this WINS. |

The following requirements and recommendations apply to a WINS server that processes a call to R_WinsTrigger:

- The R_WinsTrigger caller SHOULD have control level access. If an RPC client with a lower access level calls R_WinsTrigger, the server SHOULD return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
- The WINS service on the target WINS server MUST be in the running or paused state. If the service is in initializing or exiting state, the server SHOULD return ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL for its status.
- When R_WinsTrigger is called with trigger type WINSINTF_E_PUSH, the server queues a push replication. If the target WINS server is configured to replicate only with partners and the address of the requested replication partner is not in the server's list of push replication partners, the server SHOULD return WINSINTF_RPL_NOT_ALLOWED. The server can also return ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL for any other errors occur while it processes the request.
- The trigger type WINSINTF_E_PUSH_PROP works same way as the command WINSINTF_E_PUSH except that the update notifications that are sent as part of push replication have the propagate opcode set (see [MS-WINSRA](../MS-WINSRA/MS-WINSRA.md) section 2.2.8.
- When the R_WinsTrigger method is called with trigger type WINSINTF_E_PULL, the server queues a pull replication as specified by the *pWinsAdd* parameter. If the target WINS server is configured to replicate only with partners, and the address of the requested replication partner is not in the server's list of pull replication partners, the server SHOULD return WINSINTF_RPL_NOT_ALLOWED. Also, the server SHOULD return ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL for any other errors that occur while it processes the request.
<a id="Section_3.1.4.4"></a>
#### 3.1.4.4 R_WinsDoStaticInit (Opnum 3)

The R_WinsDoStaticInit method performs static initialization of a [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) database by registering the names specified in a data file.

DWORD R_WinsDoStaticInit(

[in] handle_t ServerHdl,

[in, unique, string] LPWSTR pDataFilePath,

[in] DWORD fDel

);

**ServerHdl:** An [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding over IP address/HostName to the WINS server. RPC uses this binding internally to resolve which WINS server the call is directed to.

**pDataFilePath:** A pointer to a [**Unicode string**](#gt_unicode-string) containing the path to a text file on the [**target WINS server**](#gt_target-wins-server). The file SHOULD contain entries that map [**NetBIOS**](#gt_netbios) names to [**IPv4 addresses in string format**](#gt_4e201ead-736f-4aed-bd66-4ff53468bf06) using the following syntax:

<IPv4 address 1> <one or more spaces> <NetBIOS name 1>

<IPv4 address 2> <one or more spaces> <NetBIOS name 2>

...

<IPv4 address N> <one or more spaces> <NetBIOS name N>

An example of this syntax can be found in the Windows **LMHOSTS** file, as specified in [MS-NBTE](../MS-NBTE/MS-NBTE.md) section 2.2.3 LMHOSTS File Syntax. See [[LMHOSTS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=200063) for more information.

If this pointer value is NULL, the target WINS server SHOULD use the following default path: "%systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\lmhosts".

**fDel:** Value specifying whether or not to delete the file specified by *pDataFilePath* from the target WINS server. A non-zero value deletes the file from the target WINS server after the database initialization is complete.

**Return Values:** A 32 bit unsigned integer value that indicates the return status. A return value of ERROR_SUCCESS (0x00000000) indicates that the operation completed successfully. Any other return value is a Win32 error code as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md). The following Win32 error codes can be returned:

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 ERROR_SUCCESS | The call was successful. |
| 0x00000FA2 ERROR_STATIC_INIT_FAILED | An error occurred during static initialization of the database file. |
| 0x00000005 ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED | The caller does not have sufficient permissions. |

**Exceptions Thrown**: No exceptions are thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

**Processing and Response Requirements**:

The following requirements and recommendations apply to a WINS server that processes a call to R_WinsDoStaticInit:

- The R_WinsDoStaticInit caller SHOULD have control level access. If an RPC client with a lower access level calls this method, the server SHOULD return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
- The WINS server retrieves the entries from the specified file and registers the retrieved names into the WINS database.
- After the WINS server finishes the initialization, it removes the file if *fDel* is set to a nonzero value.
- The WINS server SHOULD return ERROR_STATIC_INIT_FAILED if any error occurs while the server is reading the file or registering the names in the database.
<a id="Section_3.1.4.5"></a>
#### 3.1.4.5 R_WinsDoScavenging (Opnum 4)

The R_WinsDoScavenging method queues a [**scavenging**](#gt_scavenging) request on the [**target WINS server**](#gt_target-wins-server).

DWORD R_WinsDoScavenging(

[in] handle_t ServerHdl

);

**ServerHdl:** An [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding over IP address/HostName to the [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server. RPC uses this binding internally to determine which WINS server the call is directed to.

**Return Values:** A 32 bit unsigned integer that indicates the return status. A return value of ERROR_SUCCESS (0x00000000) indicates that the operation completed successfully. A nonzero return value is a Win32 error code, as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md). The following Win32 error codes can be returned:

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 ERROR_SUCCESS | The call was successful. |
| 0x00000005 ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED | The caller doesn't have sufficient permissions. |

**Exceptions Thrown**: No exceptions are thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

**Processing and Response Requirements**:

When R_WinsDoScanvenging is called, the server returns immediately without waiting for scavenging to start. The server just queues a request for the scavenging operation, and the internal state and configuration of the WINS server determine whether or not the scavenging occurs. Hence,callers to R_WinsDoScanvenging SHOULD NOT treat a return code of ERROR_SUCCESS as indicating a successful scavenging operation. Instead, callers SHOULD rely on WINS event logs to determine whether or not the scavenging operation succeeded. The following table lists the events that indicate the status of scavenging.

| Event ID | Event Name | Event Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Informational events | - | - |
| 4143 | WINS_EVT_SCV_RECS | WINS scavenged its records in the WINS database. The number of records scavenged is given in the data section. |
| 4144 | WINS_EVT_SCV_RPLTOMB | WINS scavenged replica tombstones in the WINS database. The number of records scavenged is given in the data section. |
| 4247 | WINS_EVT_SCV_EXC | The WINS Scavenger thread encountered an error. |
| 4250 | WINS_EVT_SCV_ERR | The WINS Scavenger thread could not scavenge a record. This record will be ignored. The Scavenger will continue to the next available record. Check the application log for the Exchange component, ESENT. |
| 4269 | WINS_EVT_UNABLE_TO_CHG_PRIORITY | The Scavenger thread was unable to change its priority level. |
| 4288 | WINS_EVT_CLEANUP_OWNADDTBL_EXC | The Scavenger thread encountered an error while cleaning up the owner-address table. It will try again after the Verify interval has elapsed. |
| 4328 | WINS_EVT_ADMIN_SCVENGING_INITIATED | Administrator '%1' has initiated a scavenging operation. |
| 4329 | WINS_EVT_SCVENGING_STARTED | The WINS server has started a scavenging operation. |
| 4330 | WINS_EVT_SCVENGING_COMPLETED | The WINS server has completed the scavenging operation. |
| 5001 | WINS_EVT_SCV_RANGE | WINS is scavenging the locally owned records from the database. The version number range that is scavenged is given in the data section, in the second to fifth words, in the order: from_version_number (low word, high word) to_version_number (low word, high word). |
| 5002 | WINS_EVT_SCV_CHUNK | WINS is scavenging a chunk of N records in the version number range from X to Y. N, X and Y (low word, high word for version numbers) are given in the second to sixth words in the data section. |
| Warning events | - | - |
| 4150 | WINS_EVT_ADJ_TIME_INTVL_R | WINS adjusted the scavenging-related time interval, %1, so that it is compatible with the replication time intervals. The adjusted value for this scavenging parameter is given in the data section (second DWORD). This value was computed by WINS using an algorithm that MAY use the maximum replication time interval specified. The current value achieves a good balance between consistency of databases across the network of WINS servers and the performance of the WINS servers. |
| 4151 | WINS_EVT_ADJ_TIME_INTVL | WINS adjusted the scavenging-related time interval, %1. The adjusted value for this scavenging parameter is given in the data section (second DWORD). This value was computed by WINS using an algorithm that tries to achieve a good balance between consistency of databases across the network of WINS servers and the performance of the WINS servers. |
| 4153 | WINS_EVT_UNABLE_TO_VERIFY | The Scavenger thread found active replicas that needed to be verified with the owning WINS server because they were older than the verify time interval. The table of owner-to-address mappings indicated the WINS was not active. |
| 4164 | WINS_EVT_FORCE_SCV_R_T | WINS was forced to scavenge replica tombstones of a WINS. The person with administrative rights on the computer forced the scavenging by using the winscl.exe. WINS does not scavenge replica tombstones unless they have timed out and WINS has been running for at least three days (this ensures that the tombstones have replicated to other WINS). In this case, the tombstones were timed out but the WINS had not been running for three days. The replica tombstones were deleted. This deletion does not constitute a problem unless there are WINS servers that are primary and backup to clients but not both Push and Pull partners of each other. With the preceding WINS scenario, there is a low probability that this action will result in database inconsistency but if it does, a consistent state can be achieved by initiating consistency checks by using the winscl.exe. |

The following requirements and recommendations apply to a WINS server that processes a call to [R_WinsDoScavenging](#Section_3.1.4.3):

- Callers to R_WinsDoScavenging SHOULD have control level access. If an RPC client with a lower access level calls R_WinsDoScavenging, the server SHOULD return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
- The WINS server queues a request on the target WINS server for the scavenging operation, and the method returns immediately with ERROR_SUCCESS as the status code.

**Exceptions Thrown**: No exceptions are thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

**Processing and Response Requirements**:

When R_WinsPullRange is called, the server returns immediately without waiting for the actual pull. It just queues a request for the pull operation, and the actual pull starts at a time determined by the current state and configuration of the target WINS server. Hence, R_WinsPullRange callers SHOULD NOT treat an ERROR_SUCCESS return value as indicating a successful pull operation. Instead, callers SHOULD rely on WINS event logs to determine whether or not the pull operation succeeded. The following table lists the events that indicate the status of a pull operation.

| Event ID | Event Name | Event Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Informational events | - | - |
| 4104 | WINS_EVT_NO_PULL_RECS | There are no pull records. |
| 4124 | WINS_EVT_UPD_NTF_NOT_ACCEPTED | The WINS server received an update notification from the nonconfigured WINS server at the address, %1. The WINS server rejected it. This means the remote WINS server is not in the list of Push partners (WINS servers under the Pull key) and the administrator has prohibited (by using the registry) replication with nonconfigured WINS servers. To have this WINS server accept update notifications from nonconfigured WINS servers, set the Wins\Parameters\RplOnlyWCnfPnrs value in the registry to zero. |
| 4126 | WINS_EVT_ADD_VERS_MAP_REQ_NOT_ACCEPTED | The WINS server received a pull request from the nonconfigured WINS server with the address, %1. The WINS server rejected it since the remote WINS server is not in the list of Pull partners (WINS servers under the Pull key) and the administrator has prohibited (using the registry) replication with nonconfigured partners. If you want this WINS server to accept update notifications from WINS servers not in the pull partner list, set the "replication only with configured partners" value in the registry to zero. |
| 4141 | WINS_EVT_REC_PULLED | WINS pulled records from a WINS while doing %1. The partner's address and the owner's address whose records were pulled are in the data section (second and third DWORD respectively). The number of records pulled is the fourth DWORD. |
| 4142 | WINS_EVT_CC_NO_RECS | WINS performed a consistency check on the records. The number of records pulled, the address of the WINS whose records were pulled, and the address of the WINS from which these records were pulled are given in the second, third, and fourth DWORDs in the data section. |
| 4231 | WINS_EVT_CANT_QUERY_PULL_KEY | WINS could not get information about the Pull key. Check whether the permissions on the key are set properly, system resources are low, or the registry is having a problem. |
| 4235 | WINS_EVT_CANT_OPEN_PULL_SUBKEY | WINS could not open a Pull subkey. Check whether the permissions on the key are set properly, system resources are low, or the registry is having a problem. |
| 4237 | WINS_EVT_CANT_GET_PULL_TIMEINT | WINS could not get the time interval from a Pull record. |
| 4243 | WINS_EVT_RPLPULL_PUSH_NTF_EXC | WINS Pull thread encountered an error during the process of sending a push notification to another WINS. The error code is in the data section. |
| 4255 | WINS_EVT_PUSH_PNR_INVALID_ADD | WINS has been asked to pull its entries. Check all the Pull subkeys of this WINS. |
| 4273 | WINS_EVT_PULL_RANGE_EXC | An error was encountered while trying to service a pull range request from a remote WINS. The exception code is the second DWORD of the data section. |
| 4284 | WINS_EVT_EXC_PULL_TRIG_PROC | WINS encountered an exception while processing a pull trigger. |
| Warning events | - | - |
| 4161 | WINS_EVT_PARTIAL_RPL_TYPE | A nonzero replication type applies for this partner. This means only a subset of records will be replicated between the local WINS and this partner. To get records that did not replicate, either pull them by using the winscl.exe in the Windows 2000 Resource Kit (as described in [[MSFT-ResourceKits]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245442)), or delete all owners acquired only through this partner and then initiate replication to reacquire all their records. The partner's address is given in the second DWORD of the data section. |
| Error events | - | - |
| 4178 | WINS_EVT_CANT_OPEN_PULL_KEY | The WINS Pull configuration key could not be created or opened. Check to see if the permissions on the key are set properly, system resources are low, or the registry is having a problem. |
| 4194 | WINS_EVT_CANT_CREATE_NTF_SOCK | WINS could not create the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) socket to listen for Connection notification messages sent by another Pull thread in the local WINS. |

The following requirements and recommendations apply to a WINS server that processes a call to R_WinsPullRange:

- R_WinsPullRange callers SHOULD have control level access. If an RPC client with a lower access level calls this method, the server SHOULD return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
- The value of *MinVersNo* MUST be less than or equal to the value of *MaxVersNo*. Otherwise, the server SHOULD return ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL.
- If the target WINS server is configured to pull records only from configured partners, the WINS server address given in *pWinsAdd* MUST have been configured as a pull partner for the target WINS server. Otherwise, the server SHOULD return ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL.
- When the client queues a request to pull the records owned by the server whose address is given in *pOwnerAdd* from the WINS server whose address is given in *pWinsAdd*, the RPC call SHOULD return immediately without waiting for the replication operation to complete.

**Processing and Response Requirements**:

Clients with any access level can call this method.

The following requirements and recommendations apply to a WINS server that processes a call to [R_WinsGetBrowserNames](#Section_3.1.4.3):

- This method retrieves all browser name records in the target WINS server database.
- If the **Browser name cache** abstract data element (section [3.1.1](#Section_3.1.1)) has been populated, and less than 3 minutes have elapsed since it was last updated, this method SHOULD return the records from the cache by using the *pNames* parameter.
- If this method call is being made for the first time, or if 3 minutes or more have elapsed since the **Browser name cache** was last updated, the cache SHOULD be refreshed by fetching records from the database, and the contents of the cache are returned.
- If any error occurs while retrieving the records, the service SHOULD return an ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL error code.
The R_WinsGetBrowserNames caller is responsible for freeing the memory pointed to by *pRecs->pRow->pName* and *pRecs->pRow->pAdd* for each record, then using the **midl_user_free** function (section [3](#Section_1.3)) to free the *pRecs->pRow* and *pRecs* pointers themselves.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.19"></a>
#### 3.1.4.19 R_WinsGetDbRecsByName (Opnum 18)

**Processing and Response Requirements**:

The following requirements and recommendations apply to a WINS server that processes a call to [R_WinsGetDbRecsByName](#Section_3.1.4.3):

- The RPC method caller SHOULD have query-level access.<11> If an RPC client with a lower access level calls this method, the server SHOULD return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
- This method returns all records whose owner address matches the address specified in *pWinsAdd*. If *pName* points to a valid name, the database search starts from the record after the record whose name matches the valid name. If the name that *pName* points to does not match the name for any database records, the database search starts from the beginning of the database.
- A maximum of 5,000 records can be retrieved in a single call.
- If the owner's address is specified and if the server can't find this address in its [**owner version map**](#gt_owner-version-map), the server returns error ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL error.
- If no records match the search criteria, the server returns an ERROR_REC_NON_EXISTENT error. For any other error conditions, the server returns an ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL error.
- Refer to [Retrieving All the Records of a WINS Database (section 4.6)](#Section_4.6) to see how to use R_WinsGetDbRecsByName to retrieve all the records of a database.

DWORD R_WinsStatusWHdl(

[in, ref] WINSIF_HANDLE ServerHdl,

[in] WINSINTF_CMD_E Cmd_e,

[in, out, ref] PWINSINTF_RESULTS_NEW_T pResults

<a id="Section_3.1.4.22"></a>
#### 3.1.4.22 R_WinsDoScavengingNew (Opnum 21)

The R_WinsDoScavengingNew method requests a specific [**scavenging**](#gt_scavenging) operation on the [**target WINS server**](#gt_target-wins-server).

DWORD R_WinsDoScavengingNew(

[in] handle_t ServerHdl,

[in, ref] PWINSINTF_SCV_REQ_T pScvReq

);

**ServerHdl:** An [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding over IP address/HostName to the [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server. RPC uses this binding internally to determine which WINS server the call is directed to.

**Exceptions Thrown**: No exceptions SHOULD be thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

**Processing and Response Requirements**:

When [R_WinsDoScanvengingNew](#Section_3.1.4.5) is called, the method returns immediately without waiting for scavenging to start. The server just queues a request for the scavenging operation; the internal state and configuration of the WINS server and the value of the *fForce* member in the WINSINTF_SCV_REQ_T structure (section 2.2.2.12) determine whether the scavenging occurs. Hence, callers to R_WinsDoScanvengingNew SHOULD NOT treat a return code of ERROR_SUCCESS as indicating a successful scavenging operation. Instead, callers SHOULD rely on WINS event logs to determine whether or not the scavenging operation succeeded. The following table lists the events that indicate the status of scavenging.

| Event ID | Event Name | Event Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Informational events | - | - |
| 4143 | WINS_EVT_SCV_RECS | WINS scavenged its records in the WINS database. The number of records scavenged is listed in the data section. |
| 4144 | WINS_EVT_SCV_RPLTOMB | WINS scavenged replica tombstones in the WINS database. The number of records Scavenged is in the data section. |
| 4247 | WINS_EVT_SCV_EXC | The WINS Scavenger thread encountered an error. |
| 4250 | WINS_EVT_SCV_ERR | The WINS Scavenger thread could not scavenge a record. This record is ignored and the Scavenger continues to the next available record. Check the application log for the Exchange component, ESENT. |
| 4269 | WINS_EVT_UNABLE_TO_CHG_PRIORITY | The Scavenger thread was unable to change its priority level. |
| 4288 | WINS_EVT_CLEANUP_OWNADDTBL_EXC | The Scavenger thread encountered an error while cleaning up the owner-address table. It will try again after the Verify interval has elapsed. |
| 4328 | WINS_EVT_ADMIN_SCVENGING_INITIATED | Administrator '%1' has initiated a scavenging operation. |
| 4329 | WINS_EVT_SCVENGING_STARTED | The WINS server has started a scavenging operation. |
| 4330 | WINS_EVT_SCVENGING_COMPLETED | The WINS server has completed the scavenging operation. |
| 5001 | WINS_EVT_SCV_RANGE | WINS is scavenging the locally owned records from the database. The version number range that is scavenged is in the data section, in the second to fifth words, in this order: from_version_number (low word, high word) to_version_number (low word, high word). |
| 5002 | WINS_EVT_SCV_CHUNK | WINS is scavenging a chunk of N records in the version number range from X to Y. N, X ,and Y (low word, high word for version numbers) are listed in the second to sixth words in the data section. |
| Warning events | - | - |
| 4150 | WINS_EVT_ADJ_TIME_INTVL_R | WINS adjusted the scavenging related time interval, %1, so that it is compatible with the replication time intervals. The adjusted value for this scavenging parameter is given in the data section (second DWORD). This value was computed by WINS using an algorithm that MAY use the maximum replication time interval specified. The current value achieves a balance between consistency of databases across the network of WINS servers and the performance of the WINS servers. |
| 4151 | WINS_EVT_ADJ_TIME_INTVL | WINS adjusted the scavenging related time interval, %1. The adjusted value for this scavenging parameter is listed in the data section (second DWORD). This value was computed by WINS using an algorithm that tries to achieve a balance between consistency of databases across the network of WINS servers and the performance of the WINS servers. |
| 4153 | WINS_EVT_UNABLE_TO_VERIFY | The Scavenger thread found active replicas that needed to be verified with the owner WINS server because they were older than the verify time interval. The table of owner-to-address mappings indicated the WINS was not active. |
| 4164 | WINS_EVT_FORCE_SCV_R_T | WINS was forced to scavenge replica tombstones of a WINS. The administrator on the computer forced the scavenging using winscl.exe. WINS does not scavenge replica tombstones unless they have timed out and the WINS has been running for at least three days. This ensures that the tombstones have replicated to other WINSes). In this case, the tombstones were timed out but the WINS had not been up for three days. The replica tombstones were deleted. This deletion does not constitute a problem unless the WINS servers are primary andbackup to clients but not both Push and Pull partners of each other. If there are such WINSes, there is a low probability that this action will result in database inconsistency, but if it does, a consistent state can be achieved by initiating consistency checks using winscl.exe. |

The following requirements and recommendations apply to a WINS server that processes a call to [R_WinsDoScavengingNew](#Section_3.1.4.3):

- Callers to R_WinsDoScavengingNew SHOULD have control level access. If an RPC client with a lower access level calls R_WinsDoScavengingNew, the server SHOULD return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
- The WINS server queues a request on the target WINS server for the scavenging operation, and the method returns immediately with ERROR_SUCCESS as the status code.

## 3.2 winsi2 Server Details

The methods supported by the **winsi2** interface are specified in [Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules (section 3.2.4)](#Section_3.1.4).

<a id="Section_3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation can maintain to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

A [**NetBIOS name server (NBNS)**](#gt_netbios-name-server-nbns) needs to maintain the following data structures:

**Name record**: A data structure that contains a name and the associated attributes.

**Name records collection**: A collection of all [**name records**](#gt_name-record) that are either registered by this NBNS server or obtained by replication.

**Global version counter**: A 64-bit unsigned integer that tracks the version number that is given to the next record to be updated.

**Server configuration**: Parameters maintained in persistent storage include the following:

- Refresh interval
- [**Extinction interval**](#gt_extinction-interval)
- Extinction timeout
- Verify interval
- Process priority class
- Number of worker threads
<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

No timers are required beyond those used internally by [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) to implement resiliency to network outages, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.2.3.2.1.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

A [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) [winsi2](#Section_3.1.4) remote protocol server MUST be initialized by registering the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interface and listening on the dynamically allocated port assigned by RPC, as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1). The client MUST connect to a well-known RPC port on the WINS server to determine the endpoint of winsi2. Before any client connection, the WINS server MUST wait for WINS winsi2 to register with RPC before any clients can establish a connection.

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The winsi2 interface provides methods that remotely configure, manage, and monitor a [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server.

Methods in RPC Opnum Order

| Method | Description |

[in, ref] PWINSINTF_ADD_T pWinsAdd,

[in] WINSINTF_VERS_NO_T MinVersNo,

[in] WINSINTF_VERS_NO_T MaxVersNo

);

**ServerHdl:** An [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding over IP address/HostName to the [**WINS server**](#gt_wins-server). RPC uses this binding internally to resolve which WINS server the call is directed to.

**pWinsAdd:** A pointer to the address of the [**owner WINS server**](#gt_owner-wins-server) whose records are to be tombstoned. This value MUST NOT be NULL.

**MinVersNo:** The lower bound on the range of version numbers that identifies the range of records to be tombstoned.

**MaxVersNo:** The upper bound on the range of version numbers that identifies the range of records to be tombstoned.

**Return Values:** A 32 bit unsigned integer value that indicates the return status. A return value of ERROR_SUCCESS (0x00000000) indicates that the operation completed successfully. Any other return value is a Win32 error code as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md). The following Win32 error codes can be returned:

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 ERROR_SUCCESS | The call was successful. |
| 0x00000005 ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED | The caller does not have sufficient permissions. |
| 0x00000FA0 ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL | An error occurred while processing the RPC call. |

**Exceptions Thrown**: No exceptions SHOULD be thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

**Processing and Response Requirements**:

The following requirements and recommendations apply to a WINS server that processes a call to R_WinsTombstoneDbRecs:

- The R_WinsTombstoneDbRecs caller SHOULD have control-level access. If an RPC client with a lower access level calls this method, the server SHOULD return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
- If the specified owner WINS server address is not found in the [**owner-version map**](#gt_owner-version-map) table, the server SHOULD return ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL.
- If any error occurs during the retrieval or updating of database records, the server SHOULD return ERROR_WINS_INTERNAL.
- The server changes the state of the matching records to tombstoned. It also updates the version number and the ownership of these records so that the version number and record ownership are replicated on the partner WINS servers when replication takes place.
- The time stamp of the matching record is set to a string with the following format:
current time + tombstone timeout configured on the target WINS server

- If both *MinVersNo* and *MaxVersNo* are zero, all records matching the given [**owner**](#gt_owner) address are tombstoned.

**ServerHdl:** An [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding over IP address/HostName to the [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server. RPC uses this binding internally to resolve which WINS server the call is directed to.

**Access:** Pointer to the access level value. This value MUST not be NULL. The following values are possible as output.

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| No access | 0 |
| Control level access | 1 |
| Query level access | 2 |

**Return Values:** A 32-bit unsigned integer value that indicates the return status. A return value of ERROR_SUCCESS (0x00000000) indicates that the operation completed successfully. Any other return value is a Win32 error code as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md). The following Win32 error codes can be returned:

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 ERROR_SUCCESS | The call was successful. |

**Exceptions Thrown**: No exceptions SHOULD be thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

**Processing and Response Requirements**:

[**Clients**](#gt_client) with any access level can call this method.

<a id="Section_4.5"></a>
## 4.5 Querying a Record from a WINS Database

The following example illustrates the use of the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) methods defined in this specification to query a record from the database of a [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server. This example assumes that the WINS database contained by the specified server has an active [**multihomed (1)**](#gt_multihomed) [**dynamic record**](#gt_dynamic-record) named "WINS-TEST-00001" mapped to two IP addresses: 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2. IP address 192.168.1.1 has [**node type p**](#gt_p-node), and its time stamp set to 0x61. IP address 192.168.1.2 has a version ID type and a time stamp set to 0x101E. The client calls the RPC method [R_WinsRecordAction (section 3.1.4.1)](#Section_3.1.4.1) with the following parameters:

- *ServerHdl* set to the endpoint of the WINS server on which the R_WinsRecordAction method is executed.
- *ppRecAction* pointing to a structure of type [WINSINTF_RECORD_ACTION_T (section 2.2.2.3)](#Section_2.2.2.3), with members set as follows:
- **Cmd_e** to WINSINTF_E_QUERY.
- **pName** to point to the string "WINS-TEST-00001" followed by a [**NetBIOS suffix**](#gt_netbios-suffix) of 0x00.
- **NameLen** to 16.
- All other members are used for output, which the server assigns as follows:
- **TypOfRec_e** contains 3.
- **NoOfAdds** contains 2.
- **pAdd** points to two IP addresses: 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2.
- **VersNo** contains 0x61.
- **NodeTyp** contains 1.
- **OwnerId** contains the [**owner**](#gt_owner) IP address of the matching record.
- **State_e** contains zero ([**ACTIVE**](#gt_active)).
- **fStatic** contains zero.
- **TimeStamp** contains 0x101E.
<a id="Section_4.6"></a>
## 4.6 Retrieving All of the Records of a WINS Database

This example illustrates the use of the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) methods defined in this specification to retrieve all the records from the database of a [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server.

- The client calls the [R_WinsGetDbRecsByName](#Section_3.1.4.19) method repeatedly with the following parameters.
- Set *pWinsAdd* to NULL, *Location* to zero, *pName* to NULL, *NameLen* to zero, *fStaticOnly*, to 4 and *NoOfRecsDesired* to the desired number of records. As noted in the description of R_WinsGetDbRecsByName, the server resets the *NoOfRecsDesired* parameter to 5,000 if the parameter's value is greater than 5,000.
- Check how many R_WinsGetDbRecsByName has returned by looking at the value in the *NoOfRecs* field. If this value is less than the *NoOfRecsDesired* value, the retrieval is complete. Otherwise, if the number of returned values is the same as the value of *NoOfRecsDesired*, call to the R_WinsGetDbRecsByName with the following parameter settings:
- Set *pWinsAdd* to NULL, *Location* to 0, *pName* to the name of the last record retrieved in the previous iteration, *NameLen* to the length of *pName*, *fStaticOnly* to 4, and *NoOfRecsDesired* to the desired number of records.
- Repeated this procedure until the value of *NoOfRecs* is less than the value of *NoOfRecsDesired*.
<a id="Section_4.7"></a>
## 4.7 Deleting All the Records of an Owner from a Particular WINS Server

This example illustrates the use of the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) methods defined in this specification to delete all the records of an [**owner**](#gt_owner) from the [**target WINS server**](#gt_target-wins-server).

The client calls the RPC method [R_WinsDelDbRecs](#Section_3.1.4.9) with the following parameters:

- The endpoint of the [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server on which R_WinsDelDbRecs is executed (or from which the records are deleted as *ServerHdl*.
- Set *MinVersNo*, *MaxVersNo* and *pAdd->Type* to zero 0, *pAdd->Len* to 4, and *pAdd->IPAdd* to the IP address of the WINS server whose records are to be deleted.
- The successful completion of the R_WinsDelDbRecs call deletes all the records for an owner from the target WINS server database.
<a id="Section_4.8"></a>
## 4.8 Deleting All the Records from a Particular WINS Server

This example illustrates the use of the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) methods defined in this specification to delete all records from the [**target WINS server**](#gt_target-wins-server).

The client calls the RPC method [R_WinsStatusNew](#Section_3.1.4.20) with the following parameters:

- The endpoint of the [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server on which the RPC method is executed, or from which the records are deleted, as *ServerHdl*.
- Set *Cmd_e* to *WINSINTF_E_CONFIG_ALL_MAPS*.
- The output of the call to R_WinsStatusNew, *pResults*, contains the list of owner addresses in the database of the target WINS server. For each owner address in *pResults->pAddVersMaps*, call the RPC method [R_WinsDelDbRecs (section 3.1.4.9)](#Section_3.1.4.9) by setting the parameters as follows:
- Set *MinVersNo*, *MaxVersNo*, and *pAdd->Type* to 0.
- Set *pAdd->Len* to 4.
- Set *pAdd->IPAdd* to pResults->pAddVersMaps[*i*]->Add, where **i** denotes the *i*th iteration.
<a id="Section_4.9"></a>
## 4.9 Triggering a Pull Replication Between Two WINS Servers

This example illustrates the use of the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) methods defined in this specification to trigger a pull [**replication**](#gt_replication) from one [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server to another.

The client calls the RPC method [R_WinsTrigger](#Section_3.1.4.3) with the following parameters:

- Set the value of *ServerHdl* to the endpoint of the WINS server on which the pull replication is queued.
- Set *TrigType_e* and *pAdd->Type* to 0, *pAdd->Len* to 4 and *pAdd->IPAdd* to the IP address of the WINS server that serves as the partner for the pull replication.
- A return value of ERROR_SUCCESS means that the pull request has been queued successfully.
<a id="Section_4.10"></a>
## 4.10 Backing Up a WINS Server Database

To back up the [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server database, the client calls the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) method [R_WinsBackup](#Section_3.1.4.8) with the following parameters:

- Set the value of *ServerHdl* to the endpoint of the WINS server on which the backup is performed.
- Set *pBackupPath* to the path on the server where the database is backed up.
- A return value of ERROR_SUCCESS indicates that the backup has been successful.

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

RAIW allows any user to establish a connection to the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) server. The protocol uses the underlying RPC protocol to retrieve the identity of the method caller as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md). Clients create an authenticated RPC connection, and servers use this identity to perform specific access checks.

[**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) server data and WINS server operations specified by this implementation are protected by access checks based on the identity of the RPC client.

Servers that implement this specification do not allow anonymous RPC connections and protect WINS access to all data and operations with access control checks based on client identity.

Clients or servers that implement this specification do not use RPC over named pipes because it is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. RPC over TCP/IP is used instead.

Servers that implement this protocol require clients to request RPC_C_AUTHN_WINNT, and servers enforce this requirement in order to protect the privacy of the communication with clients.

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 2.1.1: Windows NT 4.0 operating system: The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol does not define query-level access; the only access level available is control-level access. Clients that invoke [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) have control-level access.

<2> Section 2.2.2.7: In Windows 2000 Server operating system and later if the value of the **WINSPriorityClass** member is other than NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS or HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS, the system assumes the latter.

<3> Section 3.1.4.1: Windows NT 4.0: The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS Protocol uses implicit binding, in which the RPC run-time library maintains the handle internally. No RPC methods except [R_WinsTombStoneDbRecs](#Section_3.2.4.1), [R_WinsTerm](#Section_3.1.4.7), and [R_WinsGetBrowserNames](#Section_3.1.4.15) take *ServerHdl* as a parameter.

<4> Section 3.1.4.1: Windows NT 4.0: The RPC method caller is required to have control-level access regardless of the action used.

<5> Section 3.1.4.1: In Windows 2000 Server and later, a maximum of 25 IP address mappings are allowed for a multihomed or special group [**Name Record**](#gt_name-record).

<6> Section 3.1.4.2: Windows NT 4.0: The [R_WinStatus](#Section_3.1.4.20) caller is required to have control-level access regardless of the command used.

<7> Section 3.1.4.6: Windows NT 4.0: The RPC method caller is required to have control-level access regardless of the command used.

<8> Section 3.1.4.10: The execution of [R_WinsPullRange](#Section_3.1.4.10) by a client with sufficient access permissions can cause the [**WINS**](#gt_windows-internet-name-service-wins) service on the [**target WINS server**](#gt_target-wins-server) to restart.

<9> Section 3.1.4.14: Windows NT 4.0: The [R_WinsGetNameAndAdd](#Section_3.1.4.3) caller is required to have control-level access regardless of the command used.

<10> Section 3.1.4.14: Windows NT 4.0: The R_WinsGetNameAndAdd caller does not need access permissions to call this method.

<11> Section 3.1.4.19: Windows NT 4.0: The RPC method caller is required to have control-level access regardless of the command used.

<12> Section 3.2.4.2: Windows NT 4.0: This RPC method is not supported.
