# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Remote Desktop Protocol: Telemetry Virtual Channel Extension to the Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting, as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md). The telemetry protocol defined in section [2.2](#Section_2.2) is used to send client performance metrics to the server, thus providing a way to collate statistics about the quality of the RDP experience.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_ansi-character"></a>
**ANSI character**: An 8-bit Windows-1252 character set unit.

<a id="gt_little-endian"></a>
**little-endian**: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the least significant byte stored in the memory location with the lowest address.

<a id="gt_terminal-server"></a>
**terminal server**: A computer on which terminal services is running.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.2"></a>
## 1.2 References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the [Errata](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=850906).

### 1.2.2 Informative References

None.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Telemetry Virtual Channel Extension consists of a single client-to-server PDU (section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1)) sent over an RDP dynamic virtual channel (section [2.1](#Section_2.1)) every time a connection is established.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Telemetry Virtual Channel Extension is embedded in a dynamic virtual channel transport, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) sections 1 to 3.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Telemetry Virtual Channel Extension operates only after the dynamic virtual channel transport is fully established. If the dynamic virtual channel transport is terminated, the Remote Desktop Protocol: Telemetry Virtual Channel Extension is also terminated. The protocol is terminated by closing the underlying virtual channel. For details about closing the dynamic virtual channel, see [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) section 3.1.5.2.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Telemetry Virtual Channel Extension is applicable in scenarios where a mechanism to transmit telemetry data to a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) is required.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

None.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

None.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Telemetry Virtual Channel Extension is designed to operate over a dynamic virtual channel, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) sections 1 to 3. The dynamic virtual channel name is the null-terminated [**ANSI character**](#gt_ansi-character) string "Microsoft::Windows::RDS::Telemetry". The usage of channel names in the context of opening a dynamic virtual channel is specified in [MS-RDPEDYC] section 2.2.2.1.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

The following sections specify the Remote Desktop Protocol: Telemetry Virtual Channel Extension message syntax.

All multiple-byte fields within a message MUST be marshaled in [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) byte order, unless otherwise specified.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 RDP_TELEMETRY_PDU

The **RDP_TELEMETRY_PDU** message is a client-to-server PDU that is used to transmit metrics with respect to the time it took the client to complete a fully functional connection to the server.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-7: "Id"
  8-15: "Length"
  16-47: "PromptForCredentialsMillis"
  48-79: "PromptForCredentialsDoneMillis"
  80-111: "GraphicsChannelOpenedMillis"
  112-143: "FirstGraphicsReceivedMillis"
```

**Id (1 byte):** An 8-bit unsigned integer that MUST contain the value 0x01.

**Length (1 byte):** An 8-bit unsigned integer that specifies the length, in bytes, of the PDU. This field MUST be set to 0x12.

**PromptForCredentialsMillis (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the difference, in milliseconds, between the time when the connection was initiated, and the time when a credentials prompt dialog was shown to the user. This value MUST be zero if no credentials prompt dialog was displayed.

**PromptForCredentialsDoneMillis (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the difference, in milliseconds, between the time when the connection was initiated, and the time when credentials were successfully provided by the user. This value MUST be zero if no credentials prompt dialog was displayed.

**GraphicsChannelOpenedMillis (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the difference, in milliseconds, between the time when the connection was initiated, and the time when the Remote Desktop Protocol: Graphics Pipeline Extension dynamic virtual channel ([MS-RDPEGFX](../MS-RDPEGFX/MS-RDPEGFX.md) section 2.1) was accepted by the client.

**FirstGraphicsReceivedMillis (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the difference in milliseconds, between the time when the connection was initiated, and the time when the first Desktop Protocol: Graphics Pipeline Extension graphics message ([MS-RDPEGFX] section 2.2) was received by the client.
