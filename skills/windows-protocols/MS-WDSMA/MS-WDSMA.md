# 1 Introduction

WDS Multicast Application Protocol is a single server, multiple client protocol.

The protocol uses the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol [MS-WDSMT](#Section_2.1) for transmission of content to multiple clients. The protocol relies on services provided by the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol [MS-WDSMT] to ensure all pieces of content are delivered to all clients in a [**multicast**](#gt_multicast) session.

The protocol allows clients to join the multicast session at any point during the lifetime of the multicast session, and still be able to get all pieces of the content.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_block-number"></a>
**block number**: The content is divided into equal blocks. The first block is assigned a value of 1, and each successive block is incrementally assigned the next higher value.

<a id="gt_multicast"></a>
**multicast**: The ability of a transport protocol, such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP), to deliver messages to a group of recipients simultaneously without duplication of message unless the link to recipients is split.

<a id="gt_network-byte-order"></a>
**network byte order**: The order in which the bytes of a multiple-byte number are transmitted on a network, most significant byte first (in big-endian storage). This may or may not match the order in which numbers are normally stored in memory for a particular processor.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.2"></a>
## 1.2 References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the [Errata](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=850906).

## 1.3 Overview

WDS Multicast Application Protocol uses the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol [MS-WDSMT](#Section_2.1) to deliver all pieces of the content to all clients in a [**multicast**](#gt_multicast) session.

When the first client joins the multicast session, the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol notifies the WDS Multicast Application Protocol using a trigger. After such a Trigger is received, the WDS Multicast Application Protocol uses the steps below to ensure delivery of all pieces of content to the clients in the multicast session:

- The WDS Multicast Application Protocol server sends packets using the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol to query all clients for the block ranges that each client is missing from the content. The WDS Multicast Application Protocol on each client, on receiving such a packet, returns a reply to the server with the list of block ranges that the client is missing. The WDS Multicast Application Protocol on the server-side receives all replies from clients via the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol.
- WDS Multicast Application Protocol on the server-side sends the missing pieces to all clients using WDS Multicast Transport Protocol.
- After all missing pieces have been transmitted, WDS Multicast Application Protocol on the server starts over from step 1.
<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The WDS Multicast Application Protocol is established via the WDS Multicast Session Initiation Protocol [MS-WDSMSI](../MS-WDSMSI/MS-WDSMSI.md).

The WDS Multicast Application Protocol uses the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol [MS-WDSMT](#Section_2.1) as its transport to send the pieces of content to all clients in the multicast session.

The following diagram specifies the relationship among the WDS Multicast Application Protocol and other protocols:

![Relationship among the WDS Multicast Application Protocol and associated protocols](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Relationship among the WDS Multicast Application Protocol and associated protocols

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The protocol relies on the WDS Multicast Session Initiation Protocol [MS-WDSMSI](../MS-WDSMSI/MS-WDSMSI.md) to provide each client with the details of the content and parameters required for the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol [MS-WDSMT](#Section_2.1).

The protocol assumes that the WDS Multicast Session Initiation Protocol has created and initialized instances of the WDS Multicast Application Protocol and the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The WDS Multicast Application Protocol is applicable when an application has to download content from a server using a multicast session.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This protocol does not have any explicit versioning negotiation.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol does not have any vendor-extensible fields.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

## 2.1 Transport

The packet contents for the WDS Multicast Application Protocol MUST be specified in [**network byte order**](#gt_network-byte-order) unless noted otherwise.

The WDS Multicast Application Protocol uses the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol [MS-WDSMT](#Section_2.1) for transport of the content to all clients in the [**multicast**](#gt_multicast) session.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Packet Header

Each packet of the WDS Multicast Application Protocol MUST specify the packet header as follows:

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

**SessionState:** Specifies the current state for the [**multicast**](#gt_multicast) session as defined below.

| State | Description |
| --- | --- |
| QueryState | The WDS Multicast Application Protocol is actively querying the clients for block ranges of content that each client is missing. |

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The WDS Multicast Application Protocol drives the processing based on lower-layer triggered events generated by the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol [MS-WDSMT](#Section_2.1).

The following table specifies the lower-layer triggered events generated by the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol and their respective processing:

| Lower-layer triggered events | Processing description |
| --- | --- |

| Terminate trigger | Section [3.1.5.4](#Section_3.1.5.4) |

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>
#### 3.1.5.1 Query State

Server MUST remove all packets stored in **ClientCNTCIRPackets** (section [3.1.1](#Section_3.2.1)).

Server MUST construct a SRVCIR packet (section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2)) and MUST send the packet using **POLL Trigger** to the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol. The timeout value provided by **POLL Trigger** MUST be used to set the expiry time for the **Query Timer**.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1.1"></a>
##### 3.1.5.1.1 POLLACK Trigger

POLLACK Trigger MUST provide the payload received from the client. Server MUST validate that the payload specifies a CNTCIR packet as specified in section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3) and MUST add the packet to **ClientCNTCIRPackets** (section [3.1.1](#Section_3.2.1)).

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2"></a>
#### 3.1.5.2 Data State

The server MUST start from the first [**block number**](#gt_block-number) of the first block range specified by **MissingBlockRanges** (section [3.1.1](#Section_3.2.1)) and MUST process for each block number as specified below:

- The server MUST compute the offset into the content as follows:
**BlockOffset** = **BlockNumber** x **BlockSize** (section 3.1.1)

- The server MUST read the bytes of data from the content at offset specified by **BlockOffset**. The number of bytes read MUST be equal to the **BlockSize** (section 3.1.1), unless the read operation reaches to the last byte of the content in which case there will be fewer bytes read.
- The server MUST construct a DATA packet and set the fields of the DATA packet as specified below:
**BlockNumber**: MUST be set to the **BlockNumber**.

**DataLen**: MUST be set to the number of bytes of data read from the content.

**Data**: MUST be set the bytes of data read from the content.

- The server MUST send the **Data Trigger** to the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol providing the constructed DATA packet.
Server MUST wait for the **Data Empty Trigger** from the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2.1"></a>
##### 3.1.5.2.1 Data Empty Trigger

Server MUST ignore **Data Empty Trigger** when **SessionState** (section [3.1.1](#Section_3.2.1)) is not set to **DataState**.

Otherwise, server MUST change the **SessionState** (section 3.1.1) to **QueryState** and MUST continue processing as specified in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1).

<a id="Section_3.1.5.3"></a>
#### 3.1.5.3 Status Trigger

**Status Trigger** MUST provide the payload received from client. Server MUST validate that the payload specifies a PROGRESS packet (section [2.2.5](#Section_2.2.5)).

<a id="Section_3.1.5.4"></a>
#### 3.1.5.4 Terminate Trigger

When Terminate Trigger is received, server MUST shut down the WDS Multicast Application Protocol.

<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>
### 3.1.6 Timer Events

<a id="Section_3.1.6.1"></a>
#### 3.1.6.1 Query Timer

If the **ClientCNTCIRPackets** (section [3.1.1](#Section_3.2.1)) is empty, the server MUST continue processing as specified in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1).

If the **ClientCNTCIRPackets** is not empty, the server MUST remove all entries stored in **MissingBlockRanges** (section 3.1.1). The server MUST merge block ranges specified by CNTCIR packets stored in **ClientCNTCIRPacket** and store the merged block ranges list into **MissingBlockRanges**.

To merge the block ranges, the server MUST first eliminate the CNTCIR packet (section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3)) as follows:

- Find the CNTCIR packet which has the highest value for the **TimeInSession** field (section 2.2.3).
- Delete all such CNTCIR packets in the **ClientCNTCIRPackets** (section where the **TimeInSession** field specifies that the client joined after 30 seconds of the oldest client.
Server MUST construct a merged list of missing block ranges from the remaining CNTCIR packets in **ClientCNTCIRPackets** and set the **MissingBlockRanges** to the merged list.

The merged list MUST NOT have any overlapping block ranges and MUST be in ascending order.

Server MUST change the **SessionState** (section 3.1.1) to **DataState** and MUST disable **Query Timer** and continue processing as specified in section [3.1.5.2](#Section_1.3).

### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

**TotalBlocks:** Specifies the number of blocks in the content. This value is provided by the WDS Multicast Session Initiation Protocol [MS-WDSMSI](../MS-WDSMSI/MS-WDSMSI.md).

**MissingBlocksBitmap:** An array of bits where the size of the array is set to the value of **TotalBlocks**. Each bit in the array is initialized to 0. When a DATA packet (section [2.2.4](#Section_2.2.4)) is received for a specified [**block number**](#gt_block-number), the bit at that index is changed to 1. The array uses a 1-based index.

**BlockSize:** Specifies the number of bytes of content data sent in each DATA packet. This value is provided by the WDS Multicast Session Initiation Protocol.

**MaxCacheSize:** Specifies the maximum number of bytes of DATA packets that can be processed by a client before the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol [MS-WDSMT](#Section_2.1) stops sending the **DATA** trigger, and the protocol MUST wait for a **Cache Done** trigger from the WDS Multicast Application Protocol. The default maximum number of bytes is 2097152.

**JoinTime:** MUST be set to local time (in seconds) on initialization.

<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>

On initialization client MUST wait for packets to arrive from the server using the Lower-Layered Triggered Events as specified in section [3.2.5](#Section_3.2.5).

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The client processes the Lower-Layered Triggered Events from the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol, as specified in the following sections.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1"></a>
#### 3.2.5.1 DATA Trigger

The client MUST validate that the payload provided by the DATA Trigger specifies the DATA packet as per section [2.2.4](#Section_2.2.4). The client MUST check the value of the bit at the index specified by the **BlockNumber** field of the DATA packet in **MissingBlocksBitmap** (section [3.2.1](#Section_3.2.1)). If the value is set to one, then the client MUST ignore the DATA packet and stop further processing.

If the bit value is not set to one, the client MUST set the bit to one and MUST send the **Cache Done Trigger** to the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol [MS-WDSMT](#Section_2.1) specifying the size of the DATA packet.

The client MUST check whether all bits of **MissingBlocksBitmap** (section 3.2.1) are now set to one. If so then the download of Content has completed and the client MUST terminate.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2"></a>
#### 3.2.5.2 Query Cache Trigger

The client MUST reply to the trigger by providing the **MaxCacheSize** value (section [3.2.1](#Section_3.2.1)).

The client MUST provide the constructed packet in reply to the **QCC Trigger**.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.4"></a>
#### 3.2.5.4 POLL Trigger

When a POLL Trigger is received, the client MUST construct a CNTCIR packet (section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3)) and set the fields of the packet as follows:

**TimeInSession**: MUST be set to (Local Time in Seconds – **JoinTime** (section [3.2.1](#Section_3.2.1)) ).

**Progress**: MUST be set to the percentage of bits that are set to zero in **MissingBlocksBitmap** (section 3.2.1) and MUST be in range 0-100.

**RangeList**: The server MUST go through the **MissingBlocksBitmap** (section 3.2.1) to find the ranges of blocks that are missing (such blocks will have the respective bit set to zero) and MUST add all such missing ranges to the **RangeList** field. The number of ranges added MUST NOT exceed the limit specified in section [2.2.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.1).

**RangeCount**: MUST be set to the ranges specified by the **RangeList**.
