# 1 Introduction

The VT-UTF8 and VT100+ Protocols are used for point-to-point serial communication for [**terminal**](#gt_terminal) control and headless server configuration.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_american-national-standards-institute-ansi-character-set"></a>
**American National Standards Institute (ANSI) character set**: A character set defined by a code page approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The term "ANSI" as used to signify Windows code pages is a historical reference and a misnomer that persists in the Windows community. The source of this misnomer stems from the fact that the Windows code page 1252 was originally based on an ANSI draft, which became International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 8859-1 [[ISO/IEC-8859-1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90689). In Windows, the ANSI character set can be any of the following code pages: 1252, 1250, 1251, 1253, 1254, 1255, 1256, 1257, 1258, 874, 932, 936, 949, or 950. For example, "ANSI application" is usually a reference to a non-[**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) or code-page-based application. Therefore, "ANSI character set" is often misused to refer to one of the character sets defined by a Windows code page that can be used as an active system code page; for example, character sets defined by code page 1252 or character sets defined by code page 950. Windows is now based on [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode), so the use of ANSI character sets is strongly discouraged unless they are used to interoperate with legacy applications or legacy data.

<a id="gt_ascii"></a>
**ASCII**: The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is an 8-bit character-encoding scheme based on the English alphabet. ASCII codes represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other devices that work with text. ASCII refers to a single 8-bit ASCII character or an array of 8-bit ASCII characters with the high bit of each character set to zero.

<a id="gt_console-host"></a>
**console host**: A server process that sends and receives data from a hosted text-based/character-mode application client.

<a id="gt_management-console"></a>
**management console**: A remote computer that is used to interact with a local computer via a [**terminal emulator**](#gt_terminal-emulator). A [**management console**](#gt_management-console) is often in a geographically different location than the local computer. A single [**management console**](#gt_management-console) can be used to interact with one or more local computers.

<a id="gt_terminal"></a>
**terminal**: A text-based console. [**Terminals**](#gt_terminal) can be local or remote. A local [**terminal**](#gt_terminal) on a PC is typically an 80 × 25 text-format cell-based output that is displayed on a monitor.

<a id="gt_terminal-emulator"></a>
**terminal emulator**: Software that runs a remote [**terminal**](#gt_terminal) on a [**management console**](#gt_management-console). The [**terminal emulator**](#gt_terminal-emulator) uses a specified terminal type that must be agreed upon in advance via the local console and the remote [**terminal**](#gt_terminal).

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world. The [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) standard [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16 BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

<a id="gt_uninterruptible-power-supply-ups"></a>
**uninterruptible power supply (UPS)**: A device that provides a backup short-term power source for occasions when utility power is lost. A [**UPS**](#gt_uninterruptible-power-supply-ups) can be an intelligent device with which [**management consoles**](#gt_management-console) interact.

<a id="gt_utf-8"></a>
**UTF-8**: A byte-oriented standard for encoding Unicode characters, defined in the Unicode standard. Unless specified otherwise, this term refers to the UTF-8 encoding form specified in [UNICODE5.0.0/2007] section 3.9.

<a id="gt_vt100"></a>
**VT100**: A terminal type, as defined by [[VT100]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90560). [VT100] provides the definition for an English language, 80 × 25 text console.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

The VT-UTF8 and VT100+ protocols are used for point-to-point serial client/server communication.

Typically, the client is a [**terminal emulator**](#gt_terminal-emulator) and acts as a [**management console**](#gt_management-console); the server is a platform component that can be a basic input/output (BIOS), [**uninterruptible power supply (UPS)**](#gt_uninterruptible-power-supply-ups) processor, service processor, or software driver. For example, the protocols allow server power management to be invoked from a serial console.

Alternatively, the server is a terminal emulator and acts as a [**console host**](#gt_console-host) for an application client. The application can be running locally on the same machine as the emulator or remotely over any form of network connection. The client application emits a sequence of characters that are transported to the terminal emulator server and presented to the user on the screen. The VT100+ protocol allows graphical signaling information to be interleaved with character data within the sequence of characters as it travels between the client and server.

<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 VT-UTF8

The VT-UTF8 protocol uses [**UTF-8**](#gt_utf-8) encoding to allow [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) characters to be used without conflicting with the original [**VT100**](#gt_vt100) protocol commands. Using Unicode characters, for example, allows non-English output on a client display.

<a id="Section_1.3.2"></a>
### 1.3.2 VT100+

The VT100+ protocol extends the original [**VT100**](#gt_vt100) [**terminal**](#gt_terminal) specification ([[VT100]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90560)) to support the use of color in a client display terminal, to define character sequences for function keys on the U.S. standard keyboard (101 keys), and to make provisions for additional graphic characters.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol extends the [**VT100**](#gt_vt100) protocol, as specified in [[VT100]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90560).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

None.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The VT-UTF8 and VT100+ protocols can apply to text-mode serial connections to physical hardware devices in emergency scenarios such as power outages.

A text-mode serial connection can alternatively be the connection between a client application and a [**console host**](#gt_console-host) window process. In this case, "serial" refers to the practice of signaling messages on a single stream.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

None.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

None.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

The following sections specify how the VT-UTF8 and VT100+ protocols are transported and message syntax.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The VT-UTF8 and VT100+ protocols are transmitted over a serial port (COM port) connection.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 VT-UTF8 and VT100+ for Serial/UPS

The VT-UTF8 and VT100+ client console command request or server response consists of a single field that contains the "<ESC>" character followed by one or more characters. The entire sequence MUST be sent within 2 seconds of the initial <ESC>, as specified in sections [3.2.2](#Section_3.1.2) and [3.2.6](#Section_3.2.6).

**Command_Sequence**: The character sequence containing the entire client request.

| Character sequence | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <ESC>R<ESC>r<ESC>R | Reset. If the server is a BIOS with control of the serial port and reset is supported, the system MUST be reset within 5 seconds. If the server is a [**UPS**](#gt_uninterruptible-power-supply-ups), an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a service processor, or a software driver, and has control of the serial port, the server MUST be reset within 1 second. |
| <ESC>( | Invoke the server ASIC or service processor. After detecting this command sequence, the server ASIC or service processor MUST take control of the server serial port for console input/output (I/O). The server ASIC or service processor MUST return an Acknowledge Sequence within 1 second. |
| <ESC>) | Invoke the UPS processor. After detecting this command sequence, the server UPS processor MUST take control of the server serial port for console I/O. The server UPS processor MUST return an Acknowledge Sequence within 1 second. |
| <ESC>* | Acknowledge sequence. This response MUST be returned by the server UPS, ASIC, or service processor before any other server response, and within 1 second after it is invoked. |
| <ESC>Q | Exit without displaying the user interface. The server UPS, ASIC, or service processor MUST immediately release control of the server serial port, without interaction with the client. |
| <ESC>^ | Wake up. This requests that the server ASIC or service processor turn on the server within 1 second or wake the server from sleep state S1–S4 (for more information on sleep states, see [[ACPI]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=110519)). If the server is already turned on, server operation MUST NOT be disturbed. The server ASIC or service processor MUST return an Acknowledge Sequence within 1 second. |

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 VT100+ Character Extensions for Serial/UPS

The VT100+ character extensions conform to ANSI conventions for setting client display foreground and background colors. The [**VT100**](#gt_vt100) standard, approved by the American National Standards Institute, defines meanings to coded sequences of characters passed from computer to terminal, as specified in [[VT100]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90560). The VT100+ extensions use the same general format of coded sequences of characters, but assign additional meanings for sequences that were not defined in the VT100 standard. The VT100+ character and key extensions also support selected keyboard keys and graphics characters that are not part of the original VT100 [**terminal**](#gt_terminal) specification. Function keys on a U.S. standard keyboard (101 keys) are not equivalent to similarly named keys on a VT100 terminal keyboard.

# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Server Details

This section applies to both the [**console host**](#gt_console-host) server and [**uninterruptible power supply (UPS)**](#gt_uninterruptible-power-supply-ups) server implementations.<2>

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

When the [**uninterruptible power supply (UPS)**](#gt_uninterruptible-power-supply-ups) server receives an escape character, it MUST enter an escape state for 2 seconds as it waits for additional characters.

When the [**console host**](#gt_console-host) server receives an escape character, it MUST wait indefinitely for additional characters.

For more information, see section [3.1.2](#Section_3.1.2).

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

When an escape sequence is signaled to an [**uninterruptible power supply (UPS)**](#gt_uninterruptible-power-supply-ups) server, the server MUST receive the escaped characters within 2 seconds. For example, the sequence "<ESC>(" invokes the service processor. The "(" character MUST be received by the server within 2 seconds of when "<ESC>" is received.

When an escape sequence is signaled to a [**console host**](#gt_console-host) server, the server MUST wait indefinitely for the next character before invoking the service processor.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The [**uninterruptible power supply (UPS)**](#gt_uninterruptible-power-supply-ups) server requires no initialization.

The [**console host**](#gt_console-host) server requires initialization by the client application or by the user. Client applications can initialize the server through the SetConsoleMode function (see [[MSDN-ConsoleRef]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=626621)). Users or system administrators can set initialization to occur by default by setting the registry key at HKCU\VirtualTerminalLevel for each user account to a nonzero value.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

The server has no higher-layer triggered events.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The following sections specify the behavior of this protocol when receiving correct requests. Incorrect requests MUST be ignored.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>
#### 3.1.5.1 Sending VT-UTF8 and VT100+ Requests

The original [**VT100**](#gt_vt100) protocol, as specified in [[VT100]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90560), uses the [**ASCII**](#gt_ascii) character set. The [**UTF-8**](#gt_utf-8) algorithm MUST map a [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) character into a string of 8-bit bytes. The number of 8-bit bytes depends on the bit width of the Unicode character, as shown in the following table.

| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 - 7 | 0xxxxxxx | - |
| 8 - 11 | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx | - |
| 12 - 16 | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx | - |

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2"></a>
#### 3.1.5.2 Receiving VT-UTF8 and VT100+ Requests

When a series of bytes is received by the server, it MUST be decoded into the appropriate 16-bit [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) character. The leading byte MAY be 0x00000000.<3>

The decoded 16-bit Unicode character is then presented in the server representation, as specified in [[VT100]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90560) table A-11.

If an escape sequence is received, the server processes all the characters in the escape sequence as a single action that is described by the escape sequence, instead of processing each literal character in the sequence.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.3"></a>
#### 3.1.5.3 Receiving Character and Key Extensions

When a series of bytes is received by the server, it MUST be decoded into the appropriate 16-bit [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) character. The leading byte MAY be 0x00000000.

The decoded 16-bit Unicode character is then presented in the server representation according to the tables in [[VT100]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90560) table A-11.

If an escape sequence is received, the server processes all the characters in the escape sequence as a single action that is described by the escape sequence, instead of processing each literal character in the sequence.

<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>
### 3.1.6 Timer Events

If the server does not receive the escaped characters within 2 seconds of sequence initiation, the entire sequence is discarded.

<a id="Section_3.1.7"></a>
### 3.1.7 Other Local Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.2"></a>
## 3.2 Client Details

<a id="Section_3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

When the client receives an escape character, it MUST enter an escape state for 2 seconds as it waits for additional characters. For more information, see section [3.2.2](#Section_3.1.2).

<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

When an escape sequence is signaled, the client MUST receive the escaped characters within 2 seconds.

For example, the sequence "<ESC>(" invokes the service processor. The "(" character MUST be received by the server within 2 seconds of when "<ESC>" is received.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

The client requires no initialization.

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

The client has no higher-layer triggered events.

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The following sections specify this protocol's behavior when receiving correct requests. Incorrect requests MUST be ignored.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1"></a>
#### 3.2.5.1 Sending VT-UTF8 and VT100+ Requests

The original [**VT100**](#gt_vt100) protocol, as specified in [[VT100]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90560), uses the [**ASCII**](#gt_ascii) character set. The [**UTF-8**](#gt_utf-8) algorithm MUST map a [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) character into a string of 8-bit bytes. The number of 8-bit bytes depends on the bit width of the Unicode character, as shown in the following table.

| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-7 | 0xxxxxxx | - |
| 8-11 | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx | - |
| 12-16 | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx | - |

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2"></a>
#### 3.2.5.2 Receiving VT-UTF8 and VT100+ Requests

When a series of bytes is received by the client, it MUST be decoded into the appropriate 16-bit [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) character. The leading byte MAY be 0x00000000.

The decoded 16-bit Unicode character is then presented in the client representation according to the tables as specified in [[VT100]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90560) table A-11.

If an escape sequence is received, the client processes all the characters in the escape sequence as a single action that is described by the escape sequence, instead of processing each literal character in the sequence.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.3"></a>
#### 3.2.5.3 Receiving Client Display Terminal Color Extensions

When a series of bytes is received by the client, it MUST be decoded into the appropriate 16-bit [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) character.

The leading byte MAY be 0x00000000. The decoded 16-bit Unicode character is then presented in the client representation according to the tables as specified in [[VT100]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90560) table A-11.

If an escape sequence is received, the client processes all the characters in the escape sequence as a single action that is described by the escape sequence, instead of processing each literal character in the sequence.

# 4 Protocol Examples

<a id="Section_4.1"></a>
## 4.1 VT-UTF8 Example for Serial/UPS

A server wants to transmit the [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) character stream that is represented by the following code point sequence.

<004D, 0430, 4E8C>

The VT-UTF8 encoding of the Unicode character stream would be

<4D D0 B0 E4 BA 8C>

where

- <4D> corresponds to 0x004D
- <D0 B0> corresponds to 0x0430
- <E4 BA 8C> corresponds to 0x4E8C
This stream can be transmitted to the client and then decoded by reconstructing the same Unicode character stream.

<a id="Section_4.2"></a>
## 4.2 VT100+ Example for Serial/UPS

A user wishes to set the video mode to bold, the text foreground to black, and the background to green. The user sends the sequence

<ESC>[1,30,42m

as specified in section [2.2.2.1.1](#Section_2.2.2.1.1).

<a id="Section_4.3"></a>
## 4.3 VT100+ Example for Console Host

The following sequence patterns can be found in section [2.2.3.1.1](#Section_2.2.3.1.1).

A user wishes to reset all color/font information in an area of text back to what it originally was when the session started. The user sends the sequence:

`<ESC>[m`

A user wishes to set a bright/bold green foreground color with a dark blue background color. The user has two options and sends either of the following sequences:

`<ESC>[32;1;44m -OR- <ESC>[92;44m`

Each item of the sequence will be applied in the order it is received. 32 will set the dark green foreground, 1 will turn it into a bright/bold foreground color, then 44 will set the dark blue background. Or 92 will set a bright green foreground in one step.

A user can specify multiple overlapping colors and they will be applied from beginning to end in the order received. The final applicable color in the sequence will be the resulting video mode. In the following example, a user sets blue foreground then magenta foreground:

<ESC>32;35m

The final result will be a magenta foreground mode.
