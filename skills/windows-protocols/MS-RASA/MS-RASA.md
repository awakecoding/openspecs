# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Remote Access Server Advertisement (RASADV) Protocol, by which [**Remote Access Service (RAS) servers**](#gt_remote-access-service-ras-server) advertise their presence within a local network, which allows network administrators to detect nonmalicious configuration and deployment of gateways providing external access to their network.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_ascii"></a>
**ASCII**: The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is an 8-bit character-encoding scheme based on the English alphabet. ASCII codes represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other devices that work with text. ASCII refers to a single 8-bit ASCII character or an array of 8-bit ASCII characters with the high bit of each character set to zero.

<a id="gt_domain"></a>
**domain**: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a domain controller (DC) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting the Active Directory service. The domain controller provides authentication of members, creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD](../MS-AUTHSOD/MS-AUTHSOD.md) section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

<a id="gt_domain-name"></a>
**domain name**: The name given by an administrator to a collection of networked computers that share a common directory. Part of the domain naming service naming structure, domain names consist of a sequence of name labels separated by periods.

<a id="gt_remote-access-service-ras-server"></a>
**Remote Access Service (RAS) server**: A type of network access server (NAS) that provides modem dial-up or virtual private network (VPN) access to a network.

<a id="gt_user-datagram-protocol-udp"></a>
**User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: The connectionless protocol within TCP/IP that corresponds to the transport layer in the ISO/OSI reference model.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.2"></a>

<a id="Section_1.2.2"></a>
### 1.2.2 Informative References

None.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

The RASADV Protocol is a simple, unidirectional, multicast protocol. The sender is a [**RAS server**](#gt_f8c23490-c220-4d75-a9bd-db04e8fc1c48), which puts its machine name in a message and periodically multicasts it on its local network.<1> The receiver listens for periodic messages and passes the message content (the sender's machine name) and the source address to an application.<2> A typical application using the listener side of this protocol displays the information to the user.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The RASADV Protocol depends on the [**User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**](#gt_user-datagram-protocol-udp), as specified in [[RFC768]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90490), as a transport. No other protocols depend on the RASADV Protocol.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The RASADV Protocol applies only to detecting intentional or accidental configuration and deployment of servers over time. It does not apply to detecting malicious configuration and deployment. It also does not apply if an administrator requires the ability to quickly detect such servers on demand, because it relies on a periodic broadcast mechanism.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

The RASADV Protocol has no versioning or capability negotiation capabilities.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol has no vendor-extensible fields.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

The RASADV Protocol uses the following standards assignments.

| Parameter | Value | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**UDP**](#gt_user-datagram-protocol-udp) port number | 9753 | [[IANAPORT]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89888) |
| Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) multicast address | 239.255.2.2 | [[IANAIMA]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90683) |

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

The following sections specify how RASADV Protocol messages are transported and common RASADV Protocol data types.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

All messages MUST be sent over [**UDP**](#gt_user-datagram-protocol-udp), as specified in [[RFC768]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90490), with the UDP destination port set to 9753 and the IP destination address set to 239.255.2.2. The IP Time to Live (TTL), as specified in [[RFC791]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=392659) section 3.1, SHOULD be set to 15.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

The RASADV Protocol has a single message type.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Server Advertisement

The [**UDP**](#gt_user-datagram-protocol-udp) message MUST be one of the following:

- The [**ASCII**](#gt_ascii) string "Hostname=<hostname>", where *<hostname>* is replaced with the host name of the sender, followed by a line feed (0x0A) and a null character (0x00). This syntax MUST be used if the sender is not a member of a [**domain**](#gt_domain).
- The ASCII string "Hostname=<hostname>\nDomain=<domainname>", where *<hostname>* is replaced with the host name of the sender, followed by a line feed (0x0A), and *<domainname>* is replaced with the [**domain name**](#gt_domain-name) of the domain of which the machine is a member, followed by a line feed (0x0A) and a null character (0x00). This syntax MUST be used if the sender is a member of a domain.

# 4 Protocol Examples

Following are two examples where a [**RAS server**](#gt_f8c23490-c220-4d75-a9bd-db04e8fc1c48) broadcasts its advertisement on the local network.

<a id="Section_4.1"></a>
## 4.1 Example 1

The network administrator starts a listener tool. The tool begins listening on the RASADV port and the multicast address. Later, the user configures a [**RAS server**](#gt_f8c23490-c220-4d75-a9bd-db04e8fc1c48) on the local network, on a computer named "myserver", which is not a member of a [**domain**](#gt_domain). When the RAS server starts, and every hour thereafter, it sends a [Server Advertisement](#Section_2.2.1) message containing the string "Hostname=myserver" followed by a line feed (0x0A) and a null character (0x00).

![image1](media/image1.png)

<a id="Section_4.2"></a>
## 4.2 Example 2

The network administrator starts a listener tool. The tool begins listening on the RASADV port and the multicast address. Later, the user configures a [**RAS server**](#gt_f8c23490-c220-4d75-a9bd-db04e8fc1c48) on the local network, on a computer named "myserver", which is a member of the [**domain**](#gt_domain) named "example.com". When the RAS server starts, and every hour thereafter, it sends a [Server Advertisement](#Section_2.2.1) message containing the string "Hostname=myserver.Domain=example.com" followed by a line feed (0x0A) and a null character (0x00).

<a id="Section_5"></a>
# 5 Security

The following sections specify security considerations for implementers of the RASADV Protocol.

<a id="Section_5.1"></a>
## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

RASADV assumes that servers advertise themselves in order to be detected, and therefore does not provide any security or the ability to detect malicious servers.

<a id="Section_5.2"></a>
## 5.2 Index of Security Parameters

This protocol has no security parameters.
