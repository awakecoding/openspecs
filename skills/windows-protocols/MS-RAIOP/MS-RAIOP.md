# 1 Introduction

This document describes the Remote Assistance Initiation over PNRP Protocol, which is used to establish a [**Remote Assistance connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) between two computers. This protocol uses the [**Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP)**](#gt_peer-name-resolution-protocol-pnrp), as specified in [MS-PNRP](#Section_2.2.2), to transfer the [Remote Assistance connection string (section 2.2.1)](#Section_2.2.1) securely between two computers. After the Remote Assistance connection string is transferred, a [**Remote Assistance session**](#gt_remote-assistance-session) can be established between the two computers.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

**Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**: A high-precision atomic time standard that approximately tracks Universal Time (UT). It is the basis for legal, civil time all over the Earth. Time zones around the world are expressed as positive and negative offsets from UTC. In this role, it is also referred to as Zulu time (Z) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). In these specifications, all references to UTC refer to the time at UTC-0 (or GMT).

<a id="gt_expert"></a>
**expert**: The side of a [**Remote Assistance connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) that is able to view the remote screen of the other computer in order to provide help.

A [**Remote Assistance contact**](#gt_remote-assistance-contact) is then created on the [**expert**](#gt_expert) and [**novice**](#gt_novice) computers. This allows [**Secure Peer Names**](#gt_secure-peer-name) to be used in subsequent sessions.

<a id="gt_remote-assistance-session"></a>
**Remote Assistance session**: A [**Remote Assistance connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) that has been accepted by the [**novice**](#gt_novice). The [**expert**](#gt_expert) is able to view the [**novice's**](#gt_novice) screen once the Remote Assistance session is started.

## 1.3 Overview

This protocol is used to transfer the [Remote Assistance Connection String (section 2.2.1)](#Section_2.2.1) from the [**novice**](#gt_novice) to the [**expert**](#gt_expert). After the connection string, as defined in [MS-RAI](../MS-RAI/MS-RAI.md) section 2.2.1, is transferred, a [**Remote Assistance session**](#gt_remote-assistance-session) can be established as specified in [MS-RA](../MS-RA/MS-RA.md).

The protocol describes two methods based on [**PNRP**](#gt_peer-name-resolution-protocol-pnrp) to exchange the Remote Assistance Connection String:

**Using an Unsecured Peer Name**: This method uses [**Unsecured Peer Names**](#gt_unsecured-peer-name) (as specified in [MS-PNRP](#Section_2.2.2)) to transfer the Remote Assistance Connection String. The connection string is encrypted and posted as an [**extended payload**](#gt_extended-payload) associated with the Unsecured Peer Name. When this method is used, the novice relays a password to the expert. Using the password provided by the novice, the expert locates the Unsecured Peer Name, downloads the payload, and decrypts the Remote Assistance Connection String. Using the connection string, the expert can make a [**Remote Assistance connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) to the novice.

**Using a Secure Peer Name**: This method uses [**Secure Peer Names**](#gt_secure-peer-name) (as specified in [MS-PNRP]) to transfer the Remote Assistance Connection String between the novice and the expert. The novice and the expert can have [**Remote Assistance contacts**](#gt_remote-assistance-contact) for each other. This method does not require a password. Using the Secure Peer Name, the expert can download the extended payload that contains the Remote Assistance Connection String. Using the connection string, the expert can make a Remote Assistance connection to the novice.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

[**RAIOP**](#gt_raiop) assumes that the Peer Name Resolution Protocol [MS-PNRP](#Section_2.2.2) is available to transport the [Remote Assistance Connection String](#Section_2.2.1). After the Remote Assistance Connection String is transferred, the [**expert**](#gt_expert) can connect to the [**novice**](#gt_novice) and initiate a [**Remote Assistance session**](#gt_remote-assistance-session) as specified in [MS-RA](../MS-RA/MS-RA.md). This protocol also uses [**Remote Assistance contacts**](#gt_remote-assistance-contact) as specified in [MS-RA].

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

This protocol assumes that both computers do not have a [**UTC**](#gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc) time offset that is greater than 1 hour.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol can only be used between two computers if the [**Global PNRP cloud**](#gt_global-pnrp-cloud) is visible to both the [**novice**](#gt_novice) and [**expert**](#gt_expert).

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This protocol does not provide for version or capability negotiation.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

There are no vendor-extensible fields in the Remote Assistance Initiation over PNRP Protocol.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

The Remote Assistance Initiation over PNRP Protocol does not use any standards assignments.

<a id="Section_3"></a>
# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Unsecured Peer Name - Publisher Details

The purpose of the [**Unsecured Peer Name**](#gt_unsecured-peer-name) Initiation is to allow a [Remote Assistance Connection String](#Section_2.2.1) (defined in [MS-RA](../MS-RA/MS-RA.md)) to be passed from the [**publisher**](#gt_publisher) of the string to the [**consumer**](#gt_consumer). After the string is passed, the consumer uses the string to initialize a [**Remote Assistance connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection) and to view and share the publisher’s screen. After the [**Remote Assistance session**](#gt_remote-assistance-session) is started, the [**Peer Name**](#gt_peer-name) SHOULD be unregistered by the publisher because it has no further purpose.

After the connection string is generated, the [**Global PNRP cloud**](#gt_global-pnrp-cloud) MUST be joined as specified in [MS-PNRP](#Section_2.2.2) section 1.3.3. After the cloud is discovered and joined, the publisher MUST register an Unsecured Peer Name and associate the encrypted connection string as a payload to the Peer Name.

The task of initiating a Remote Assistance connection is shown in the following diagram.

![Publishing connection information](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Publishing connection information

**Initial state**: The initial state where the publisher has the string that will enable a Remote Assistance connection to be established and wants to let the consumer know the contents of the string.

**Unsecured Peer Name registered**: An Unsecured Peer Name was registered with the encrypted connection string associated as a payload.

**Unsecured Peer Name unregistered**: A Remote Assistance session was initialized or the expiration timer event occurred and the payload in the Unsecured Peer Name is no longer useful. The Peer Name SHOULD be unregistered.

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with the behavior described in this document.

The [**publisher**](#gt_publisher) generates a password that is used to encrypt the payload containing a [Remote Assistance Connection String](#Section_2.2.1) and to create an [**Unsecured Peer Name**](#gt_unsecured-peer-name). The publisher registers the Unsecured Peer Name, associating the encrypted payload, which will be resolved later by the [**consumer**](#gt_consumer). The publisher conveys the password to the consumer through some external means.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

<a id="Section_3.1.2.1"></a>
#### 3.1.2.1 Expiration Timer

A 30-minute timer SHOULD be started after registration of the [**Unsecured Peer Name**](#gt_unsecured-peer-name), as specified in section [3.1.5.3](#Section_3.1.5.3).

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

To initialize this protocol, the following MUST be done:

- The [**Global PNRP cloud**](#gt_global-pnrp-cloud) MUST be discovered and joined as defined in [MS-PNRP](#Section_2.2.2) section 1.3.3.
- A connection string as defined in [MS-RAI](../MS-RAI/MS-RAI.md) section 2.2 MUST be created.
<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

After initialization, a password MUST be derived as defined in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1) and the connection string MUST be encrypted as defined in section [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2). Next, an [**Unsecured Peer Name**](#gt_unsecured-peer-name) MUST be registered with the encrypted connection string as the payload as defined in section [3.1.5.3](#Section_3.1.5.3).

After the [**Remote Assistance session**](#gt_remote-assistance-session) is established, the Unsecured Peer Name SHOULD be unregistered, as defined in [MS-PNRP](#Section_2.2.2) section 3.2.4.2.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>
#### 3.1.5.1 Deriving a Password

When a password is derived from the connection string, only certain characters from the English alphabet and digits are used. The string "BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ23456789", which is referred to as the Allowed Characters string, is used to define the only usable characters for deriving a password. The derived password MUST be 6 characters in length.

The password that is used, both to encrypt the connection string and as the basis for generating a [**Peer Name**](#gt_peer-name), MUST be created by using the following algorithm:

- Copy the Unicode connection string, not including any terminating NULL character, into a byte buffer that is referred to as hash input. If the connection string is longer than 8,000 bytes, copy only the first 8,000 bytes into the buffer. The hash input size is always the buffer size of the Unicode connection string (or 8,000 bytes, whichever is smaller), plus 20 additional bytes that are used for the hash result in the following steps. For the initial hash input, the 20 bytes that are used in subsequent steps for the hash result MUST be set to zero.
- Use the [**SHA-1 hash**](#gt_sha-1-hash) algorithm, as specified in [[FIPS180-2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89868), to derive a value that is referred to as a hash result from the hash input.
- Concatenate the hash result to the original connection string and copy the result into the hash input.
- Repeat steps 2 and 3 for 99,999 times, for a total of 100,000 hash operations.
- For each of the first 6 bytes derived from the hash result that is obtained from the 100,000th iteration, convert the byte value into an index into the Allowed Characters string by using the following formula:
Index=FLOOR((Derived Byte/256.0)*Character Length of Allowed Characters)

The **FLOOR** function returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to the resultant floating-point value of the previous expression. The values for *Index*, *Derived Byte*, and *Character Length of Allowed Characters* MUST be integers.

- For each of these calculated indexes, convert the index into a letter or number by indexing into the Allowed Characters string.
- The password is a concatenation of these 6 letters.
<a id="Section_3.1.5.2"></a>
#### 3.1.5.2 Encrypting the Connection String

To encrypt the connection string, a password MUST be derived as defined in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1). To encrypt the connection string, the following algorithm MUST be followed:

- Get the number of hours that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 [**UTC**](#gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc) and convert the decimal value into a Unicode-formatted string. For example, 338,540 hours is represented by the [**Unicode string**](#gt_unicode-string) in the form "338540".
- Concatenate the derived password and the number of hours string. The resultant string MUST be a Unicode-formatted string, which is referred to as the original concatenated Unicode string in the following steps.
- Copy the original concatenated Unicode string into a byte buffer that is referred to as hash input. The hash input includes the byte buffer of the Unicode string that is obtained in step 2, plus 20 additional bytes of the hash result that is obtained in step 4 of the previous hash operation, if any. For the initial hash input, the last 20 bytes used for the hash result MUST be set to zero.
- Use the [**SHA-1 hash**](#gt_sha-1-hash) algorithm, as specified in [[FIPS180-2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89868), to derive a value that is referred to as a hash result from the hash input.
- Concatenate the hash result to the original concatenated Unicode string, and copy the result into a byte buffer that is referred to as the hash input.
- Repeat steps 4 and 5 for 99,999 times, for a total of 100,000 hash operations.
- Transform the first 16 bytes of the hash result into a [**HexConvertedUnicodeString**](#gt_hexconvertedunicodestring). This transformation uses each sequence of 4 bits as a zero-based index into the Unicode lookup string "0123456789ABCDEF" to obtain a matching Unicode character. The order of the data is not changed (that is, the most significant first 4 bits are used to obtain the first value, and least significant last 4 bits are used to obtain the second value). The transformation produces a 32-character Unicode string that is referred to as the key string. For example, the hash result {0x9A, 0xC1, 0x32, ..., 0xAB} would yield the HexConvertedUnicodeString "9AC132…AB" with the in-memory representation of {0x39, 0x00, 0x41, 0x00, 0x43, 0x00, 0x31, 0x00, 0x33, 0x00, 0x32, 0x00, … 0x41, 0x00, 0x42, 0x00}.
- Using the SHA-1 hash algorithm, hash the key string.
- Using the resultant hash, use the AES_128 algorithm, as specified in [[FIPS197]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89870), to derive a cipher key for encryption.
- Encrypt the Unicode connection string by using the cipher key from step 9 and the AES_128 algorithm.

#### 3.1.5.3 Creating the PNRP Node

To register an [**Unsecured Peer Name**](#gt_unsecured-peer-name), a password MUST be derived as defined in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1). Also, the connection string MUST be encrypted as defined in section [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2). To register an Unsecured Peer Name, the following algorithm MUST be followed:

- Get the number of hours that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 [**UTC**](#gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc) and convert the decimal value into a Unicode-formatted string. For example, 338,540 hours is represented by the [**Unicode string**](#gt_unicode-string) in the form "338540".
- Concatenate the derived password and the number of hours string. The resultant string MUST be a Unicode-formatted string, which is referred to as the original concatenated Unicode string in the following steps.
- Copy the original concatenated Unicode string into a byte buffer that is referred to as hash input. The hash input includes the byte buffer of the Unicode string that is obtained in step 2, plus 20 additional bytes of the hash result that is obtained in step 4 of the previous hash operation, if any. For the initial hash input, the last 20 bytes used for the hash result MUST be set to zero.
- Use the [**SHA-1 hash**](#gt_sha-1-hash) algorithm, as specified in [[FIPS180-2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89868), to derive a value that is referred to as a hash result from the hash input.
- Concatenate the hash result to the original concatenated Unicode string, and copy the result into a byte buffer that is referred to as the hash input.
- Repeat steps 4 and 5 for 99,999 times, for a total of 100,000 hash operations.
- Transform the first 16 bytes of the hash result into a [**HexConvertedUnicodeString**](#gt_hexconvertedunicodestring). This transformation uses each sequence of 4 bits as a zero-based index into the Unicode lookup string "0123456789ABCDEF" to obtain a matching Unicode character. The order of the data is not changed (that is, the most significant first 4 bits are used to obtain the first value, and least significant last 4 bits are used to obtain the second value). The transformation produces a 32-character Unicode string that is referred to as the key string. For example, the hash result {0x9A, 0xC1, 0x32, ..., 0xAB} would yield the HexConvertedUnicodeString "9AC132…AB" with the in-memory representation of {0x39, 0x00, 0x41, 0x00, 0x43, 0x00, 0x31, 0x00, 0x33, 0x00, 0x32, 0x00, … 0x41, 0x00, 0x42, 0x00}.
- Use the HexConvertedUnicodeString generated in step 7 to register an Unsecured Peer Name by using the HexConvertedUnicodeString as the classifier and an authority of "0". The encrypted connection string MUST be set as the payload. (See [MS-PNRP](#Section_2.2.2) for registering an Unsecured Peer Name.)

After a [**Peer Name**](#gt_peer-name) is derived, the application MUST then resolve the Peer Name and obtain the payload that is associated with it, as defined in section [3.2.5.2](#Section_3.2.5.2). When the payload is retrieved, it MUST be decrypted as defined in section [3.2.5.3](#Section_3.2.5.3).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1"></a>
#### 3.2.5.1 Deriving an Unsecured Peer Name from a Password

To derive an [**Unsecured Peer Name**](#gt_unsecured-peer-name) from a password:

- Get the number of hours that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 [**UTC**](#gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc) and convert the decimal value into a Unicode-formatted string. For example, 338,540 hours is represented by the [**Unicode string**](#gt_unicode-string) in the form "338540".
- Concatenate the password and the number of hours string. The resultant string MUST be a Unicode-formatted string, which is referred to as the original concatenated Unicode string in the following steps.
- Copy the original concatenated Unicode string into a byte buffer that is referred to as hash input. The hash input includes the byte buffer of the Unicode string that is obtained in step 2, plus 20 additional bytes of the hash result that is obtained in step 4 of the previous hash operation, if any. For the initial hash input, the last 20 bytes used for the hash result MUST be set to zero.
- Use the [**SHA-1 hash**](#gt_sha-1-hash) algorithm, as specified in [[FIPS180-2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89868), to derive a value that is referred to as a hash result from the hash input.
- Concatenate the hash result to the original concatenated Unicode string, and copy the result into a byte buffer that is referred to as the hash input.
- Repeat steps 4 and 5 for 99,999 times, for a total of 100,000 hash operations.
- Transform the first 16 bytes of the hash result into a [**HexConvertedUnicodeString**](#gt_hexconvertedunicodestring). This transformation uses each sequence of 4 bits as a zero-based index into the Unicode lookup string "0123456789ABCDEF" to obtain a matching Unicode character. The order of the data is not changed (that is, the most significant first 4 bits are used to obtain the first value, and least significant last 4 bits are used to obtain the second value). The transformation produces a 32-character Unicode string that is referred to as the key string. For example, the hash result {0x9A, 0xC1, 0x32, ..., 0xAB} would yield the HexConvertedUnicodeString "9AC132…AB" with the in-memory representation of {0x39, 0x00, 0x41, 0x00, 0x43, 0x00, 0x31, 0x00, 0x33, 0x00, 0x32, 0x00, … 0x41, 0x00, 0x42, 0x00}.

The derived [**Unsecured Peer Name**](#gt_unsecured-peer-name) (as defined in section [3.2.5.1](../MS-PNRP/MS-PNRP.md)) MUST be resolved as specified in [MS-PNRP](#Section_2.2.2) section 3.1.4.4. If the consumer fails to resolve the address, the consumer repeats the resolution up to two additional times until address resolution, each with a different initial value for the Unsecured Peer Name derivation as specified in section 3.2.5.1. For the first repetition, this value MUST be the number of hours elapsed since January 1, 1970, minus 1 hour. For the second repetition, this value MUST be the number of hours elapsed since January 1st, 1970, plus 1 hour. The payload associated with the Unsecured Peer Name is provided by the underlying Peer Name Resolution Protocol.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.3"></a>
#### 3.2.5.3 Decrypting the Payload

To decrypt the payload, the following steps MUST be taken:

- Using the [**SHA-1 hash**](#gt_sha-1-hash) algorithm, as specified in [[FIPS180-2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89868), hash the [**HexConvertedUnicodeString**](#gt_hexconvertedunicodestring) (as generated in step 7 of section [3.2.5.1](#Section_3.2.5.1)) to obtain a byte buffer.
- Using the resulting hash, use the AES_128 algorithm, as specified in [[FIPS197]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89870), to derive a cipher key for decryption.
- Decrypt the payload (obtained in section [3.2.5.2](#Section_3.2.5.2)) by using the cipher key from step 2 and the AES_128 algorithm to obtain the Unicode [Remote Assistance Connection String](#Section_2.2.1).

## 3.3 Secure Peer Name Initiation - Publisher Details

The purpose of the [**Secure Peer Name**](#gt_secure-peer-name) initiation is to allow a [Remote Assistance Connection String](#Section_2.2.1), as defined in [MS-RA](../MS-RA/MS-RA.md), to pass from the [**publisher**](#gt_publisher) of the string to the [**consumer**](#gt_consumer). After the string is passed, the consumer can use the string to initialize a [**Remote Assistance connection**](#gt_remote-assistance-connection), and to view and share the publisher's screen.

The task of initiating a Remote Assistance connection is shown in the following diagram.

![Publishing connection information](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: Publishing connection information

**Initial state**: This state is the initial state where the publisher has the string that will enable a Remote Assistance connection to be established and wants to let the consumer know the contents of the string.

**Secure Peer Name registered**: A Secure Peer Name has been registered with the encrypted connection string associated as a payload.

**Secure Peer Name unregistered**: After a [**Remote Assistance session**](#gt_remote-assistance-session) has been initialized or the expiration time event occurred, the payload in the Secure Peer Name is no longer useful. The Secure Peer Name SHOULD be unregistered.

<a id="Section_3.3.1"></a>
### 3.3.1 Abstract Data Model

### 3.3.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

To publish the connection string by using [**Secure Peer Name**](#gt_secure-peer-name) initiation, the connection string MUST first be encrypted as defined in section [3.3.5.1](#Section_3.3.5.1). Next, a Secure Peer Name MUST be created as specified in section [3.3.5.2](#Section_3.3.5.2).

The [MS-RA](../MS-RA/MS-RA.md) protocol defines a Remote Assistance Contact Information message that is used after a Remote Assistance connection is made using an Unsecured Peer Name. The Remote Assistance Contact Information message allows the publisher and consumer to exchange [**public keys**](#gt_public-key) and Secure Peer Names that match these public keys.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1"></a>
#### 3.3.5.1 Generating the Required PNRP Data

To generate the encrypted connection string payload, the following algorithm MUST be followed:

- Generate a pseudo-random 256-bit cipher key to use with the AES_256 encryption algorithm, as specified in [[FIPS197]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89870).
- Encrypt the Unicode connection string by using the AES_256 encryption algorithm, as specified in [FIPS197], and the cipher key that was generated in step 1, to produce the encrypted Connection Data.
- The publisher MUST obtain a [**public key**](#gt_public-key) that matches a private key that the consumer will use. Encrypt the cipher key that was generated in step 1 using the public key of the consumer and the [**Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)**](#gt_rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa) algorithm.
- Transform the encrypted cipher key generated in step 3 to a [**base64**](#gt_179b9392-9019-45a3-880b-26f6890522b7)-encoded Unicode string as specified in [[RFC4648]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90487), and call it the exported AES key. The byte length of the exported AES key MUST be used when the peer name is registered as specified in section [3.3.5.2](#Section_3.3.5.2).
- The encrypted connection string payload is obtained by appending the encrypted Connection Data from step 2 to the end of the exported AES key from step 4.
<a id="Section_3.3.5.2"></a>
#### 3.3.5.2 Registering a Secure Peer Name

To register a [**Secure Peer Name**](#gt_secure-peer-name), a [**public key**](#gt_public-key) from the public-private key pair that is known to the consumer MUST be used as an authority and the [**Unicode string**](#gt_unicode-string) "RAContact" MUST be used as a Peer identity to create a Secure Peer Name. The encrypted connection string payload that is generated in section [3.3.5.1](../MS-PNRP/MS-PNRP.md) MUST be used as the extended payload when this [**Peer Name**](#gt_peer-name) is registered. [**PNRP**](#gt_peer-name-resolution-protocol-pnrp) covers registering a Peer Name and designating a payload to associate with the Peer Name. The **FriendlyName** (as specified in [MS-PNRP](#Section_2.2.2), section 3.2.4.1) string of the Peer Name MUST be set to the byte length of the portion of the payload that is the exported AES key defined in section 3.3.5.1. The byte length is expressed as a Unicode string containing the decimal equivalent of the value of the byte length. For example, if the value of the byte length is 324, the comment section would contain the Unicode string "324".

## 4.1 Deriving a Password and Encrypting a Connection String for Unsecured Peer Name Initiation

This example follows the steps that appear in sections [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1) and [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2), which show how to derive a password and encrypt a sample string:

- Assume for the connection string "SAMPLE", when encryption is done, 1218745079 seconds have elapsed since January 1, 1970 [**UTC**](#gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc).
- The first hash input is the following, expressed in hexadecimal values.
53 00 41 00 4d 00 50 00 4c 00 45 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

- After the first hash iteration, the hash result is the following, expressed in hexadecimal values.
00 df 01 a1 9d 25 89 60 e6 a4 4a a9 8b e9 c2 6f 00 29 22 39

- When the hash result is added back to the original input, a new hash input results, which is expressed here in hexadecimal values.
53 00 41 00 4d 00 50 00 4c 00 45 00 00 df 01 a1 9d 25 89 60

e6 a4 4a a9 8b e9 c2 6f 00 29 22 39

- After the 100,000 iterations, the first sequence of 6 bytes of the hash result is the following, expressed in hexadecimal values.
1d f6 35 43 74 92

- Each byte is divided by 256 and then multiplied by 29 (the number of characters in the string). The resulting fractions are discarded to obtain an index for each byte. The resulting index for each byte is looked up in the password character string "BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ23456789" to obtain the corresponding character for that byte.
First value: 0x1d is 29, (29/256) * 29 =3.29 -> 3

Indexes: 3 27 6 7 13 16

Resultant characters: F 8 J K R V

- When the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970 is divided by 3600, the resulting figure is the number of hours that have elapsed since Jan 1, 1970 UTC. This number is concatenated to the derived characters to get the string "F8JKRV338540".
- The first hash input is the previous string copied into a byte buffer that is expressed in hexadecimal values.
46 00 38 00 4a 00 4b 00 52 00 56 00 33 00 33 00 38 00 35 00

34 00 30 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

00 00 00 00

- The first hash result is the following value, expressed in hexadecimal.
5f 3d 53 db 86 9a f1 ac 24 63 21 f4 c1 78 90 6d 91 a7 1a d5

- The hash result is then copied into the byte buffer and expressed in the following hexadecimal values.
46 00 38 00 4a 00 4b 00 52 00 56 00 33 00 33 00 38 00 35 00

34 00 30 00 5f 3d 53 db 86 9a f1 ac 24 63 21 f4 c1 78 90 6d

91 a7 1a d5

- The first 16 bytes of the final hash value, which occurs after 100,000 iterations, is expressed as the following hexadecimal values.
30 e3 db fb 31 4b 40 9a 70 bc ce 74 4c ad e6 5f

- The previous value is then converted into a [**Unicode string**](#gt_unicode-string) and results in "30E3DBFB314B409A70BCCE744CADE65F".
- Using the [**SHA-1 hash**](#gt_sha-1-hash) algorithm, hash the key string from step 12 to obtain the following hexadecimal values.
bb 50 02 ab ff f3 f8 23 6d 84 7d 50 ee a9 9a ba 2b 2c 1e 45

- XOR each byte from the result of step 13 with the constant 0x36 into a new buffer.
- Hash the resulting buffer using the SHA-1 algorithm.
- Use the first 16 bytes of the hash value as the derived cypher key for encryption using the AES 128 algorithm, as described in [[FIPS197]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89870).
- Encrypting the original connection string "SAMPLE" with the cipher key results in the following encrypted value.

## 4.2 Creating an Unsecured Peer Name from a Password

This example follows the steps that appear in sections [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1), [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2), and [3.1.5.3](#Section_3.1.5.3), which show how to derive a password from an [**Unsecured Peer Name**](#gt_unsecured-peer-name), encrypt the connection string, and then register the Unsecured Peer Name.

- Assume a password of "XVY3PH" is used. Also assume that when conversion is performed, 1218665203 seconds have elapsed since January 1, 1970 [**UTC**](#gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc).
- Divide the seconds count by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour), and for the figure 338518, drop any fraction.
- Concatenate to form the base [**Peer Name**](#gt_peer-name), which is the Unicode-formatted string "XVY3PH338518".
- Copy this string into a byte array that is large enough to hold both the base Peer Name and the hash output. The first hash input looks like the following example (20 bytes per line, expressed in hexadecimal values).
58 00 56 00 59 00 33 00 50 00 48 00 33 00 33 00 38 00 35 00

31 00 38 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

00 00 00 00

- Use the [**SHA-1 hash**](#gt_sha-1-hash) algorithm to convert this value, expressed in hexadecimal values.
3c 51 c6 24 a0 02 95 33 28 44 cc e9 7b 3e 18 9f 08 1e 96 2a

- Concatenate this hash result to the end of the base string to form a new hash input, expressed in hexadecimal values.
58 00 56 00 59 00 33 00 50 00 48 00 33 00 33 00 38 00 35 00

31 00 38 00 3c 51 c6 24 a0 02 95 33 28 44 cc e9 7b 3e 18 9f

08 1e 96 2a

- After repeating these steps 100,000 times, the last hash result is expressed in the following hexadecimal values.
41 05 04 d4 1b 2c d6 3c 31 d0 c1 53 9a d9 33 1c

- Converting the hash result to a [**Unicode string**](#gt_unicode-string) yields the following value.
410504D41B2CD63C31D0C1539AD9331C

- The resulting Unsecured Peer Name has no authority and is represented by "0." followed by a classifier. The final Peer Name is "0.410504D41B2CD63C31D0C1539AD9331C".
