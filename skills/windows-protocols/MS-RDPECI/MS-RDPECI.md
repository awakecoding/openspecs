## 1.3 Overview

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Core Input Virtual Channel Extension is used to remote keyboard and mouse input from a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) client to a terminal server and replaces the Slow-Path and Fast-Path Input Event PDUs specified in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md) sections 2.2.8.1.1.3.1.1 and 2.2.8.1.2.

Keyboard and mouse input is generated at the client by a physical or virtual keyboard or mouse, encoded, and then sent on the wire to the server. After this input is received and decoded by the server, it is injected into the session associated with the remote user, effectively remoting the keyboard and mouse input generated at the client.

An example message flow encapsulating all of the input messages, described in section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3), and protocol phases is presented in the following figure.

![Messages exchanged by the core input protocol endpoints](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Messages exchanged by the core input protocol endpoints

The core input protocol is divided into two distinct phases:

- Initialization Phase
- Running Phase
The Initialization Phase occurs at the start of the connection. During this phase, the server and client exchange the supported protocol version using RDP_CORE_INPUT_CS_INIT_REQUEST_PDU (section [2.2.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.1)) and RDP_CORE_INPUT_SC_INIT_RESPONSE_PDU (section [2.2.3.2](#Section_2.2.3.2)) messages. The client initiates this exchange when the dynamic virtual channel (sections [1.4](#Section_1.4) and [2.1](#Section_2.1)) over which the core input messages will flow has been opened.

Once both endpoints are ready, the Running Phase is entered. During this phase, the client sends keyboard and mouse events to the server encapsulated in the RDP_CORE_INPUT_CS_KEYBOARD_AND_MOUSE_INPUT_PDU (section [2.2.3.3](#Section_2.2.3.3)) message. The server decodes these events and injects them into the user's session.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Core Input Virtual Channel Extension is embedded in a dynamic virtual channel transport, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) sections 1 to 3.

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Core Input Virtual Channel Extension replaces the TS_FP_INPUT_PDU specified in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md) section 2.2.8.1.2.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Core Input Virtual Channel Extension operates only after the dynamic virtual channel transport is fully established. If the dynamic virtual channel transport is terminated, the Remote Desktop Protocol: Core Input Virtual Channel Extension is also terminated. The protocol is terminated by closing the underlying virtual channel. For details about closing the dynamic virtual channel, see [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) section 3.2.5.2.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Core Input Virtual Channel Extension is applicable in scenarios where the transfer of keyboard and mouse events (generated by a physical or virtual keyboard and mouse) is required from a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) client to a terminal server.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

During the Initialization phase, the server and client exchange the supported protocol version using the RDP_CORE_INPUT_CS_INIT_REQUEST_PDU (section [2.2.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.1)) and RDP_CORE_INPUT_SC_INIT_RESPONSE_PDU (section [2.2.3.2](#Section_2.2.3.2)) messages. The client initiates this exchange when the dynamic virtual channel (sections [1.4](#Section_1.4) and [2.1](#Section_2.1)) over which the core input messages will flow has been opened.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

None.

# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Core Input Virtual Channel Extension is designed to operate over a dynamic virtual channel, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC] sections 1 to 3. The dynamic virtual channel name is the null-terminated ANSI character string "Microsoft::Windows::RDS::CoreInput". The usage of channel names in the context of opening a dynamic virtual channel is specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) section 2.2.2.1.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

The following sections specify the Remote Desktop Protocol: Core Input Virtual Channel Extension message syntax. All multiple-byte fields within a message MUST be marshaled in [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) byte order, unless otherwise specified.

| PTRFLAGS_WHEEL 0x0200 | The event is a vertical mouse wheel rotation. The only valid flags in a vertical wheel rotation event are PTRFLAGS_WHEEL_NEGATIVE and the WheelRotationMask; all other pointer flags are ignored. |
| PTRFLAGS_WHEEL_NEGATIVE 0x0100 | The wheel rotation value (contained in the WheelRotationMask bit field) is negative and MUST be sign-extended before injection at the server. |
| WheelRotationMask 0x01FF | The bit field that describes the number of rotation units the mouse wheel was rotated. The value is negative if the PTRFLAGS_WHEEL_NEGATIVE flag is set. |

If both PTRFLAGS_WHEEL (0x0200) and PTRFLAGS_HWHEEL (0x0400) are specified, then PTRFLAGS_WHEEL takes precedence.

For a mouse movement event:

| **Flag** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- |
| PTRFLAGS_MOVE 0x0800 | Indicates that the mouse position MUST be updated to the location specified by the xPos and yPos fields. |

For a mouse button event:

| **Flag** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- |
| PTRFLAGS_DOWN 0x8000 | Indicates that a click event has occurred at the position specified by the xPos and yPos fields. The button flags indicate which button has been clicked, and at least one of these flags MUST be set. |
| PTRFLAGS_BUTTON1 0x1000 | Mouse button 1 (left button) was clicked or released. If the PTRFLAGS_DOWN flag is set, then the button was clicked, otherwise it was released. |
| PTRFLAGS_BUTTON2 0x2000 | Mouse button 2 (right button) was clicked or released. If the PTRFLAGS_DOWN flag is set, then the button was clicked, otherwise it was released. |
| PTRFLAGS_BUTTON3 0x4000 | Mouse button 3 (middle button or wheel) was clicked or released. If the PTRFLAGS_DOWN flag is set, then the button was clicked, otherwise it was released. |

For an extended mouse button event:

| **Flag** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- |
| PTRXFLAGS_DOWN 0x8000 | Indicates that a click event has occurred at the position specified by the xPos and yPos fields. The button flags indicate which button has been clicked, and at least one of these flags MUST be set. |
| PTRXFLAGS_BUTTON1 0x0001 | Extended mouse button 1 (also referred to as button 4) was clicked or released. If the PTRXFLAGS_DOWN flag is set, the button was clicked; otherwise, it was released. |
| PTRXFLAGS_BUTTON2 0x0002 | Extended mouse button 2 (also referred to as button 5) was clicked or released. If the PTRXFLAGS_DOWN flag is set, the button was clicked; otherwise, it was released. |

**xPos (2 bytes):** A 16-bit, unsigned integer that specifies the x-coordinate of the pointer relative to the top-left corner of the server's desktop. This field SHOULD be ignored by the server if the PTRFLAGS_WHEEL (0x0200) or PTRFLAGS_HWHEEL (0x0400) flag is specified in the **pointerFlags** field.

**yPos (2 bytes):** A 16-bit, unsigned integer that specifies the y-coordinate of the pointer relative to the top-left corner of the server's desktop. This field SHOULD be ignored by the server if the PTRFLAGS_WHEEL (0x0200) or PTRFLAGS_HWHEEL (0x0400) flag is specified in the **pointerFlags** field.

<a id="Section_2.2.2.6"></a>
#### 2.2.2.6 TS_QOE_INPUT_TIMESTAMP_EVENT

The TS_QOE_INPUT_TIMESTAMP_EVENT is used to enable the calculation of Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics. This event is sent solely for informational and debugging purposes and MUST NOT be transmitted to the server if the TS_INPUT_FLAG_QOE_TIMESTAMPS (0x0200) flag was not received in the Input Capability Set ([MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md) section 2.2.7.1.6).

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-31: "timestamp"
```

**timestamp (4 bytes):** A 32-bit, unsigned integer. A client-generated timestamp, in milliseconds, that indicates when the current input batch was encoded by the client. The value of the first timestamp sent by the client implicitly defines the origin for all subsequent timestamps. The server is responsible for handling roll-over of the timestamp.

<a id="Section_2.2.2.7"></a>
#### TS_RELPOINTER_EVENT

The TS_RELPOINTER_EVENT structure is used to specify relative mouse pointer movement (as opposed to absolute positioning).

```mermaid

| **Flag** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- |
| PTRFLAGS_DOWN 0x8000 | Indicates that a press event has occurred at the position that results from the application of the **xDelta** and **yDelta** fields to the previous position. The button flags indicate which button has been pressed and at least one of these flags MUST be set. |
| PTRFLAGS_BUTTON1 0x1000 | Mouse button 1 (left button) was clicked or released. If the PTRFLAGS_DOWN flag is set, then the button was clicked, otherwise it was released. |
| PTRFLAGS_BUTTON2 0x2000 | Mouse button 2 (right button) was clicked or released. If the PTRFLAGS_DOWN flag is set, then the button was clicked, otherwise it was released. |
| PTRFLAGS_BUTTON3 0x4000 | Mouse button 3 (middle button or wheel) was clicked or released. If the PTRFLAGS_DOWN flag is set, then the button was clicked, otherwise it was released. |

For an extended mouse button event:

| **Flag** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- |
| PTRXFLAGS_DOWN 0x8000 | Indicates that a press event has occurred at the position that results from the application of the **xDelta** and **yDelta** fields to the previous position. The button flags indicate which button has been pressed and at least one of these flags MUST be set. |
