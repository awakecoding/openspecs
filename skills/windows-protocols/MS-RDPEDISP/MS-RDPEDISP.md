# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Remote Desktop Protocol: Display Control Channel Extension to the Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting, as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md) sections 1 to 5. This control protocol is used by the client to request display configuration changes in a remote session. Display configuration changes include the addition, removal and repositioning of monitors, resolution updates, and orientation updates.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_ansi-character"></a>
**ANSI character**: An 8-bit Windows-1252 character set unit.

<a id="gt_desktop-scale-factor"></a>
**desktop scale factor**: The scale factor (as a percentage) applied to Windows Desktop Applications.

<a id="gt_device-scale-factor"></a>
**device scale factor**: The scale factor as a percentage is applied to Windows Store Apps. This value has to be calculated such that the effective maximum height of a Windows Store App is always greater than 768 pixels, otherwise the app will not start.

<a id="gt_dynamic-virtual-channel"></a>
**dynamic virtual channel**: A transport used for lossless communication between an RDP client and a server component over a main data connection, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC].

<a id="gt_virtual-channel"></a>
**virtual channel**: A communication channel available in a TS server session between applications running at the server and applications running on the TS client.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.2 References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not match.

## 1.3 Protocol Overview (Synopsis)

The sequence of messages exchanged by the Remote Desktop Protocol: Display Control Virtual Channel Extension is described in the following figure. The messages exchanged in this diagram are strictly sequential.

![The Display Control message sequence](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: The Display Control message sequence

After the Display Control [**dynamic virtual channel**](#gt_dynamic-virtual-channel) has been opened, the server communicates display capabilities to the client by sending the **DISPLAYCONTROL_CAPS_PDU** (section [2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.1)) message. This message specifies a set of parameters to which the client is required to adhere when sending the **DISPLAYCONTROL_MONITOR_LAYOUT_PDU** (section [2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2)) message.

To request a display configuration change on the server (such as the addition of a monitor or a new resolution for an existing monitor), the client sends the **DISPLAYCONTROL_MONITOR_LAYOUT_PDU** message to the server. If the requested configuration is not possible, or is invalid, the server will not update the remote session with the requested parameters.

Changes in the server-side display configuration occur out of band to the Remote Desktop Protocol: Display Control Virtual Channel Extension. If the requested graphics configuration is valid and can be configured on the server, then the server will either:

- Initiate a Deactivation-Reactivation Sequence (as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md) section 1.3.1.3) if the Remote Desktop Protocol: Graphics Pipeline Extension is not being used to remote session graphics.
- Restart the graphics pipeline using the surface management commands (specified in [MS-RDPEGFX](../MS-RDPEGFX/MS-RDPEGFX.md) section 1.3) if the Remote Desktop Protocol: Graphics Pipeline Extension is being used to remote session graphics.
The **DISPLAYCONTROL_MONITOR_LAYOUT_PDU** message can be sent whenever a display configuration change is required.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Display Control Virtual Channel Extension is embedded in a [**dynamic virtual channel**](#gt_dynamic-virtual-channel) transport, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) sections 1 to 3.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Display Control Virtual Channel Extension operates only after the [**dynamic virtual channel**](#gt_dynamic-virtual-channel) transport is fully established. If the dynamic virtual channel transport is terminated, the Remote Desktop Protocol: Display Control Virtual Channel Extension is also terminated. The protocol is terminated by closing the underlying [**virtual channel**](#gt_virtual-channel). For details about closing the dynamic virtual channel, refer to [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) section 3.2.5.2.

If the RemoteFX codec ([MS-RDPRFX](../MS-RDPRFX/MS-RDPRFX.md) sections 2.2.2 and 3.1.8) is being used to encode graphics data from a remote session, then the Remote Desktop Protocol: Display Control Virtual Channel Extension SHOULD NOT be used to request display configuration changes.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Display Control Virtual Channel Extension is applicable in scenarios where a mechanism to request display configuration changes in a remote session without disconnecting and reconnecting is required.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

None.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

None.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Display Control Virtual Channel Extension is designed to operate over a dynamic virtual channel, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) sections 1 to 3. The dynamic virtual channel name is the null-terminated [**ANSI character**](#gt_ansi-character) string "Microsoft::Windows::RDS::DisplayControl". The usage of channel names in the context of opening a dynamic virtual channel is specified in [MS-RDPEDYC] section 2.2.2.1.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>

The **DISPLAYCONTROL_MONITOR_LAYOUT_PDU** message is a client-to-server PDU that is used to request a display configuration change on the server, such as the addition of a monitor or a new resolution for an existing monitor. Note that the entire monitor layout MUST be included in the **Monitors** field even if the configuration of only a single monitor is updated.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "Header"
  64-95: "MonitorLayoutSize"
  96-127: "NumMonitors"

<a id="Section_2.2.2.2.1"></a>
##### 2.2.2.2.1 DISPLAYCONTROL_MONITOR_LAYOUT

The **DISPLAYCONTROL_MONITOR_LAYOUT** structure is used to specify the characteristics of a monitor. The coordinates used to describe the monitor position MUST be relative to the upper-left corner of the monitor designated as the "primary display monitor". The upper-left corner of the primary monitor is always (0, 0).

```mermaid
