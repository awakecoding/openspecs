# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Remote Desktop Protocol: Virtual Channel Echo Extension to Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting, as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md). The echo messages defined in section [2.2](#Section_2.2) are used to bounce a payload sent by a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) off of a connected terminal-server client, thereby providing a simple mechanism to determine network characteristics such as [**round-trip time (RTT)**](#gt_round-trip-time-rtt).

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_ansi-character"></a>
**ANSI character**: An 8-bit Windows-1252 character set unit.

<a id="gt_protocol-data-unit-pdu"></a>
**protocol data unit (PDU)**: Information that is delivered as a unit among peer entities of a network and that can contain control information, address information, or data. For more information on remote procedure call (RPC)-specific PDUs, see [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) section 12.

<a id="gt_round-trip-time-rtt"></a>
**round-trip time (RTT)**: The time that it takes a packet to be sent to a remote partner and for that partner's acknowledgment to arrive at the original sender. This is a measurement of latency between partners.

<a id="gt_terminal-server"></a>
**terminal server**: A computer on which terminal services is running.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.2"></a>
## 1.2 References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the [Errata](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=850906).

## 1.3 Overview

The sequence of messages exchanged by the Remote Desktop Protocol: Virtual Channel Echo Extension is described in the following figure. The messages exchanged in this diagram are strictly sequential.

![The echo message sequence](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: The echo message sequence

The [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) originates all Echo Request [**protocol data units (PDUs)**](#gt_protocol-data-unit-pdu) (section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1)). Each Echo Request PDU sent to a terminal-server client contains a sequence of bytes ([MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.1.2) that is sent back to the server in an Echo Response PDU (section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2)).

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Virtual Channel Echo Extension is embedded in a dynamic virtual channel transport, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) sections 1 to 3.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Virtual Channel Echo Extension operates only after the dynamic virtual channel transport, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) sections 1 to 3, is fully established. If the dynamic virtual channel transport is terminated, the Remote Desktop Protocol: Virtual Channel Echo Extension is also terminated. The protocol is terminated by closing the underlying dynamic virtual channel. For details about closing the dynamic virtual channel, refer to [MS-RDPEDYC] section 3.2.5.2.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Virtual Channel Echo Extension is applicable in scenarios where a simple mechanism to determine network characteristics (such as [**round-trip time (RTT)**](#gt_round-trip-time-rtt)) between a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) and a terminal server client is required.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

None.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Virtual Channel Echo Extension is designed to operate over a dynamic virtual channel, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) sections 1 to 3. The dynamic virtual channel name is the null-terminated [**ANSI character**](#gt_ansi-character) string "ECHO". The channel is opened by the server and accepted by client<1> as described in [MS-RDPEDYC] section 3.3.3.2. The usage of channel names in the context of opening a dynamic virtual channel is specified in [MS-RDPEDYC] section 2.2.2.1.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

The following sections specify the Remote Desktop Protocol: Virtual Channel Echo Extension message syntax.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 ECHO_REQUEST_PDU

The ECHO_REQUEST_PDU message is a server-to-client [**PDU**](#gt_protocol-data-unit-pdu) that is used to transmit a sequence of bytes that MUST be echoed back to the server using an ECHO_RESPONSE_PDU message (section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2)).

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "echoRequest (variable)"
```

**echoRequest (variable):** A variable-length array of bytes containing a message that MUST be replayed by the client using an ECHO_RESPONSE_PDU message (section 2.2.2).

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 ECHO_RESPONSE_PDU

The ECHO_RESPONSE_PDU message is a client-to-server [**PDU**](#gt_protocol-data-unit-pdu) that is used to echo the sequence of bytes transmitted in an ECHO_REQUEST_PDU message (section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1)). The ECHO_RESPONSE_PDU message MUST be sent only in response to an ECHO_REQUEST_PDU message.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "echoResponse (variable)"
```

**echoResponse (variable):** A variable-length array of bytes containing the message that was transmitted in the **echoRequest** field of an ECHO_REQUEST_PDU message (section 2.2.1).

### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

**Note** It is possible to implement the following conceptual data by using a variety of techniques as long as the implementation produces external behavior that is consistent with that described in this document.

<a id="Section_3.2.1.1"></a>
#### 3.2.1.1 Echo Byte Stream

The **Echo Byte Stream** store contains the stream of bytes that was embedded in the **echoRequest** field of the most recently received ECHO_REQUEST_PDU message (section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1)).

#### 3.2.5.1 Processing ECHO_REQUEST_PDU

The structure and fields of the ECHO_REQUEST_PDU message are specified in section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1). Upon receiving the ECHO_REQUEST_PDU message, the client MUST save the byte stream that is embedded in the **echoRequest** field to the **Echo Byte Stream** store (section [3.2.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1)). The client then uses this saved data to construct an ECHO_RESPONSE_PDU message (section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2)), which it transmits to the server (section [3.2.5.2](#Section_3.2.5.2)).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2"></a>
#### 3.2.5.2 Sending ECHO_RESPONSE_PDU

The structure and fields of the ECHO_RESPONSE_PDU message are specified in section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2). The **echoResponse** field of the ECHO_RESPONSE_PDU message MUST be populated with the data that was stored in the **Echo Byte Stream** store (section [3.2.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1)) during the processing of the ECHO_REQUEST_PDU message (section [3.2.5.1](#Section_3.2.5.1)).
