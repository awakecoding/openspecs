# 1 Introduction

The Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) Peer-Caching: Peer Authentication Protocol provides authentication for computers in a [**domain**](#gt_domain) in support of the BITS Peer-Caching: Content Retrieval Protocol, as specified in [MS-BPCR](../MS-BPCR/MS-BPCR.md). Peer authentication exchanges [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**Certificate Authority**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) between computers and associates each [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) with a [**Kerberos principal**](#gt_kerberos-principal) in the domain.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_64-bit-network-data-representation-ndr64"></a>
**64-bit Network Data Representation (NDR64)**: A specific instance of a [**remote procedure call (RPC) transfer syntax**](#gt_rpc-transfer-syntax). For more information about [**RPC transfer syntax**](#gt_rpc-transfer-syntax), see [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) section 14.

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: A general-purpose network directory service. [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) also refers to the Windows implementation of a directory service. [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) stores information about a variety of objects in the network. Importantly, user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by the Windows implementation of Kerberos are stored in [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory). [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is either deployed as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS). [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) describes both forms. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD](../MS-AUTHSOD/MS-AUTHSOD.md) section 1.1.1.5.2, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) versions 2 and 3, Kerberos, and DNS.

<a id="gt_active-directory-domain"></a>
**Active Directory domain**: A [**domain**](#gt_domain) hosted on [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory). For more information, see [MS-ADTS].

<a id="gt_certificate"></a>
**certificate**: A certificate is a collection of attributes and extensions that can be stored persistently. The set of attributes in a certificate can vary depending on the intended usage of the certificate. A certificate securely binds a public key to the entity that holds the corresponding private key. A certificate is commonly used for authentication and secure exchange of information on open networks, such as the Internet, extranets, and intranets. Certificates are digitally signed by the issuing [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) and can be issued for a user, a computer, or a service. The most widely accepted format for certificates is defined by the ITU-T X.509 version 3 international standards. For more information about attributes and extensions, see [[RFC3280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90414) and [[X509]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90590) sections 7 and 8.

<a id="gt_certification-authority-ca"></a>
**certification authority (CA)**: A third party that issues public key [**certificates**](#gt_certificate). Certificates serve to bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide whether to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust should be transitive. For more information, see [RFC3280].

<a id="gt_domain"></a>
**domain**: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set must act as a domain controller (DC) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) service. The domain controller provides authentication of members, creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS].

<a id="gt_domain-account"></a>
**domain account**: A stored set of attributes representing a principal used to authenticate a user or machine to an [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) domain.

<a id="gt_dynamic-endpoint"></a>
**dynamic endpoint**: A network-specific server address that is requested and assigned at run time. For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn"></a>
**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**: In [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory), a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that identifies a [**domain**](#gt_domain).

<a id="gt_interface-definition-language-idl"></a>
**Interface Definition Language (IDL)**: The International Standards Organization (ISO) standard language for specifying the interface for remote procedure calls. For more information, see [C706] section 4.

<a id="gt_kerberos-principal"></a>
**Kerberos principal**: A unique individual account known to the Key Distribution Center (KDC). Often a user, but it can be a service offering a resource on the network.

<a id="gt_network-data-representation-ndr"></a>
**Network Data Representation (NDR)**: A specification that defines a mapping from [**Interface Definition Language (IDL)**](#gt_interface-definition-language-idl) data types onto octet streams. [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr) also refers to the runtime environment that implements the mapping facilities (for example, data provided to [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr)). For more information, see [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) and [C706] section 14.

<a id="gt_opnum"></a>
**opnum**: An operation number or numeric identifier that is used to identify a specific [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) method or a method in an interface. For more information, see [C706] section 12.5.2.12 or [MS-RPCE].

<a id="gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc"></a>
**remote procedure call (RPC)**: A context-dependent term commonly overloaded with three meanings. Note that much of the industry literature concerning RPC technologies uses this term interchangeably for any of the three meanings. Following are the three definitions: (*) The runtime environment providing remote procedure call facilities. The preferred usage for this meaning is "RPC runtime". (*) The pattern of request and response message exchange between two parties (typically, a client and a server). The preferred usage for this meaning is "RPC exchange". (*) A single message from an exchange as defined in the previous definition. The preferred usage for this term is "RPC message". For more information about RPC, see [C706].

<a id="gt_rpc-protocol-sequence"></a>
**RPC protocol sequence**: A character string that represents a valid combination of a [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol, a network layer protocol, and a transport layer protocol, as described in [C706] and [MS-RPCE].

<a id="gt_rpc-transfer-syntax"></a>
**RPC transfer syntax**: A method for encoding messages defined in an Interface Definition Language (IDL) file. Remote procedure call (RPC) can support different encoding methods or transfer syntaxes. For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_security-identifier-sid"></a>
**security identifier (SID)**: An identifier for security principals that is used to identify an account or a group. Conceptually, the [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is composed of an account authority portion (typically a [**domain**](#gt_domain)) and a smaller integer representing an identity relative to the account authority, termed the relative identifier (RID). The [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) format is specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.4.2; a string representation of [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2 and [MS-AZOD](../MS-AZOD/MS-AZOD.md) section 1.1.1.2.

<a id="gt_security-provider"></a>
**security provider**: A pluggable security module that is specified by the protocol layer above the [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) layer, and will cause the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) layer to use this module to secure messages in a communication session with the server. The security provider is sometimes referred to as an authentication service. For more information, see [C706] and [MS-RPCE].

<a id="gt_self-signed-certificate"></a>
**self-signed certificate**: A [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) that is signed by its creator and verified using the public key contained in it. Such certificates are also termed root certificates.

<a id="gt_unicode-string"></a>
**Unicode string**: A Unicode 8-bit string is an ordered sequence of 8-bit units, a Unicode 16-bit string is an ordered sequence of 16-bit code units, and a Unicode 32-bit string is an ordered sequence of 32-bit code units. In some cases, it could be acceptable not to terminate with a terminating null character. Unless otherwise specified, all [**Unicode strings**](#gt_unicode-string) follow the UTF-16LE encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [C706] must be used for generating the UUID.

<a id="gt_x509"></a>
**X.509**: An ITU-T standard for public key infrastructure subsequently adapted by the IETF, as specified in [RFC3280].

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

The BITS Peer-Caching: Peer Authentication Protocol allows hosts in an [**Active Directory domain**](#gt_active-directory-domain) to exchange self-signed [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificates**](#gt_certificate) with enough information to associate those certificates securely with a [**domain account**](#gt_domain-account).

Peer authentication is intended for use by hosts that implement the BITS Peer-Caching: Content Retrieval Protocol, as specified in [MS-BPCR](../MS-BPCR/MS-BPCR.md).

Peer authentication uses the Kerberos security system for authentication, allowing each host to do the following:

- Verify that the peer is allowed to participate in content retrieval.
- Associate the received certificate with the peer's Kerberos identity in a trustworthy way.
This protocol is used as part of a distributed peer-to-peer cache of URL content for use by the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) component. (For more information on BITS, see [[MSDN-BITS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89959).) Peer authentication ensures that peer clients and servers are members of the same [**domain**](#gt_domain), or in domains with bidirectional trust.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

A host that implements the client or server role of Peer authentication typically implements the same role in the BITS Peer-Caching: Content Retrieval Protocol, as specified in [MS-BPCR](../MS-BPCR/MS-BPCR.md), and the BITS Peer-Caching: Peer Discovery Protocol, as specified in [MS-BPDP](../MS-BPDP/MS-BPDP.md).

Peer authentication depends upon connection-oriented [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc), as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.3, and relies on the message authentication and security features of the Kerberos Protocol as specified in [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md).

![Relationship to other protocols](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Relationship to other protocols

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The client and server must reside in [**domains**](#gt_domain) with bidirectional trust in order for Kerberos authentication to succeed.

The [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) implementation must support the Kerberos [**security provider**](#gt_security-provider).

Both client and server must be provisioned with [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificates**](#gt_certificate); the subject field of each certificate must be a [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) matching the Kerberos identity of its owner.

The RPC server must be fully initialized before the protocol can start.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is intended for use by hosts that are members of a [**domain**](#gt_domain) and use [**self-signed certificates**](#gt_self-signed-certificate) for authentication during content retrieval. In an environment where certificates are issued from a trusted [**certificate authority**](#gt_certification-authority-ca), the content retrieval client and server ought to be able to authenticate peers without using the BITS Peer-Caching: Peer Authentication Protocol.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

**Supported Transports**: This protocol uses [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over TCP as its only supported transport (as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1)).

**Protocol Version**: This protocol interface has a single version number of 1.0. An RPC client determines whether a method is supported by attempting to invoke the method; if the method is not supported, the RPC server returns an "[**opnum**](#gt_opnum) out of range" error, as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 1.7.<1>

**Security and Authentication Methods**: Authentication and security are provided as specified in [MS-RPCE]. This protocol supports only the Kerberos authentication method.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol uses HRESULT values as defined in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md). Vendors can define their own HRESULT values, provided they set the C bit (0x20000000) for each vendor-defined value, indicating the value is a customer code.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

| Parameter | Value | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interface UUID | e3d0d746-d2af-40fd-8a7a-0d7078bb7092 | As specified in section [3.1](#Section_3.1). |

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

This protocol requires the following [**RPC protocol sequence**](#gt_rpc-protocol-sequence): [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over TCP (ncacn_ip_tcp), as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.1.1.1.

This protocol requires RPC [**dynamic endpoints**](#gt_dynamic-endpoint), as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) Part 4.

This protocol uses security information as described in [MS-RPCE]. The server MUST register the Kerberos [**security provider**](#gt_security-provider).

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Common Data Types

This protocol MUST indicate to the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) runtime that it is to support both the [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr) and [**NDR64**](#gt_64-bit-network-data-representation-ndr64) [**transfer syntaxes**](#gt_rpc-transfer-syntax) and provide a negotiation mechanism for determining which transfer syntax will be used, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3 .

In addition to RPC base types and definitions specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md), additional data types are specified in the following sections.

# 3 Protocol Details

This interface defines a single method, [ExchangePublicKeys](#Section_3.1.4.1), whose purpose is to declare that the client and the server have each been configured with a specific [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) used for authentication in the BITS Peer-Caching: Content Retrieval Protocol, as specified in [MS-BPCR](../MS-BPCR/MS-BPCR.md).

The client calls this method when it needs to initiate a content retrieval session with the server, but it believes that either the client's or server's certificate is not in the corresponding peer's table of allowable certificates. For example, a previous content retrieval call might have failed with an error indicating a certificate problem, or the client might have observed that the server's last known certificate is no longer valid, or the client might be contacting the server for the first time.

The recipient of each certificate is expected to validate the certificate and then add it to the table of peer certificates allowed by the BITS Peer-Caching: Content Retrieval Protocol.

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 BitsPeerAuth Server Details

This interface is identified by [**UUID**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid) "e3d0d746-d2af-40fd-8a7a-0d7078bb7092".

### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.1"></a>
#### 3.1.1.1 Local Certificate (Public)

Local Certificate (Public): The server has access to a single [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) that identifies it to peers during content retrieval. For more information on content retrieval, see [MS-BPCR](../MS-BPCR/MS-BPCR.md) sections 2 and 3.

**Note** The abstract interface notation (Public) indicates that this Abstract Data Model element can be directly accessed from outside this protocol.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.2"></a>
#### 3.1.1.2 Table of Peer Certificates

The server maintains a table of [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificates**](#gt_certificate) corresponding to peers that are allowed to communicate with it via content retrieval. Each certificate is associated with a particular [**Kerberos principal**](#gt_kerberos-principal).

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

No timers are required beyond those specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.3.2.2.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

At initialization time, the server MUST register the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interface and begin listening on a [**dynamic endpoint**](#gt_dynamic-endpoint), as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) part 6.2.2. The server MUST also initialize an empty table of peer [**certificates**](#gt_certificate).

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

This protocol MUST indicate to the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) runtime that it is to perform a strict [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr) data consistency check at target level 6.0, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.

This protocol MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to reject a NULL unique or full pointer with a nonzero conformant value, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 3.

**Binding:** An [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding handle parameter as described in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) section 2.3.1, Binding Handles.

**ClientKeyLength:** Length of the client's local [**certificate**](#gt_certificate), or zero if *ClientKey* is NULL.

**ClientKey:** The client's local certificate, encoded as a [CERTIFICATE_BLOB (section 2.2.2)](#Section_2.2.2). If NULL, the client is choosing not to send a certificate.

**pServerKeyLength:** On output, the length of the server's local certificate. Set to zero if the return value is nonzero, or if *pServerKey* is NULL.

**pServerKey:** On output, the server's local certificate, encoded as a CERTIFICATE_BLOB (section 2.2.2). If NULL, the server is choosing not to return a certificate. Set to NULL if the return value is nonzero. Ignored on the client if the method returns an error or throws an exception.

**Return Values:** An HRESULT indicating return status. See [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) for details of the HRESULT type.

**ERROR_SUCCESS** (0x00000000)

**Exceptions Thrown**: No exceptions are thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

The server MUST first check whether the client's identity, as reported by Kerberos to the RPC layer, is an account in a [**domain**](#gt_domain) that is trusted by the server, returning 0x80070005 if it is not. See [MS-RPCE] section 3.3.3.4.3 for details of acquiring the client identity. The server MAY apply other implementation-specific criteria to the account.<2>

If *ClientKeyLength* is nonzero, the server MUST decode the client certificate. If an error occurs during decoding, the server MUST return a nonzero error. The subject of the client certificate MUST be a [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) string, as defined in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.4.2.1, representing the client's Kerberos identity; otherwise, the server MUST return 0x80070005. If the SID string represents the client's Kerberos identity, the server MUST add the certificate to its table of peer certificates. The server MAY impose implementation-specific limits on the size of the table.<3> If the client certificate is not added because of such a limit, the server MUST return 0x80040006. If the table already contains a certificate corresponding to this client, the server MAY choose whether to replace or augment the prior certificate.<4> The server MUST return zero in either case.

If *ClientKeyLength* is zero, then the server MUST NOT decode the client certificate.

The server MUST encode its own certificate as a CERTIFICATE_BLOB, returning the encoded buffer in *pServerKey*.

If an error occurs during encoding, the server MUST return a nonzero value. Otherwise, the server MUST return zero.

The client and server SHOULD NOT include a [KEY_PROV_INFO](#Section_2.2.2.1.1) property in the CERTIFICATE_BLOB, because it refers to local resources on the sender. Recipients SHOULD ignore the KEY_PROV_INFO property.<5>

The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

<a id="Section_3.2.1.1"></a>
#### 3.2.1.1 Local Certificate (Public)

The client has access to a single [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) that identifies it to peers during content retrieval. For more information on content retrieval, see [MS-BPCR](../MS-BPCR/MS-BPCR.md) sections 2 and 3.

**Note** The abstract interface notation (Public) indicates that the Abstract Data Model element is referenced from outside this protocol

<a id="Section_3.2.1.2"></a>
#### 3.2.1.2 Table of Peer Certificates

The client maintains a table of [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificates**](#gt_certificate) corresponding to peers that are allowed to communicate with it via content retrieval. Each certificate is associated with a particular [**Kerberos principal**](#gt_kerberos-principal).

<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

This protocol uses non-default behavior for the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) Call Timeout timer defined in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.3.2.2.2. The client SHOULD use a timeout of 15,000 milliseconds for the single method of this interface.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

The client MUST direct [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) to use the Kerberos [**security provider**](#gt_security-provider) and require mutual authentication, as specified in [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md) section 3.3.1. The server principal name MUST be the [**domain account**](#gt_domain-account) of the server computer. For example, if the server's [**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**](#gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn) is "sample.corp.contoso.com", then the corresponding server principal name would be "sample$@corp.contoso.com". See [[MSFT-ADN]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=266208) for more information. The client MUST also initialize an empty table of peer [**certificates**](#gt_certificate).

<a id="Section_3.2.4.1"></a>
#### 3.2.4.1 ExchangePublicKeys (Opnum 0)

For the **ExchangePublicKeys** method signature and parameter details, see section [3.1.4.1](#Section_3.1.4.1) under server details. Processing instructions that are unique to the client are covered in this topic.

The client MUST send its local [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) and it MUST encode the certificate as a [CERTIFICATE_BLOB (section 2.2.2)](#Section_2.2.2) and send it in a *ClientKey* parameter.

If the method returns an error or throws an exception, the client MUST ignore the *pServerKey* and *pServerKeyLength* parameters, abort further processing of the method, and return the error to the higher-layer protocol.

If *pServerKeyLength* is zero, the client MUST ignore the value of *pServerKey* and report an error to the higher-layer protocol.

If *pServerKeyLength* is nonzero, the client MUST decode the server certificate. If an error occurs during decoding, the client MUST abort further processing and return the error to the higher-layer protocol.

The subject of the received certificate MUST be a [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) that represents the Kerberos identity of the server; if it is not, the client MUST return an error to the higher-layer protocol. If the SID string represents the Kerberos identity of the server, the client MUST add the certificate to its table of peer certificates. The client MAY impose implementation-specific limits on the size of the table.<6> If the server certificate is not added because of such a limit, the client MUST return an error to the higher-layer protocol. If the table already contains a certificate that corresponds to this server, the client MAY choose whether to replace or augment the prior certificate.<7> In either case, the client MUST indicate success to the higher-layer protocol.

# 4 Protocol Examples

<a id="Section_4.1"></a>
## 4.1 Typical Success Scenario

A common scenario is that the client's table of peer [**certificates**](#gt_certificate) contains a certificate for the server, but the server's table no longer contains the client's certificate. If the client attempts a discovery request via content retrieval, the following exchange of messages occurs. (For more information about content retrieval messages, see [MS-BPCR](../MS-BPCR/MS-BPCR.md).)

Assume the client computer has a [**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**](#gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn) of "client.corp.contoso.com", and its account in [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) has a [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) of S-1-5-21-10-10-10-44. The server computer has a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of "server.corp.contoso.com", and its [**domain account**](#gt_domain-account) has a SID of S-1-5-21-10-10-10-33.

The client's content retrieval layer first opens a TLS connection to the server's content retrieval port, defined in [MS-BPCR] section 1.9. Client and server exchange certificates during TLS connection setup. The client's certificate contains the same string in its subject and issuer fields: "S-1-5-21-10-10-10-44". Similarly, the server's certificate contains "S-1-5-21-10-10-10-33".

The server's content retrieval layer examines the client certificate, discovers it is not in the table of peer certificates, and returns a status of "CertificateNotFound" as defined in [MS-BPCR] section 2.2.1.3.

The client's peer authentication layer creates an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding handle to the server, specifying the Kerberos [**security provider**](#gt_security-provider) and enabling mutual authentication. The expected server principal name is "server$.corp.contoso.com".

The client calls the [ExchangePublicKeys](#Section_3.1.4.1) method in the BitsPeerAuth RPC interface, passing its certificate in *ClientKey*. The client's Kerberos layer verifies that the server process is executing with the correct identity.

The server's [ExchangePublicKeys](#Section_3.1.4.1) routine decodes the client certificate. The server's Kerberos layer identifies the RPC client as "S-1-5-21-10-10-10-44"; the server compares the certificate subject to this SID and finds that they match. The server checks the size of its table of peer certificates; the table has only a few entries and so the server adds the certificate to the table without discarding any other rows. The server then encodes its own certificate and returns it in *pServerKey*.

The client decodes the server certificate. It compares the certificate subject ("S-1-5-21-10-10-10-33") to the SID of the server's Kerberos identity, and finds that they match. The client checks the size of its table of peer certificates; the table has only a few entries and so the client adds the certificate to the table without discarding any other rows.

The client retries the content retrieval request; it succeeds this time because the server finds the client certificate in its table of peer certificates.

<a id="Section_4.2"></a>
## 4.2 Typical Encoded Certificate from Windows Vista

A sample of an encoded [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) from the computer "jroberts21.ntdev.corp.microsoft.com" is shown below.

The first property starts at offset 0 and is of type 0x19 (SUBJECT_PUBLIC_KEY_MD5_HASH).

The second property starts at offset 0x1c and is of type 0x0f (SIGNATURE_HASH).

The third property starts at offset 0x3c and is of type 0x03 (SHA1_HASH).

The fourth property starts at offset 0x5c and is of type 0x09 (ENHKEY_USAGE).

The DER-encoded extension data is as follows:

0060 30 14 06 08 2b 06 01 05 0...+...

0070 05 07 03 01 06 08 2b 06 01 05 05 07 03 02 ......+.......

This is decoded as follows:

30 = Sequence (section 8.9 of [X690])

14 = length

06 = object ID (section 8.4 of [X680])

08 = length

2b = { 1.3 } (from section 8.19.4 of [X690])

06 01 05 05 07 03 01 = id-kp-serverAuth

(section 4.2.1.13 of [RFC3280])

06 = object ID (section 8.4 of [X680])

08 = length

2b = { 1.3 } (from section 8.19.4 of [X690])

06 01 05 05 07 03 02= id-kp-clientAuth

(section 4.2.1.13 of [RFC3280])

The fifth property starts at offset 0x7e and is of type 0x04 (MD5_HASH).

The sixth property starts at offset 0x9a and is of type 0x14 (KEY_IDENTIFIER).

The certificate starts at offset 0xba, with the DER-encoded data starting at offset 0xc6. Note that the subject and issuer fields near offsets 0x101 and 0x15c each contain the [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) of the computer's [**domain account**](#gt_domain-account). For better readability, the certificate also contains a Subject Alternative Name extension at offset 0x232, with the actual name beginning at 0x23e.

## 5.2 Index of Security Parameters

| Security parameter | Section |
| --- | --- |
| Kerberos [**security provider**](#gt_security-provider) required | As specified in section [1.5](#Section_1.5). |
| Security parameters in encoded [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) properties | As specified in section [2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.1). |
| Mutual authentication required | As specified in section [3.2.3](#Section_3.1.3). |

<a id="Section_6"></a>
# 6 Appendix A: Full IDL

For ease of implementation, the full [**IDL**](#gt_interface-definition-language-idl) is provided, where "ms-rpce.idl" is the IDL found in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) Appendix A.

import "ms-dtyp.idl";

# 7 Appendix B: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental software. References to product versions include released service packs.

- Windows Vista operating system
- Windows Server 2008 operating system
Exceptions, if any, are noted below. If a service pack or Quick Fix Engineering (QFE) number appears with the product version, behavior changed in that service pack or QFE. The new behavior also applies to subsequent service packs of the product unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.7: Windows [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol returns RPC_S_PROCNUM_OUT_OF_RANGE to notify the client that an RPC method is out of range, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

<2> Section 3.1.4.1: Windows verifies that the identity, reported from Kerberos to RPC, is a computer account, not a user account.

<3> Section 3.1.4.1: Windows limits the table to 100 entries. If the table already contains a [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) for the client [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid), that certificate is deleted and the new one is inserted into the table. Otherwise, the server sorts the certificates according to the time they were inserted into the table and chooses the oldest. If more than one minute has elapsed since its insertion, the server deletes that row of the table and inserts the new certificate. Otherwise, the server returns 0x80040006.

<4> Section 3.1.4.1: Windows replaces the prior certificate.

<5> Section 3.1.4.1: When sending a [CERTIFICATE_BLOB](#Section_2.2.2), the Windows client and server remove the [KEY_PROV_INFO](#Section_2.2.2.1.1)_property from the certificate. When receiving a CERTIFICATE_BLOB, the Windows client and server store the property with the other certificate attributes.

<6> Section 3.2.4.1: Windows limits the table to 100 entries. If the table already contains a certificate for the server SID, that certificate is deleted and the new one is inserted into the table. Otherwise, the client sorts the certificates according to the times when they were inserted into the table and chooses the oldest. If more than one minute has elapsed since certificate insertion, the client deletes that row of the table and inserts the new certificate. Otherwise, the server certificate is discarded and an error is reported to the higher-layer protocol.

<7> Section 3.2.4.1: Windows replaces the prior certificate.
