# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Remote Desktop Protocol: Serial and Parallel Port Virtual Channel Extension. This protocol is used to redirect serial and parallel ports from a [**terminal client**](#gt_terminal-client) to the [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server). This allows the [**server**](#gt_server) to access [**client**](#gt_client) ports as if the connected devices were local to the server.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_client"></a>
**client**: A computer on which the remote procedure call (RPC) client is executing.

<a id="gt_device-control"></a>
**device control**: Driver-specific operations that can be performed on various drivers. Each DeviceIOControl is associated with an operation code (called IoCode) and optionally input and output buffers. Device drivers depending on the IoCode take various actions on the input and output buffers

<a id="gt_pseudo-device"></a>
**pseudo device**: A virtual device object created by the server to represent a remote device attached to the remote (or client) machine. Applications and drivers on the server interact with this pseudo/virtual device and the server forwards requests to the remote device. Responses from the remote device are returned to the pseudo device, which then forwards them to the applications or drivers interacting with the device. Examples of pseudo devices include the pseudo port device, pseudo printer device, pseudo drive device, pseudo smartcard device, pseudo PnP device, and so on.

<a id="gt_remote-device"></a>
**remote device**: A device that is attached to a remote (or [**client**](#gt_client)) machine, in contrast to a device physically attached to a machine.

<a id="gt_server"></a>
**server**: A computer on which the remote procedure call (RPC) server is executing.

<a id="gt_terminal-client"></a>
**terminal client**: A [**client**](#gt_client) of a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server). A terminal client program that runs on the [**client**](#gt_client) machine.

<a id="gt_terminal-server"></a>
**terminal server**: A computer on which terminal services is running.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Serial and Parallel Port Virtual Channel Extension specifies the communication used to enable the redirection of serial and parallel ports (ports for short) between a [**terminal client**](#gt_terminal-client) and a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server). By redirecting ports from the terminal client to the terminal server, applications running on a server machine can access the [**remote devices**](#gt_remote-device) attached to those ports.

<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 Purpose of Device Redirection Extensions

This extension enables the redirection of serial and parallel port devices attached to the terminal client. With the redirection, such devices can then be accessed by the applications running on the server.

<a id="Section_1.3.2"></a>
### 1.3.2 Protocol Initialization

This extension can be considered as a subprotocol within the Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md). It follows the initialization of the Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension to enable port redirection.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This extension can be considered as a subprotocol within Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md). This extension extends the Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension to enable port redirection.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Serial and Parallel Port Virtual Channel Extension operates only after the Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension transport, as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md), is fully established.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Serial and Parallel Port Virtual Channel Extension is designed to be run within the context of a Remote Desktop Protocol virtual channel established between a [**client**](#gt_client) and [**server**](#gt_server). This protocol extension is applicable when applications running on the [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) need to access the ports physically located on a client machine.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This extension relies on the Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension, as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md), to perform basic versioning and capability negotiation.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol uses NTSTATUS values, as defined in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.3. Vendors are free to choose their own values for this field, as long as the C bit (0x20000000) is set, indicating it is a customer code.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Serial and Parallel Port Virtual Channel Extension contains no standards assignments.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

Because this is a subprotocol of Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension, as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md), this extension shares messages and common data types already specified in [MS-RDPEFS]. This section describes the messages and data types used by Remote Desktop Protocol: Serial and Parallel Port Virtual Channel Extension.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

All messages MUST be transported over an established Remote Desktop Protocol device extensions channel (as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.1).

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

The following sections contain Remote Desktop Protocol: Serial and Parallel Port Virtual Channel Extension message syntax.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Common Data Types

Port redirection uses common data types specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 Port Redirection Messages

This protocol does not define any specific messages. It uses a subset of the messages specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2. The messages in the following sections are used by this protocol.

<a id="Section_2.2.2.1"></a>
#### 2.2.2.1 Client Device List Announce Request

This message is described in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.2.9. The port redirection [**client**](#gt_client) generates the elements of type DEVICE_ANNOUNCE (as specified in [MS-RDPEFS] section 2.2.1.3) for the port devices it wants to redirect.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-31: "DeviceAnnounceHeader"
```

**DeviceAnnounceHeader (4 bytes):** For each redirected port a DEVICE_ANNOUNCE header (as specified in [MS-RDPEFS] section 2.2.1.3) is generated by the client port redirection extension.

The header fields are initialized as follows:

- **DeviceType**: Identifies the device. This value MUST be set to RDPDR_DTYP_PARALLEL for parallel ports and RDPDR_DTYP_SERIAL for serial ports.
- **DeviceId**: A unique ID that identifies the announced device. The **DeviceId** field follows the semantics described in [MS-RDPEFS] section 2.2.1.3.
- **PreferredDosName**: This field follows the semantic described in [MS-RDPEFS] section 2.2.1.3. It describes the name of the port device as it appears on the client. This protocol does not enforce any semantic limitations on port naming. Client and server implementations determine the port naming convention.<1>
- **DeviceDataLength**: Number of bytes in the **DeviceData** field. For port devices, this value is set to 0.
**Note:** The Client Drive Device List Remove message is not supported by the MS-RDPESP protocol.

<a id="Section_2.2.2.2"></a>
#### 2.2.2.2 Server Create Request (DR_PORT_CREATE_REQ)

This message is sent by the [**server**](#gt_server) to open an instance of the port device. The packet for this message is specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.1.4.1 (DR_CREATE_REQ). The **DeviceId** of the **DeviceIoRequest** field in the DR_CREATE_REQ packet MUST match the **DeviceId** value that is sent in the [Client Device List Announce Request](#Section_2.2.2.1) packet.

The **PathLength** field of the DR_CREATE_REQ packet MUST be set to 0x00000000. This automatically results in setting the packet **Path** field to empty.

Some of the parameters that are passed with this request (**DesiredAccess**, **AllocationSize**, **FileAttributes**, **SharedAccess**, **Disposition** and **CreateOptions**) are treated as opaque by this protocol. The interpretation of these parameters is determined by the client-side driver. The various possible values are specified in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 2.2.13.

<a id="Section_2.2.2.3"></a>
#### 2.2.2.3 Server Close Request (DR_PORT_CLOSE_REQ)

This message is sent from the [**server**](#gt_server) to close the previously-opened device instance. The packet is specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.1.4.2 (DR_CLOSE_REQ).

<a id="Section_2.2.2.4"></a>
#### 2.2.2.4 Server Read Request (DR_PORT_READ_REQ)

This message is sent from the [**server**](#gt_server) to read data from the port device instance. The packet is specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.1.4.3 (DR_READ_REQ).

The **Offset** field in this request MUST be set to 0.

Zero-length request semantics: The protocol allows the client and server to request or to complete read/write operations with the **Length** field set to zero. The behavior of these requests and their interpretation is determined by the server application and the client driver.

<a id="Section_2.2.2.5"></a>
#### 2.2.2.5 Server Write Request (DR_PORT_WRITE_REQ)

This message is sent from the server to write data to the port device instance. The packet is specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.1.4.4 (DR_WRITE_REQ).

The **Offset** field in this request MUST be set to 0.

Zero-length request semantics: The protocol allows the [**client**](#gt_client) and [**server**](#gt_server) to request or to complete read/write operations with the **Length** field set to zero. The behavior of these requests and their interpretation is determined by the server application and the client driver.

<a id="Section_2.2.2.6"></a>
#### 2.2.2.6 Server Device Control Request (DR_PORT_CONTROL_REQ)

This message is sent by the server to request a [**device control**](#gt_device-control) operation. The packet is specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.1.4.5 (DR_CONTROL_REQ).

The possible values for the **IoControlCode** member and the corresponding Input and Output buffers applicable to parallel and serial ports are as defined in [[MSFT-WDDK]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=507676), and in [[MSDN-PORTS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=102069).

# 3 Protocol Details

The following sections specify protocol details, including abstract data models and message processing rules.

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Common Details

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The organization is provided to explain how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Serial and Parallel Port Virtual Channel Extension follows the abstract data model specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 3.1.1.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

There are no common timers.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension MUST be initialized before the ports can be redirected. This initialization is complete when the client sends the Client Core Capability Response, as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.2.8.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

IO requests are generated in response to IO calls that the server applications make on the redirected device. Otherwise, no higher-layer triggered events are used.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The common message processing events and rules that are described in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 3.1.5 apply to this protocol. For client-specific and server-specific message processing, see sections [3.2.5](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) and [3.3.5](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md).

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1"></a>
#### 3.2.5.1 Port Redirection Messages

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.1"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.1 Sending a Client Device List Announce Request Message

After Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension finishes initialization by sending a Client Core Capability Response message, as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.2.8, the [**client**](#gt_client) sends a DR_CORE_DEVICELIST_ANNOUNCE_REQ message to the [**server**](#gt_server) along with information for various devices, as specified in [MS-RDPEFS] section 2.2.2.9. The device type is set to RDPDR_TYP_SERIAL for serial port type devices and RDPDR_TYP_PARALLEL for parallel ports. The port extension prepares the port devices information that goes into this packet. The port-specific structure is specified in section [2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.1).

The port redirection extension enumerates the local serial and parallel ports that need to be redirected. It MUST set the appropriate **PreferredDosName** fields, generate unique IDs for the devices, set the appropriate device types, and let the Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension send the information over to the server.

The **DeviceId** field generated in this message is used to refer to this port in subsequent messages.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.2"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.2 Processing a Server Create Request Message

After receiving the create request, the [**client**](#gt_client) SHOULD open and prepare the port for IO operations. The opened instance of the port is maintained by the client as a **FileId** field of the DR_DEVICE_IOREQUEST message, as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.1.4. This ID is used to refer to subsequent IO operations on the port instance. After the create request processing is complete, the client responds with a create response message (section [3.2.5.1.7](#Section_3.2.5.1.7)).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.3"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.3 Processing a Server Close Request Message

The **DeviceId** and **FileId** fields of DR_DEVICE_IOREQUEST (as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.1.4) identify the previously-opened instance of the port to operate on.

After receiving the close request, the [**client**](#gt_client) MUST close the previously opened port instance. It MUST also cancel pending IO operations, if any, on the port. The client MUST respond with close response message (section [3.2.5.1.8](#Section_3.2.5.1.8)).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.4"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.4 Processing a Server Read Request Message

The **DeviceId** and **FileId** fields of DR_DEVICE_IOREQUEST (as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.1.4) identify the previously opened instance of the port to operate on.

The **Length** and **Offset** fields of DR_READ_REQ (as specified in [MS-RDPEFS] section 2.2.1.4.3) identify the length and offset values requested by the [**server**](#gt_server) for this operation.

If the **Offset** field is not set to 0, the value MUST be ignored.

The client MUST perform the read operation on the instance of the port accordingly. After the read operation is complete, the client MUST send a read response message (section [3.2.5.1.9](#Section_3.2.5.1.9)) to let the server know about the result of the operation.

The semantics of read requests are determined by the client-side driver. The protocol allows partial read results. The result of the read operations, including the data read, is passed to the server and is considered opaque to the protocol.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.5"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.5 Processing a Server Write Request Message

The **DeviceId** and **FileId** fields of DR_DEVICE_IOREQUEST (as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.1.4) identify the previously opened instance of the port to operate on.

The **Length** and **WriteData** fields of DR_WRITE_REQ (as specified in [MS-RDPEFS] section 2.2.1.4.4) identify the parameters for the write operation. The **Offset** field is ignored.

The [**client**](#gt_client) MUST perform the write operation on the instance of the port accordingly. After the operation is complete, the client MUST send response message DR_WRITE_RSP (as specified in [MS-RDPEFS] section 2.2.1.5.4) to let the [**server**](#gt_server) know about the result of the operation.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.6"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.6 Processing a Server Device Control Request Message

The **DeviceId** and **FileId** fields of DR_DEVICE_IOREQUEST (as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.1.4) identify the previously-opened instance of the port to operate on.

The **OutputBufferLength**, **InputBufferLength**, **IoControlCode** and **InputBuffer** fields of DR_CONTROL_REQ (as specified in [MS-RDPEFS] section 2.2.1.4.5) identify the parameters for the [**device control**](#gt_device-control) operation.

The client MUST perform the device control operation specified by the **IoControlCode** field on the instance of the port accordingly. After the operation is complete, the client MUST send a Device Control Response message (section [3.2.5.1.11](#Section_3.2.5.1.11)) to notify the server about the result of the operation.<2>

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.7"></a>

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

There are no security considerations for Remote Desktop Protocol: Serial and Parallel Port Virtual Channel Extension messages because all static virtual channel traffic is secured by the underlying Remote Desktop Protocol core protocol. The implemented security-related mechanisms are specified in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md) section 5.

# 6 Appendix A: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

- Windows 2000 operating system
- Windows XP operating system
- Windows Server 2003 operating system
- Windows Vista operating system
- Windows Server 2008 operating system
- Windows 7 operating system
- Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system
- Windows 8 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 operating system
- Windows 8.1 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system
- Windows 10 operating system
- Windows Server 2016 operating system
- Windows Server operating system
- Windows Server 2019 operating system
- Windows Server 2022 operating system
- Windows 11 operating system
- Windows Server 2025 operating system
Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 2.2.2.1: Windows uses symbolic link names with standard naming conventions in its server implementations, in order to ensure compatibility with most Windows applications and drivers that access ports.

For serial ports, Windows assigns a symbolic link name that uses the standard naming convention "COM<n>", where <n> is the COM port number.

For parallel ports, Windows assigns a symbolic link name that uses the standard naming convention "LPT<n>", where <n> is the LPT port number.

For more information on port naming conventions, see [[MSDN-PORTS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=102069).

<2> Section 3.2.5.1.6: Windows Implementations use IOCTL constants for **IoControlCode** values. The content and values of the IOCTLs are opaque to the protocol. On the server side, the data contained in an IOCTL is simply packaged and sent to the client side. For maximum compatibility between the different versions of the Windows operating system, the client implementation only singles out critical IOCTLs and invokes the applicable Win32 port API. The other IOCTLS are passed directly to the client-side driver, and the processing of this value depends on the drivers installed on the client side. The values and parameters for these IOCTLS can be found in [[MSFT-WDDK]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=507676) and in [MSDN-PORTS].

The parameters of the device request/response are mapped to the IOCTL as described in [MSDN-PORTS] as follows:

- If an IOCTL requires input, then the AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer is set to the content of **InputBuffer** field and the **InputBufferSize** field is assigned to Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength.
- If an IOCTL requires output, then the Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength is filled with the value of **OutputBufferLength** of the request. The **OutputBuffer** field in the response contains the data from AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer, and the **OutputBufferLength** in the response is set to the returned value in the **Information** field of the I/O Status Block.
- The **IoStatus** field of the response contains the returned NTSTATUS code from the IOCTL.
For more information about parallel and serial device codes and the related IO structures, see [[MSDN-Ntddpar]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=114013) and [[MSDN-Ntddser]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=114014).

For more information about device type values, see [[MSDN-DeviceTypes]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=120804).

For more information about I/O control codes and the CTL_CODE macro, see [[MSDN-IoCtlCodes]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=120805).
