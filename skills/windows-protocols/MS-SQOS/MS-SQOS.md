# 1 Introduction

The Storage Quality of Service (QoS) Protocol is a block-based protocol that is used to manage the Quality of Service configuration of I/O flows targeting remote files accessed over SMB3.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_base-io-size"></a>
**base I/O size**: A configurable parameter on logical flows indicating the value to be used to compute [**normalized IOPS**](#gt_normalized-inputoutput-operations-per-second-normalized-iops) units.

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_little-endian"></a>
**little-endian**: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the least significant byte stored in the memory location with the lowest address.

<a id="gt_logical-flow"></a>
**logical flow**: A stream of I/O operations to be treated as a single indivisible flow for the purpose of measuring and controlling its performance characteristics (e.g. throughput or latency).

<a id="gt_normalized-inputoutput-operations-per-second-normalized-iops"></a>
**normalized input/output operations per second (normalized IOPS)**: A unit of measurement for storage I/O throughput. "1 IOPS" is defined as the transfer rate of one block of data that is equal to or less than the base I/O size per second.

<a id="gt_null-guid"></a>
**NULL GUID**: A [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) of all zeros.

<a id="gt_qos-policy"></a>
**QoS Policy**: The set of parameters that completely define the Quality of Service requirements for a logical flow or for a set of logical flows.

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world. The [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) standard [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16 BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The Storage Quality of Service (QoS) Protocol allows a client application to perform the following high-level operations:

- Define a [**logical flow**](#gt_logical-flow) and specify a [**QoS Policy**](#gt_qos-policy) for the logical flow.
- Provide data used to compute I/O performance metrics for a logical flow.
- Retrieve status information for a logical flow.
The Storage QoS protocol is used to exchange configuration, metric and status data between the client and the server. The protocol allows a storage flow to be identified and a policy to be assigned to the operations belonging to the flow. For the purpose of illustrating the protocol behaviors, this specification assumes that on the server side there exists a Storage QoS implementation that is responsible for implementing policies by performing tasks such as collecting metrics, computing I/O rates for logical flows, determining status of logical flows, and manipulating I/O request queues to satisfy throughput requirements.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol depends on Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol Version 3 for its transport, as specified in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Storage QoS Protocol has the following preconditions:

- An SMB client has established a connection to an SMB server and has opened a remote file. This has to be done before a client can issue any Storage QoS Protocol commands.
<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Storage QoS Protocol is applicable for all scenarios that access a remote file between a Storage QoS-aware client and a server operating in a Storage QoS-managed environment.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

The Storage Quality of Service Protocol has two versions.<1>

| Version | Dialect Revision | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Storage QoS Protocol Version 1.0 | SQoS dialect 1.0 | 0x0100 |
| Storage QoS Protocol Version 1.1 | SQoS dialect 1.1 | 0x0101 |

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

This protocol shares the standards assignments of Server Message Block Protocol Versions 2 and 3, as specified in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 1.9.

## 2.1 Transport

The following sections specify how Storage QoS Protocol messages are encapsulated on the wire and common protocol data types used.

Unless otherwise specified, multiple-byte fields (16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit fields) in the Storage QoS Protocol message MUST be transmitted in [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) order (least-significant byte first).

Unless otherwise indicated, numeric fields are integers of the specified byte length.

Unless otherwise specified, all textual strings MUST be in [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) version 5.0 format, as specified in [[UNICODE]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90550), using the 16-bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-16) form of the encoding. Textual strings with separate fields identifying the length of the string MUST NOT be null-terminated unless otherwise specified.

Unless otherwise noted, fields marked as "Reserved" MUST be set to 0 when being sent and MUST be ignored when received. These fields are reserved for future protocol expansion and MUST NOT be used for implementation-specific functionality.

### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

<a id="Section_3.1.4.1"></a>
#### 3.1.4.1 Application Issues a Storage Quality of Service Control Request for a Logical Flow

Before issuing a Storage Quality of Service Control request, the client MUST have already established a connection to the server by calling the interface specified in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.4.2 and providing the following input parameters:

- The application-provided server name.
- The application-provided share name.
- The application-provided user credentials.
If the connection is successfully established, the client MUST open the remote file by calling the interface specified in [MS-SMB2] section 3.2.4.3 and provide the following input parameters:

- File name
After opening the remote file, in order to issue a Storage Quality of Service Request for the remote file, the client MUST construct a STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_REQUEST structure, as specified in section [2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2), as follows:

- All fields of the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_REQUEST structure SHOULD initially be set to zero.
- The **ProtocolVersion** field MUST be set to an implementation-specific value<3>.
- The **Options** field MUST contain at least one of the flags defined in section 2.2.2.2, as specified in the rest of this section and in section [3.1.6](#Section_3.1.6).
- If the **Options** field includes the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_GET_STATUS flag, the maximum output buffer size MUST be at least 80 (size of STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_RESPONSE).
- If the handle to the **Open** has not yet been associated to a logical flow, the **Options** field MUST include the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_SET_LOGICAL_FLOW_ID flag and **LogicalFlowID** must be set to a non-empty GUID.
- If the **Options** field includes the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_PROBE_POLICY flag, the **LogicalFlowID** MUST NOT be set to an empty GUID.
- If the **Options** field includes the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_UPDATE_COUNTERS flag the client MUST set the following request fields:
- **IoCountIncrement** is set to **LogicalFlow.IoCountIncrement**
- **NormalizedIoCountIncrement** is set to **LogicalFlow.NormalizedIoCountIncrement**
- **LatencyIncrement** is set to **LogicalFlow.LatencyIncrement**
- **LowerLatencyIncrement** is set to **LogicalFlow.LowerLatencyIncrement**
- If **Dialect** is 1.1, then **KilobyteCountIncrement** is set to **LogicalFlow.KilobyteCountIncrement**
The client MUST ensure the following after sending the request:

- **LogicalFlow.IoCountIncrement** is set to zero.
- **LogicalFlow.NormalizedIoCountIncrement** is set to zero.
- **LogicalFlow.LatencyIncrement** is set to zero.
- **LogicalFlow.LowerLatencyIncrement** is set to zero.

### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>
#### 3.1.5.1 Receiving a Storage Quality of Service Control Response

If the response returned by the server indicates failure the client SHOULD set the **LogicalFlow.StatusRequestTimer** to expire within implementation-specific<4> default interval.

If the response returned by the server indicates STATUS_SUCCESS:

- The client MUST set **LogicalFlow.MaximumIoRate** to the **MaximumIoRate** value received in the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_RESPONSE buffer.
- If **Dialect** is 1.1, then the client MUST set **LogicalFlow.MaximumBandwidth** to the **MaximumBandwidth** value received in the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_RESPONSE buffer.
- If the **TimeToLive** value received in the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_RESPONSE is greater than 1000, the client MUST set **LogicalFlow.StatusRequestTimer** to expire within **TimeToLive** milliseconds. Otherwise, the client MUST set **LogicalFlow.StatusRequestTimer** to expire within an implementation-specific<5> default interval.
- The client MUST set **LogicalFlow.BaseIoSize** to the **BaseIoSize** value received in the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_RESPONSE buffer.
<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>
### 3.1.6 Timer Events

When the client issues a Storage QoS Request with the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_SET_POLICY set in the **Options** field, the client SHOULD either include the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_GET_STATUS flag in the same request, or ensure that **LogicalFlow.StatusRequestTimer** will expire within 1 second.

When **LogicalFlow.StatusRequestTimer** expires, the client SHOULD issue a STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_REQUEST with **Options** including at least the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_GET_STATUS and STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_UPDATE_COUNTERS flags. If the logical flow is idle at the time the timer expires (that is, there are no I/O requests in progress), the client MAY delay the status request until new I/O requests are available.

<a id="Section_3.1.7"></a>
### 3.1.7 Other Local Events

<a id="Section_3.1.7.1"></a>
#### 3.1.7.1 Initiating Read or Write Requests for a Logical Flow

If **LogicalFlow.MaximumIoRate** is greater than zero or if the client implements the SQoS 1.1 dialect and **LogicalFlow.MaximumBandwidth** is greater than zero, the client MUST limit the average I/O initiation rate for the logical flow to the value indicated by **LogicalFlow.MaximumIoRate**, or if the client implements the SQoS 1.1 dialect, the minimum of **LogicalFlow.MaximumIoRate** and **LogicalFlow.MaximumBandwidth**.

<a id="Section_3.2"></a>
## 3.2 Server Details

<a id="Section_3.2.1.2"></a>
#### 3.2.1.2 Per Open

**LogicalFlowID**: The GUID of the logical flow to which the Open is currently associated. If this value is an empty GUID, the Open is not associated to any logical flow.

<a id="Section_3.2.1.3"></a>
#### 3.2.1.3 Per Logical Flow

**LogicalFlowID**: The GUID of the logical flow.

**PolicyID**: The GUID of the Storage QoS policy currently associated to the logical flow.

**InitiatorID**: The GUID of the initiator currently associated to the logical flow.

**Limit**: The client-defined limit currently requested for the logical flow, in normalized IOPS.

**Reservation**: The client-defined reservation currently requested for the logical flow, in normalized IOPS.

**InitiatorName**: The name of the initiator currently associated to the logical flow.

**InitiatorNodeName**: The name of the initiator node currently associated to the logical flow.

**BaseIoSize**: The base I/O size used to compute the normalized size of an I/O request for the logical flow.

If the server implements the SQoS 1.1 dialect:

**BandwidthLimit**: The client-defined bandwidth limit currently requested for the logical flow, in kilobyte per second units.

<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

**Dialect** MUST be set to the highest dialect that the server implements.<6>

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

<a id="Section_3.2.4.1"></a>
#### 3.2.4.1 Handling a Storage Quality of Service Control Request

The calling application provides:

- A handle identifying the **Open**.
- Storage QoS Control Request structure, indicated by **Request**. The total size of the request, including variable length fields, is indicated by **RequestSize**.
- The maximum size of the response that will be accepted by the client, indicated by **MaxResponseSize**.
The server MUST process this request as specified in section [3.2.5.1](#Section_3.2.5.1).

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1"></a>
#### 3.2.5.1 Receiving a Storage Quality of Service Control Request

If the server does not support the Storage Quality of Service function, it SHOULD fail the request with STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST.

Otherwise, the server MUST process a Storage Quality of Service Request as follows:

If **Request.ProtocolVersion** does not match one of the values defined in section [1.7](#Section_1.7), the server MUST fail the request with error STATUS_REVISION_MISMATCH.<7>

If **Request.Options** does not include at least one of the flags defined in section [2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2), the server MUST fail the request with error STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.

If **Request.Options** includes the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_PROBE_POLICY flag and the **Open** is currently associated to a logical flow, the server MUST ignore the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_PROBE_POLICY flag for the rest of the processing.

The server MUST follow the processing rules described in sections [3.2.5.1.1](#Section_3.2.5.1.1), [3.2.5.1.2](#Section_3.2.5.1.2), [3.2.5.1.3](#Section_3.2.5.1.3), and [3.2.5.1.4](#Section_3.2.5.1.4).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.1"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.1 Handling a Request to Associate an Open to a Logical Flow

If **Request.Options** includes the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_SET_LOGICAL_FLOW_ID or STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_PROBE_POLICY flags and **Request.LogicalFlowID** is set to a non-empty GUID, the server MUST look up the specified GUID in **LogicalFlowTable**. If an entry is not found, the server MUST create a new logical with GUID equal to **Request.LogicalFlowID** and add it to the **LogicalFlowTable**. The server MUST associate the Open with the logical flow identified by **Request.LogicalFlowID**.

If **Request.Options** includes the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_PROBE_POLICY flag and **Request.LogicalFlowID** is set to an empty GUID, the server MUST fail the request with error STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.

If **Request.Options** includes the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_SET_LOGICAL_FLOW_ID flag and **Request.LogicalFlowID** is set to an empty GUID, the server MUST remove the association between the Open and the logical flow currently associated to the **Open**. The **Open** MUST NOT be associated with any other logical flow.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.2"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.2 Handling a Request to Set or Probe Policy for a Logical Flow

If **Request.Options** includes the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_SET_POLICY and the **Open** is not associated to a logical flow, the server MUST fail the request with error STATUS_NOT_FOUND.

The rest of the processing rules in this section apply only if **Request.Options** includes the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_SET_POLICY or STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_PROBE_POLICY flag.

The server MUST fail the request with error STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER if any of the following conditions is true:

- **Request.InitiatorNameLength** is greater than STORAGE_QOS_INITIATOR_NAME_SIZE.
- **Request.InitiatorNameLength** is greater than 0 and **Request.InitiatorNameOffset** is less than 104.

- **Request.InitiatorNodeNameLength** is greater than 0 and **Request.InitiatorNodeNameOffset** is less than 104.
- (**Request.InitiatorNodeNameLength** + **Request.InitiatorNodeNameOffset**) is greater than **RequestSize**.
The server MUST fail the request with error STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER if it determines that any of the following fields has an invalid value<8>:

- **Request.PolicyID**
- **Request.InitiatorID**
- **Request.Limit**
- **Request.Reservation**
- If **Dialect** is 1.1, **Request.BandwidthLimit**
If **Request.InitiatorNameLength** is greater than zero, the server MUST update **LogicalFlow.InitiatorName** to **Request.InitiatorName**.

If **Request.InitiatorNodeNameLength** is greater than zero, the server MUST update **LogicalFlow.InitiatorNodeName** to **Request.InitiatorNodeName**.

The server MUST update the policy parameters associated to the logical flow associated with the **Open** as follows:

- **LogicalFlow.PolicyID** is set to **Request.PolicyID**.
- **LogicalFlow.InitiatorID** is set to **Request.InitiatorID**.
- **LogicalFlow.Limit** is set to **Request.Limit**.
- **LogicalFlow.Reservation** is set to **Request.Reservation**.
- If the server implements Storage QoS Protocol Version 1.1, **LogicalFlow.BandwidthLimit** is set to **Request.BandwidthLimit**.
<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.3"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.3 Handling a Request to Update Counters for a Logical Flow

If **Request.Options** includes the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_UPDATE_COUNTERS flag and the **Open** is not associated to a logical flow, the server MUST fail the request with error STATUS_NOT_FOUND.

If **Request.Options** does not include the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_FLAG_UPDATE_COUNTERS flag, the server MUST ignore the values of the following fields:

- **Request.IoCountIncrement**
- **Request.NormalizedIoCountIncrement**
- **Request.LatencyIncrement**
- **Request.LowerLatencyIncrement**
- If **Dialect** is 1.1, **Request.KilobyteCountIncrement**
<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.4"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.4 Handling a Request to Query Status Information for a Logical Flow

The following processing rules apply only when **Request.Options** includes the STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_GET_STATUS flag.

If **MaxResponseSize** is less than 80 (size of STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_RESPONSE) the server MUST fail the request with error STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.

If the **Open** is not associated to a logical flow the server MUST fail the request with error STATUS_NOT_FOUND.

The server MUST construct a STORAGE_QOS_CONTROL_RESPONSE structure as specified in section [2.2.2.3](#Section_2.2.2.3) with the following values:

- **ProtocolVersion** MUST be set to one of the values listed in section [1.7](#Section_1.7).
- **Options** MUST be set 0.
- **LogicalFlowID** MUST be set to **Open.LogicalFlowID**.
- **PolicyID** MUST be set to **LogicalFlow.PolicyID**.
- **InitiatorID** MUST be set to **LogicalFlow.InitiatorID**.
- **TimeToLive** MUST be set to a positive value indicating the expected period of validity, in milliseconds, of the returned status information for the logical flow. The server SHOULD use implementation-dependent means to obtain the current expected period of validity.
- **Status** MUST be set to one of the values defined in section [2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.1), representing the current status of the logical flow.
- **MaximumIoRate** MUST be set to the maximum I/O rate assigned to the logical flow.
- **MinimumIoRate** MUST be set to the minimum I/O rate assigned to the logical flow.
- If **Dialect** is 1.1, **MaximumBandwidth** MUST be set to the maximum bandwidth assigned to the logical flow.
- **BaseIoSize** MUST be set to **LogicalFlow.BaseIoSize**.<9>
The response MUST be sent to the client.

If the server has not failed the request for any of the reasons described earlier, the server MUST return STATUS_SUCCESS to the client.

# 4 Protocol Examples

The following section describes common scenarios that indicate normal traffic flow in order to illustrate the function of the Storage Quality of Service Protocol.

<a id="Section_4.1"></a>
## 4.1 Computing Normalized I/O Size

The following formula can be used to convert the size of an I/O request in bytes (**IoSizeInBytes**) to an I/O size expressed in normalized units (**NormalizedIoSize**):

**NormalizedIoSize** = (**IoSizeInBytes** + **BaseIoSize** - 1) / **BaseIoSize** where **NormalizedIoSize**, **IoSizeInBytes**, and **BaseIoSize** are unsigned integers.

The following table shows some sample conversions when **BaseIoSize** is 8192.

| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable | 512 | 1 |
| Variable | 4096 (4 KB) | 1 |
| Variable | 8192 (8 KB) | 1 |
| Variable | 12288 (12 KB) | 2 |
| Variable | 16384 (16 KB) | 2 |
