# 1 Introduction

Secret Key Transaction Authentication for DNS (TSIG), as specified in [[RFC2845]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90388), provides extensible transaction level authentication for DNS. The Generic Security Service Algorithm for Secret Key Transaction Authentication for DNS (GSS-TSIG), as specified in [[RFC3645]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90440), identifies one possible extension to TSIG based on the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), as specified in [[RFC2743]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90378).

This document specifies an extension to GSS-TSIG.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_message-authentication-code-mac"></a>
**Message Authentication Code (MAC)**: A message authenticator computed through the use of a symmetric key. A [**MAC**](#gt_message-authentication-code-mac) algorithm accepts a secret key and a data buffer, and outputs a [**MAC**](#gt_message-authentication-code-mac). The data and [**MAC**](#gt_message-authentication-code-mac) can then be sent to another party, which can verify the integrity and authenticity of the data by using the same secret key and the same [**MAC**](#gt_message-authentication-code-mac) algorithm.

<a id="gt_security-support-provider-ssp"></a>
**security support provider (SSP)**: A dynamic-link library (DLL) that implements the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) by making one or more security packages available to applications. Each security package provides mappings between an application's SSPI function calls and an actual security model's functions. Security packages support security protocols such as Kerberos authentication and NTLM.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

Secret Key Transaction Authentication for DNS (TSIG), as specified in [[RFC2845]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90388), is an extensible protocol by which DNS messages can be authenticated and validated. The Generic Security Service Algorithm for Secret Key Transaction Authentication for DNS (GSS-TSIG), as specified in [[RFC3645]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90440), defines an algorithm for use with TSIG, which is based on the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface, as specified in [[RFC2743]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90378).

In [RFC3645] section 2.2, GSS-TSIG specifies that the final transaction key (TKEY) response indicating successful negotiation has to be signed. In [RFC2845] section 3.4, TSIG specifies which data is to be digested when generating or verifying the contents of a TSIG record. This protocol extension defines an alternate method of building the digest that is used to sign the last message in the GSS-TSIG TKEY negotiation.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This specification defines an extension to GSS-TSIG, as specified in [[RFC3645]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90440). The relationship of GSS-TSIG to other protocols is not changed by this protocol extension.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

All prerequisites and preconditions applicable to GSS-TSIG, as specified in [[RFC3645]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90440), apply to this protocol extension.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

This protocol extension does not require any initialization that is not already required by GSS-TSIG, as specified in [[RFC3645]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90440).

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

This protocol extension does not change message processing events or sequencing rules of messages defined by GSS-TSIG, as specified in [[RFC3645]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90440), beyond the changes described in the following sections.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>
#### 3.1.5.1 Handling the MAC Field While Digesting DNS Messages

GSS-TSIG, as specified in [[RFC3645]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90440), specifies how the client and server exchange tokens obtained from GSS-API calls (as specified in [[RFC2743]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90378)). The tokens are contained in DNS TKEY records, as specified in [[RFC2930]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90397). In [RFC3645] section 4.1.3, GSS-TSIG specifies that the server MUST sign the final TKEY response in GSS-TSIG negotiation.

In [[RFC2845]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90388) section 3.4.3, TSIG specifies that the request [**message authentication code (MAC)**](#gt_message-authentication-code-mac) is to be included in the digest when generating or validating a DNS message. However, because the final TKEY response in the GSS-TSIG is the first DNS message in the exchange that has been signed, there is no request MAC that can be included when performing the digest operation.

When there is no request MAC, the most obvious interpretation of [RFC2845] section 3.4.3 is that the 2-byte MAC length with a value of zero be included in the digest to indicate that no MAC data bytes are being included in the digest. This protocol extension specifies that when building the digest for this message, the request MAC MUST be completely omitted. In other words, the request MAC length and request MAC data fields MUST NOT be included in the digest, so the only components of the digest will be the DNS response message and TSIG response variables.

After GSS-TSIG negotiation is complete, the digesting of further DNS messages MUST include the request MAC, as specified in [RFC2845] section 3.4.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2"></a>
#### 3.1.5.2 Support for the HDAC-MD5 Algorithm

[[RFC2845]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90388) section 2.2 specifies that TSIG MUST support the "HMAC-MD5" algorithm. GSS-API does not explicitly define the [**MAC**](#gt_message-authentication-code-mac) formats supported. Instead it relies on the [**security support provider (SSP)**](#gt_security-support-provider-ssp) that is exposed by the operating system. Implementations of this protocol extension MUST NOT support the "HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT" algorithm in [RFC2845] section 7. Implementations of this protocol extension MUST support the "gss-tsig" algorithm, as specified in [[RFC3645]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90440) section 3.1.2.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.3"></a>
#### 3.1.5.3 Signing DNS Update Response Messages

As described in [[RFC2136]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=107017) section 3.8, the DNS server MUST send a DNS update response back to the DNS client after processing a DNS update request. If the DNS update request is signed and includes a TSIG record, as specified in [[RFC3645]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90440) and [[RFC2845]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90388) section 4, then the DNS server SHOULD<1> sign the DNS update response and include the resulting TSIG record as described in [RFC3645].

<a id="Section_3.1.5.4"></a>
#### 3.1.5.4 Domain Name Compression

As described in [[RFC1123]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90268) section 6.1.2.4, name servers MUST use compression in responses. For the TSIG resource record in DNS response messages, compression is not supported.

<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>
### 3.1.6 Timer Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.7"></a>
### 3.1.7 Other Local Events

None.

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 3.1.5.3: In the Windows implementation of the DNS server, the DNS client will find that the DNS server signed a DNS update response, as described in [[RFC3645]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90440), only if the RCODE value in the response message is zero (indicating success).

If the RCODE value in the DNS update response message is not zero (indicating failure), the DNS client will find that the DNS server did not sign the response. Instead, the DNS server copied the DNS update request message, changed the RCODE value to the applicable nonzero error value, and sent that message back to the DNS client as the response. The message was otherwise unmodified; that is, the response message contains the same signature that was in the request message.
