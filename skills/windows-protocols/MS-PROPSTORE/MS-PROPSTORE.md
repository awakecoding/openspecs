# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Microsoft Property Store Binary File Format. This file format is a persistence format for a set of properties. Implementers can use this file format to store a set of properties in a file or within another structure.

Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_little-endian"></a>
**little-endian**: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the least significant byte stored in the memory location with the lowest address.

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world. The [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) standard [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16 BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.2"></a>
## 1.2 References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the [Errata](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=850906).

<a id="Section_1.2.2"></a>
### 1.2.2 Informative References

None.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

This structure provides a compact way to serialize one or more property sets. Each property set consists of a property set identifier and one or more property values. Each property value consists of a unique property name and an associated value. Each property name can be either an unsigned integer or, in the case of a special property set identifier, a [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) string.

This structure does not specify the semantics of properties or the assignment of property set identifiers or property names.

Data in this file format is stored in [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) format.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Protocols and Other Structures

This structure is used by the Shell Link (.LNK) Binary File Format, as specified in [MS-SHLLINK](../MS-SHLLINK/MS-SHLLINK.md).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Applicability Statement

This document specifies a persistence format for one or more sets of property identifiers and associated property values. This persistence format is applicable when each property set can be identified by a [**globally unique identifier (GUID)**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid), and when each property within a property set can be identified by an unsigned integer or a [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) string name and can be persisted as a TypedPropertyValue structure, as specified in [MS-OLEPS](#Section_2) section 2.15.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Versioning and Localization

None.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Vendor-Extensible Fields

Implementers are free to define new **Format ID**s within the [Serialized Property Storage](#Section_2.2) structure, as defined in section 2.2, and to define new property identifiers within a [Serialized Property Value](#Section_2.3) structure, as defined in section 2.3.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Structures

This document references commonly used data types as defined in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md).

Unless otherwise qualified, instances of **GUID** in this section refer to [MS-DTYP] section 2.3.4.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Serialized Property Store

The Property Store Binary File Format is a sequence of [Serialized Property Storage](#Section_2.2) structures. The sequence MUST be terminated by a Serialized Property Storage structure that specifies 0x00000000 for the **Storage Size** field.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-31: "Store Size"
  32-95: "Serialized Property Storage (variable)"
```

**Store Size (4 bytes):** An unsigned integer that specifies the total size, in bytes, of this structure, excluding the size of this field.

**Serialized Property Storage (variable):** A sequence of one or more Serialized Property Storage structures, as specified in section 2.2.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "Serialized Property Storage - 1"
  64-95: "Serialized Property Storage - N"
  96-127: "Serialized Property Storage with Storage Size value of 0x00000000"
```

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Serialized Property Storage

The Serialized Property Storage structure is a sequence of [Serialized Property Value](#Section_2.3) structures. The sequence MUST be terminated by a Serialized Property Value structure that specifies 0x00000000 for the **Value Size** field.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-31: "Storage Size"
  32-63: "Version"
  64-191: "Format ID"
  192-255: "Serialized Property Value (variable)"
```

**Storage Size (4 bytes):** An unsigned integer that specifies the total size, in bytes, of this structure. It MUST be 0x00000000 if this is the last Serialized Property Storage in the enclosing [Serialized Property Store](#Section_2.1).

**Version (4 bytes):** Has to be equal to 0x53505331.

**Format ID (16 bytes):** A [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) that specifies the semantics and expected usage of the properties contained in this Serialized Property Storage structure. It MUST be unique in the set of serialized property storage structures.

**Serialized Property Value (variable):** A sequence of one or more property values. If the **Format ID** field is equal to the GUID {D5CDD505-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}, then all values in the sequence MUST be [Serialized Property Value (String Name)](#Section_2.3.1) structures, as specified in section 2.3.1; otherwise, all values MUST be [Serialized Property Value (Integer Name)](#Section_2.3.2) structures, as specified in section 2.3.2. The last Serialized Property Value in the sequence MUST specify 0x00000 for the **Value Size**.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "Serialized Property Value - 1"
  64-95: "Serialized Property Value - N"
  96-127: "Serialized Property Value with Value Size of 0x00000000"
```

<a id="Section_2.3"></a>
## 2.3 Serialized Property Value

There are two types of Serialized Property Value structures: [Serialized Property Value (String Name)](#Section_2.3.1) structures and [Serialized Property Value (Integer Name)](#Section_2.3.2) structures.

<a id="Section_2.3.1"></a>
### 2.3.1 Serialized Property Value (String Name)

The Serialized Property Value (String Name) structure specifies a single property within a [Serialized Property Storage](#Section_2.2) structure, where the property is identified by a unique [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) string.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-31: "Value Size"
  32-63: "Name Size"
  64-71: "Reserved"
  72-127: "Name (variable)"
  128-191: "Value (variable)"
```

**Value Size (4 bytes):** An unsigned integer that specifies the total size, in bytes, of this structure. It MUST be 0x00000000 if this is the last The Serialized Property Value in the enclosing Serialized Property Storage structure.

**Name Size (4 bytes):** An unsigned integer that specifies the size, in bytes, of the **Name** field, including the null-terminating character.

**Reserved (1 byte):** Has to be 0x00.

**Name (variable):** A null-terminated Unicode string that specifies the identity of the property. It has to be unique within the enclosing Serialized Property Storage structure.

**Value (variable):** A TypedPropertyValue structure, as specified in [MS-OLEPS](#Section_2) section 2.15.

<a id="Section_2.3.2"></a>
### 2.3.2 Serialized Property Value (Integer Name)

The Serialized Property Value (Integer Name) structure specifies a single property within a [Serialized Property Storage](#Section_2.2) structure, where the property is identified by a unique unsigned integer.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-31: "Value Size"
  32-63: "Id"
  64-71: "Reserved"
  72-127: "Value (variable)"
```

**Value Size (4 bytes):** An unsigned integer that specifies the total size, in bytes, of this structure. It MUST be 0x00000000 if this is the last Serialized Property Value in the enclosing Serialized Property Storage structure.

**Id (4 bytes):** An unsigned integer that specifies the identity of the property. It MUST be unique within the enclosing Serialized Property Storage structure.

**Reserved (1 byte):** MUST be 0x00.

**Value (variable):** A TypedPropertyValue structure, as specified in [MS-OLEPS](#Section_2) section 2.15.
