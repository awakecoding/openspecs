# 1 Introduction

[**Enhanced metafile spool format (EMFSPOOL)**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) is a file format used to store portable definitions of [**print jobs**](#gt_print-job) that output graphical images. EMFSPOOL [**metafiles**](#gt_metafile) contain a sequence of records that are parsed and processed to run the print job on any output device.

Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_american-national-standards-institute-ansi-character-set"></a>
**American National Standards Institute (ANSI) character set**: A character set defined by a code page approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The term "ANSI" as used to signify Windows code pages is a historical reference and a misnomer that persists in the Windows community. The source of this misnomer stems from the fact that the Windows code page 1252 was originally based on an ANSI draft, which became International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 8859-1 [[ISO/IEC-8859-1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90689). In Windows, the ANSI character set can be any of the following code pages: 1252, 1250, 1251, 1253, 1254, 1255, 1256, 1257, 1258, 874, 932, 936, 949, or 950. For example, "ANSI application" is usually a reference to a non-[**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) or code-page-based application. Therefore, "ANSI character set" is often misused to refer to one of the character sets defined by a Windows code page that can be used as an active system code page; for example, character sets defined by code page 1252 or character sets defined by code page 950. Windows is now based on Unicode, so the use of ANSI character sets is strongly discouraged unless they are used to interoperate with legacy applications or legacy data.

<a id="gt_ascii"></a>
**ASCII**: The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is an 8-bit character-encoding scheme based on the English alphabet. ASCII codes represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other devices that work with text. ASCII refers to a single 8-bit ASCII character or an array of 8-bit ASCII characters with the high bit of each character set to zero.

<a id="gt_big-endian"></a>
**big-endian**: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the most significant byte stored in the memory location with the lowest address.

<a id="gt_bitmap"></a>
**bitmap**: A collection of structures that contain a representation of a graphical image, a logical palette, dimensions and other information.

<a id="gt_color-matching"></a>
**color matching**: The conversion of a color, sent from its original color space, to its visually closest color in the destination color space. See also [**Image Color Management (ICM)**](#gt_image-color-management-icm).

<a id="gt_delta-font"></a>
**delta font**: Partial [**TrueType**](#gt_truetype) and [**OpenType**](#gt_opentype) font that contains new [**glyphs**](#gt_glyph) to be merged with data from a previous [**subset font**](#gt_subset-font) definition.

<a id="gt_design-vector"></a>
**design vector**: A set of specific values for the font axes of a multiple master font.

<a id="gt_device"></a>
**device**: Any peripheral or part of a computer system that can send or receive data.

**dithering**: A form of digital halftoning.

<a id="gt_embedded-font"></a>
**embedded font**: A font that is attached to a document so that the font can be used wherever the document is used, regardless of whether the font is installed on the system.

<a id="gt_encapsulated-postscript-eps"></a>
**encapsulated PostScript (EPS)**: A file of [**PostScript**](#gt_postscript) raw data that describes the appearance of a single page. Although EPS data can describe text, graphics, and images; the primary purpose of an EPS file is to be encapsulated within another [**PostScript**](#gt_postscript) page definition.

<a id="gt_enhanced-metafile-format-emf"></a>
**enhanced metafile format (EMF)**: A file format that supports the device-independent definitions of images.

<a id="gt_enhanced-metafile-format-plus-extensions-emf"></a>
**enhanced metafile format plus extensions (EMF+)**: A file format that supports the device-independent definitions of images.

<a id="gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool"></a>
**enhanced metafile spool format (EMFSPOOL)**: A format that specifies a structure of [**enhanced metafile format (EMF)**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-format-emf) records used for defining application and device-independent printer [**spool files**](#gt_spool-file).

<a id="gt_font-association"></a>
**font association**: The automatic pairing of a font that contains ideographs with a font that does not contain ideographs. Font association is used to maintain font attributes across changes in locale and allows the user to enter ideographic characters regardless of which font is selected.

<a id="gt_font-axis"></a>
**font axis**: A property of font design that can assume a linear range of values. In general, a font has multiple axes. For example, a font can define an axis for [**weight**](#gt_weight), along which range the possible values for that property.

<a id="gt_font-mapper"></a>
**font mapper**: An operating system component that maps specified font attributes to available, installed fonts on the system.

<a id="gt_glyph"></a>
**glyph**: A graphical representation of a character, a part of a character, or a sequence of characters, in a font used for graphical output.

<a id="gt_graphics-device-interface-gdi"></a>

<a id="gt_inclusive-inclusive"></a>
**inclusive-inclusive**: When referring to the bounds of a rectangle that consist of two coordinates—one coordinate for one corner and the other coordinate for the opposite corner [**inclusive-inclusive**](#gt_inclusive-inclusive) means that the coordinates are part of the rectangle. If not [**inclusive-inclusive**](#gt_inclusive-inclusive), the coordinates are not part of the rectangle and instead are one logical unit outside the bounds of the rectangle along both coordinate axes.

<a id="gt_little-endian"></a>
**little-endian**: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the least significant byte stored in the memory location with the lowest address.

<a id="gt_metafile"></a>
**metafile**: A sequence of record structures that store an image in an application-independent format. Metafile records contain drawing commands, object definitions, and configuration settings. When a metafile is processed, the stored image can be rendered on a display, output to a printer or plotter, stored in memory, or saved to a file or stream.

<a id="gt_opengl"></a>
**OpenGL**: A software API for graphics hardware that supports the rendering of multidimensional graphical objects. The Microsoft implementation of OpenGL for the Windows operating system provides industry-standard graphics software for creating high-quality still and animated three-dimensional color images. See [[OPENGL]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90241) for further information.

<a id="gt_opentype"></a>
**OpenType**: A [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode)-based font technology that is an extension to [**TrueType**](#gt_truetype) and [**Type 1 font**](#gt_type-1-font) technologies. OpenType allows [**PostScript**](#gt_postscript) and [**TrueType**](#gt_truetype) glyph definitions to reside in a common container format.

<a id="gt_page-description-language-pdl"></a>
**page description language (PDL)**: The language for describing the layout and contents of a printed page. Common examples are PostScript and Printer Control Language (PCL).

<a id="gt_port"></a>
**port**: A TCP/IP numbered connection point that is used to transfer data.

<a id="gt_postscript"></a>
**PostScript**: A [**page description language**](#gt_page-description-language-pdl) developed by Adobe Systems that is primarily used for printing documents on laser printers. It is the standard for desktop publishing.

<a id="gt_print-job"></a>
**print job**: The rendered [**page description language (PDL)**](#gt_page-description-language-pdl) output data sent to a print device for a particular application or user request.

<a id="gt_print-server"></a>
**print server**: A machine that hosts the print system and all its different components.

<a id="gt_printer-driver"></a>
**printer driver**: The interface component between the operating system and the printer device. It is responsible for processing the application data into a [**page description language (PDL)**](#gt_page-description-language-pdl) that can be interpreted by the printer device.

<a id="gt_region"></a>
**region**: A graphics object that is nonrectilinear in shape and is defined by an array of scanlines.

<a id="gt_soft-font"></a>
**soft font**: A font that is downloaded from an external source, such as a disk or system, to a printer prior to printing.

<a id="gt_spool-file"></a>
**spool file**: A representation of application content data than can be processed by a [**printer driver**](#gt_printer-driver). Common examples are enhanced metafile format and XML Paper Specification (XPS) [[MSDN-XMLP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90172). For more information, see [[MSDN-META]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90040).

<a id="gt_spool-file-format"></a>
**spool file format**: The specific representation that is used in an instance of a [**spool file**](#gt_spool-file). Common examples for [**spool file**](#gt_spool-file) formats are [**enhanced metafile spool format (EMFSPOOL)**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) [MS-EMFSPOOL](#Section_3d8cd6cc528742e8925f4a53afd04534) and XML Paper Specification (XPS) [MSDN-XMLP]. For more information, see [[MSDN-SPOOL]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90134).

<a id="gt_stock-object"></a>
**stock object**: A predefined graphics object. Stock objects are standard, commonly used objects, such as a black brush and pen. The set of predefined stock objects is specified in [MS-EMF] section 2.1.31. Stock objects are neither created nor deleted.

<a id="gt_subset-font"></a>
**subset font**: A subset of [**TrueType**](#gt_truetype) and [**OpenType**](#gt_opentype) fonts, which can be merged to form more complete fonts. Subset fonts are embedded in [**metafiles**](#gt_metafile) in order to save space. Information is present only for the characters that are actually used in a document.

<a id="gt_truetype"></a>
**TrueType**: A scalable font technology that renders fonts for both the printer and the screen. Each TrueType font contains its own algorithms for converting printer outlines into screen [**bitmaps**](#gt_bitmap), which means both the outline and [**bitmap**](#gt_bitmap) information is rasterized from the same font data. The lower-level language embedded within the TrueType font allows great flexibility in its design. Both TrueType and [**Type 1 font**](#gt_type-1-font) technologies are part of the [**OpenType**](#gt_opentype) format.

<a id="gt_truetype-font"></a>

<a id="gt_typeface"></a>
**typeface**: The primary design of a set of printed characters such as Courier, Helvetica, and Times Roman. The terms typeface and font are sometimes used interchangeably. A font is the particular implementation and variation of the typeface such as normal, bold, or italics. The distinguishing characteristic of a typeface is often the presence or absence of serifs.

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world. The [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) standard [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16 BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

<a id="gt_utf-16le"></a>
**UTF-16LE**: The Unicode Transformation Format - 16-bit, Little Endian encoding scheme. It is used to encode [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) characters as a sequence of 16-bit codes, each encoded as two 8-bit bytes with the least-significant byte first.

<a id="gt_weight"></a>
**weight**: The property of a font that specifies the degree of emphasis or boldness of the characters.

<a id="gt_windows-metafile-format-wmf"></a>

## 1.3 Overview

An [**EMFSPOOL**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) [**metafile**](#gt_metafile) is a sequence of variable-length records that define the page data, page layout, fonts, graphics, and virtual device settings for a [**print job**](#gt_print-job) that renders a graphical image.<1>

<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 Metafile Structure

An [**EMFSPOOL**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) [**metafile**](#gt_metafile) begins with a header record, which includes the metafile version, its size, the name of the document, and identification of an output device. A metafile is "played back" when its records are parsed and processed, sends the [**print job**](#gt_print-job) to its next destination

EMFSPOOL records contain graphics commands, which specify drawing operations, graphics objects, and properties that define how to render the document, including:

- The overall structure of the document.
- The format and content of individual pages.
- Print [**device**](#gt_device) settings, such as paper size.
- [**Embedded fonts**](#gt_embedded-font).
- Image [**bitmaps**](#gt_bitmap).
- Injected [**PostScript**](#gt_postscript) commands.

Figure 1: High-level structure of an EMFSPOOL file

This figure shows the following about EMFSPOOL files:

- A header record is always present, specified in section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2).
- A page content record actually contains an entire [**EMF**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-format-emf) metafile, as specified in [MS-EMF](../MS-EMF/MS-EMF.md).
- A font definition can be embedded in an EMF EMR_COMMENT_EMFSPOOL record, which is embedded in an EMF metafile, which is embedded in a page content record. For more information, see [MS-EMF] section 2.3.3.3.
- No end-of-file record is defined.
<a id="Section_1.3.2"></a>
### 1.3.2 Byte Ordering

The bytes in a word in [**EMFSPOOL**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) [**metafile**](#gt_metafile) records are numbered right-to-left [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) format.

Some computer architectures number the bytes in a word from left to right, which is called [**big-endian**](#gt_big-endian). The byte numbering used for bitfields in this specification is big-endian. Other architectures number the bytes in a binary word from right to left, which is referred to as little-endian. The byte numbering used for enumerations, objects, and records in this specification is little-endian.

Using the big-endian and little-endian methods, the number 0x12345678 would be stored as shown in the following table.

| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable | big-endian | 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78 |
| Variable | little-endian | 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12 |

## 1.4 Relationship to Protocols and Other Structures

Several related [**metafile**](#gt_metafile) formats can be used together for device-independent printing. Their relationships are:

- [**Enhanced metafile spool format (EMFSPOOL)**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) records (section [2.2](#Section_2.2)) can contain EMF records.
- [**Enhanced metafile format (EMF)**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-format-emf) records ([MS-EMF](../MS-EMF/MS-EMF.md) section 2.3) can contain EMF+ records.
- [**Enhanced metafile format plus extensions (EMF+)**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-format-plus-extensions-emf) records ([MS-EMFPLUS](../MS-EMFPLUS/MS-EMFPLUS.md) section 2.3) can contain [**Windows metafile format (WMF)**](#gt_windows-metafile-format-wmf) records ([MS-WMF](../MS-WMF/MS-WMF.md) section 2.3).
This is illustrated qualitatively in the following figure.

![Relationships of metafile record types](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: Relationships of metafile record types

EMFSPOOL metafile [**print jobs**](#gt_print-job) are sent to remote [**print servers**](#gt_print-server) by using the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN](../MS-RPRN/MS-RPRN.md) or Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR](../MS-PAR/MS-PAR.md).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Applicability Statement

[**EMFSPOOL**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) [**metafiles**](#gt_metafile) are portable containers for [**print jobs**](#gt_print-job). The [**spool file format**](#gt_spool-file-format) supported by EMFSPOOL is applicable to rendering output on all devices, including displays, printers, and plotters.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Versioning and Localization

This specification covers versioning issues in the following areas:

**Structure Versions**: There is only one version of the [**EMFSPOOL**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) file format.

**Localization**: EMFSPOOL format defines no locale-specific processes or data.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Vendor-Extensible Fields

[**EMFSPOOL**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) [**metafile**](#gt_metafile) format supports arbitrary, vendor-defined [**PDL**](#gt_page-description-language-pdl) within embedded [**EMF**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-format-emf) metafiles [MS-EMF](../MS-EMF/MS-EMF.md).

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Structures

The following topics specify:

- Common enumerations.
- [**EMF spool format**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) records, as they are marshaled on the wire.
This protocol references commonly used data types as defined in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md).

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 EMFSPOOL Records

[**EMFSPOOL**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) records include syntax and record types. This information is organized as follows.

| Name | Section | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Record syntax | [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1) | The structure and syntax of EMFSPOOL records. |
| Header record | [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2) | The EMFSPOOL header record, which specifies global properties, including the size of the spool file, the name of the document being spooled, and the name of the output device. |
| Data records | [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3) | EMFSPOOL data records, which specify page content, fonts, and output device information. |

All string data in EMFSPOOL records MUST be encoded in [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) [**UTF-16LE**](#gt_utf-16le) format, as specified in [[UNICODE]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90550), unless stated otherwise. The size of each record in EMFSPOOL MUST be rounded up to a multiple of 4 bytes.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Record Syntax

The **Record Syntax** is specified as follows.

<emf_spool_format> ::= <Header_record>

[ <EMRI_PS_JOB_DATA_record> ]

{ <other_records> }

<page_offset_records>

<other_records> ::= <page_content_records> |

<font_definition_records> |

<font_offset_records> |

<EMRI_DEVMODE_record> |

<EMRI_PRESTARTPAGE_record>

<page_content_records> ::= <EMRI_METAFILE_record> |

<EMRI_FORM_METAFILE_record> |

<EMRI_BW_METAFILE_record> |

<EMRI_BW_FORM_METAFILE_record> |

<EMRI_METAFILE_DATA_record>

<page_offset_records> ::= <EMRI_METAFILE_EXT_record> |

<EMRI_BW_METAFILE_EXT_record>

<font_definition_records> ::= <EMRI_ENGINE_FONT_record> |

<EMRI_TYPE1_FONT_record> |

<EMRI_DESIGNVECTOR_record> |

<EMRI_SUBSET_FONT_record> |

<EMRI_DELTA_FONT_record>

<font_offset_records> ::= <EMRI_ENGINE_FONT_EXT_record> |

<EMRI_TYPE1_FONT_EXT_record> |

<EMRI_DESIGNVECTOR_EXT_record> |

<EMRI_SUBSET_FONT_OFFSET_record> |

<EMRI_DELTA_FONT_EXT_record> |

<EMRI_EMBED_FONT_EXT_record>

These record types perform the following roles:

- An **<EMRI_PS_JOB_DATA_record>** stores injected [**PostScript**](#gt_postscript) code at the document level. If an <EMRI_PS_JOB_DATA_record> is present in the [**metafile**](#gt_metafile), it MUST be the first [**EMF spool format**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) record after the <Header_record>.
- **<page_content_records>** store drawing commands for rendering and formatting individual pages of output. Within a <page_content_record>, a complete [**EMF**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-format-emf) metafile can be defined, as specified in [MS-EMF](../MS-EMF/MS-EMF.md).
- **<page_offset_records>** point to <page_content_records>, which MUST precede the <page_offset_records> in the metafile. Two types of <page_offset_records> are provided, for color and monochrome pages.
- **<font_definition_records>** store font information within an EMF EMR_COMMENT_EMFSPOOL record that is identified with the signature "TONF", as specified in [MS-EMF] section 2.3.3.3. The EMR_COMMENT_EMFSPOOL record is part of an EMF metafile that is embedded in a <page_content_record>.
- **<font_offset_records>** point to the [**embedded font**](#gt_embedded-font) definitions within preceding <page_content_records>.
- An **<EMRI_DEVMODE_record>** stores [**device**](#gt_device) settings and information about device capabilities.
- An **<EMRI_PRESTARTPAGE_record>** stores [**encapsulated PostScript (EPS)**](#gt_encapsulated-postscript-eps).
All record types are specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2).

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 Header Record

The Header record is always the first record of an [**EMFSPOOL**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) [**metafile**](#gt_metafile).

packet-beta
  0-31: "dwVersion"
  32-63: "cjSize"
  64-95: "dpszDocName"
  96-127: "dpszOutput"
  128-223: "extraDataDocName (variable)"
  224-319: "extraDataOutputDevice (variable)"
```

**cjSize (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the size, in bytes, of the header record, including extra data attached. The size of each record in EMFSPOOL MUST be rounded up to a multiple of 32 bits.

**dpszDocName (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the offset of the document name from the start of the record (**dwVersion** field). The document name is stored as a NULL-terminated [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) string, as specified in [[UNICODE]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90550), in the **extraDataDocName** field. If this value is 0x00000000, a document name string SHOULD NOT be present in the header record.

**dpszOutput (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the offset of the output [**device**](#gt_device) name from the start of the record (**dwVersion** field). The output device name is stored as a NULL-terminated Unicode string in the **extraDataOutputDevice** field. If this value is 0x00000000, an output device name string SHOULD NOT be present in the header record.

**extraDataDocName (variable):** Variable-size storage area for the document name string. This structure MUST be 32-bit aligned.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-95: "PaddingDocName (variable)"
  96-191: "DocName (variable)"
  192-287: "AlignmentDocName (variable)"
```

**PaddingDocName (variable):** An optional array of WORD structures as padding, because the **DocName** field is not required to immediately follow the **dpszOutput** field. The values of these structures are indeterminate and MUST be ignored.

**DocName (variable):** A null-terminated string that specifies the name of the output file, or the name of the printer port.

**AlignmentDocName (variable):** An optional array of WORD structures to ensure 32-bit alignment. The values of these structures are indeterminate and MUST be ignored.

**extraDataOutputDevice (variable):** Variable-size storage area for the output device name string. This structure MUST be 32-bit aligned.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-95: "PaddingOutputDevice (variable)"
  96-191: "OutputDevice (variable)"
  192-287: "AlignmentOutputDevice (variable)"
```

**PaddingOutputDevice (variable):** An optional array of WORD structures as padding, because the **OutputDevice** field is not required to immediately follow the **extraDataDocName** field. The values of these structures are indeterminate and MUST be ignored.

**OutputDevice (variable):** A null-terminated string that specifies the name of the output file, or the name of the printer port.

**AlignmentOutputDevice (variable):** An optional array of WORD structures to ensure 32-bit alignment. The values of these structures are indeterminate and MUST be ignored.

The **FileEndOffs** values are limited as follows:

FileEndOffs[0] < FileEndOffs[1] < ... < FileEndOffs[NumFiles - 1]

<= (cjSize – (8 + (nFiles * 4))

Each offset value MUST be a multiple of 4 bytes, and each file MUST have a size greater than zero.

# 3 Structure Examples

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Byte Ordering

The following code snippet illustrates how the use of the [**big-endian**](#gt_big-endian) and [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) methods can affect the compatibility of applications.

#include <unistd.h>

#include <sys/stat.h>

#include <fcntl.h>

int main()

{

int buf;

int in;

int nread;

in = open("file.in", O_RDONLY);

nread = read(in, (int *) &buf, sizeof(buf));

printf("First Integer in file.in = %x\n", buf);

exit(0);

}

In the preceding code, if the first integer word stored in the file.in file on a big-endian computer was the hexadecimal number 0x12345678, the resulting output on that computer would be as follows.

% ./test

First Integer in file.in = 12345678

%

If the file.in file were read by the same program running on a little-endian computer, the resulting output would be as follows.

% ./test

First Integer in file.in = 78563412

%

Because of the difference in output, one would need to implement [**metafile**](#gt_metafile) record processing so that it could read integers from a file based on the endian method that the computer uses.

```

**dwVersion (4 bytes):** 0x00010000 specifies the version of [**EMFSPOOL**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool).

**cjSize (4 bytes):** 0x00000054 specifies the size, in bytes, of the header record, including any extra data attached.

**dpszDocName (4 bytes):** 0x00000010 specifies the offset of the document name from the start of the record (the **dwVersion** field). The document name is stored as a NULL-terminated [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) string [[UNICODE]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90550), in the **extraData** area. If the value is 0x00000000, no document name is specified.

**dpszOutput (4 bytes):** 0x00000046 specifies the offset of the output [**device**](#gt_device) name from the start of the record (**dwVersion** field). The output device name is stored as a NULL-terminated Unicode string in the **extraData** area. If the value is 0, no output device name is specified.

**extraDataDocName**: Variable-size storage area for document name.

**extraDataOutputDevice**: Variable-size storage area for output device name. Padding bytes will be added following this storage area to align the entire header record on a 4-byte boundary.

```

**ulID (4 bytes):** 0x0000000C identifies the EMRI_METAFILE_DATA record type ().

**cjSize (4 bytes):** 0x00064658 specifies the 4-byte-aligned size in bytes of the data in this record.

**EmfMetafile (variable):** A variable-size field that contains a complete [**EMF**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-format-emf) [**metafile**](#gt_metafile). This embedded metafile itself contains an embedded Font Definition Record (), the corresponding example of which is in section [3.2.2.20.1](#Section_3.2.2.20.1).

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.3: When a Windows application needs to print, it performs the following operations:

- First, the application creates a printer [**device**](#gt_device) context specifying the target printer.
- The application then calls [**Windows graphics device interface (GDI)**](#gt_6c550e84-9a9c-46ef-8716-7260fe29cae3) methods such as **DrawLine** to pass drawing instructions to the GDI graphics engine.
- The GDI graphics engine accumulates the drawing instructions into an [**EMFSPOOL**](#gt_enhanced-metafile-spool-format-emfspool) file.
- The [**spool file**](#gt_spool-file) is sent to the Windows print spooler. One of the spool file formats accepted by the Windows print spooler is the EMFSPOOL.
- The Windows print spooler interprets the EMFSPOOL, possibly also inserting page layout information and job control instructions into the data stream.
- The spooler then sends the data stream to the serial, parallel, or network [**port**](#gt_port) driver associated with the target printer's I/O port.
