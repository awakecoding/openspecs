# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Host Guardian Services Attestation (HGSA) Protocol.

Host Guardian Service provides secure services such as Attestation Service and Key Protection Service. Together these two services provide security assurance for shielded VMs by ensuring that shielded VMs can be run only on known and trusted fabric hosts that have a legitimate configuration. Key Protection Service is out of scope of the document.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_ek-public-key-ekpub"></a>
**EK public key (EKPub)**: The public key portion of an endorsement key's private/public key pair.

<a id="gt_endorsement-key"></a>
**endorsement key**: A Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) public and private key pair that is created randomly on the [**trusted platform module (TPM)**](#gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm) at manufacture time and cannot be changed. The private key never leaves the TPM, while the public key is used for attestation and for encryption of sensitive data sent to the TPM. See [[TCG-Cred]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301945) section 2.4 for more information.

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http"></a>
**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: An application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the World Wide Web.

<a id="gt_pkcs7"></a>
**PKCS7**: A public key cryptography standard used to sign and/or encrypt messages under a public key infrastructure as defined in [[RFC2315]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90334). It is also used for certificate dissemination.

<a id="gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm"></a>
**trusted platform module (TPM)**: A component of a trusted computing platform. The TPM stores keys, passwords, and digital certificates. See [[TCG-Architect]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301944) for more information.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The Host Guardian Service Attestation protocol uses REST-based transport protocol.

The Host Guardian Service provides secure services such as the Attestation Service and the Key Protection Service.

For [**TPM**](#gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm)-based attestation:

- A client initiates TPM-based attestation by providing its Remote TPM public [**endorsement key**](#gt_endorsement-key) ("[**EKPub**](#gt_ek-public-key-ekpub)") to the Host Guardian Service.
- The Host Guardian Service uses the EKPub to initiate an underlying Remote TPM ("RTPM") protocol to the client to read TPM measurements from the client. The reply includes the current RTPM protocol context.
- The client reads the context provided by the service and continues the RTPM protocol by sending another request containing a new RTPM protocol context to the server.
- When the service has completed the TPM read, it compares the measurements therein with the configured TPM-based attestation policy. If policy evaluation succeeds, it returns a valid attestation health certificate to the client.
For Active Directory(AD)-based attestation:

- The server checks that the client credentials are a member of a registered authorized host group.
- A client initiates AD-based attestation by initiating an AD-based attestation request to the Host Guardian Service.
- The service uses the Kerberos protocol to authenticate the client request. If the credentials belong to a configured, authorized Active Directory host group, the service returns a valid attestation health certificate to the client.
For Host Key-based attestation:

- A client initiates Host Key attestation by providing the following to the Host Guardian Service:
- The public portion of a key pair owned by the client, defined as the “Host Key”.
- The public portion of a key pair owned by the client for which the client wishes to receive a health certificate signed by the Host Guardian Service.
- A signature over the above two artifacts using private portion of the “Host Key”.
- The service ensures that the Host Key is recognized, uses the Host Key to validate the provided signature, and issues an attestation health certificate to the client.
The client can choose TPM, AD, or Host Key-based attestation depending upon the server configuration.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

For key protection service, the Host Guardian Service uses Key Protection services, as specified in [MS-KPS](../MS-KPS/MS-KPS.md).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The server is configured to either the [**TPM**](#gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm)-based attestation or AD-based attestation mode and can operate on only one mode at a time.

The following is the list of prerequisites/preconditions to perform TPM-based attestation.

- The client is required to be registered in the server configuration with its [**EKPub**](#gt_ek-public-key-ekpub).
Following is the prerequisite/precondition needed to perform AD-based attestation.

- The Security Identifier of the client is required to be registered in the server configuration.
Following is the prerequisite/precondition needed to perform HostKey-based attestation.<1>

- The client is required to be registered in the server configuration with the public portion of its Host Key.
<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

###### 3.1.5.1.1.3 Processing Details

If the **AttestationOperatingMode** on the server is TPM and received URI terminate with "/domainattest” or “/hostkeyattest”, the server MUST return **OperationModeErrorReply** to the client.

If the **AttestationOperatingMode** on the server is TPM, the received URI terminate with "/attest" but the request received is not valid for TPM mode, the server MUST return **PayloadErrorReply** to the client.

If the request received is **TpmRequestInitial**, the server MUST perform the following:

- Check if a matching entry is found between registered [**EKPub**](#gt_ek-public-key-ekpub) modules and the EKPub of the client that initiated the request.
- If a matching entry is not found, set **isauthorized** to FALSE and return an **UnauthorizedErrorReply** message to the client.
If a matching entry is found, set **isauthorized** to TRUE and construct a **TpmReplyContinue** message in an implementation-specific manner to the client’s **RtpmPublicEndorsementKey**.

If the request received is **TpmRequestContinue** or **AttestationRequest** from the client, the server MUST process the following:

- Check if a matching entry is found between registered EKPub modules and the EKPub of the client. Update **isauthorized** to TRUE if a matching entry is found.
- If **isauthorized** is FALSE for **RtpmPublicEndorsementKey** received from client, return **UnauthorizedErrorReply** to the client.
- If **isauthorized** is TRUE and **RtpmNewContext** received from the client is empty, return **TpmReplyContinue** message to the client with the empty context.
Otherwise,

The client MUST send EndorsementKeyCertificate in AttestationProvidedContentType of **TpmInitialRequest** to server.

If the client validation is successful on the server, the client receives the **TpmReplyContinue** message as part of the initial reply from the server.

If the response received is **TpmReplyContinue**, the client MUST invoke the underlying RTPM protocol to read [**TPM**](#gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm) measurements and update the **RtpmActiveContext** in an implementation-specific manner. The client MUST construct a new **TpmRequestContinue** message and send it via an [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http) POST message to the server. The **AttestationProvidedContentType** for the **TpmRequestContinue** message MUST contain the following.

- **SessionId**.
- **RtpmPublicEndorsementKey (0x4)**.
- Updated **RtpmActiveContext (0x2)**.
If the type of response is **ErrorReply**, the client MUST process as specified in section [3.2.5.4](#Section_3.2.5.4)

If the type of response is **HealthCertificateReply**, the client MUST send the successful attestation to the calling application.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2"></a>
#### 3.2.5.2 Active Directory Based Attestation

The **SecurityIdentifier** of the client is validated against clients in **SecureClientList** that are known to be secure.

If the **SecurityIdentifier** is not valid, the client is not issued with **AttestationHealthCertificate** by the server.

The client MUST initiate Active Directory–based attestation by sending **ADRequest** to the server upon successful validation of **SecurityIdentifier**.

If the response received is **ErrorReply**, the client MUST process as specified in section [3.2.5.4](#Section_3.2.5.4).

If the response received is **HealthCertificateReply**, the client is successfully authenticated and allowed to use the resources of the server.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.3"></a>
#### 3.2.5.3 Host Key Based Attestation

The client MUST provide the following **AttestationProvidedContentType** with the AttestationRequest to the server.

- HostKeyPublicKey (0x8)
- HostKeySignature (0x9)
If the response received is **ErrorReply**, the client MUST process as specified in section [3.2.5.4](#Section_3.2.5.4).

If the response received is **HealthCertificateReply**, the client is successfully authenticated and allowed to use the resources of the server.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.4"></a>
#### 3.2.5.4 Receiving Error Reply

If **ErrorReply** received is and **Retryable** flag is set, the client MAY retry performing attestation.

If **AttemptedOperationMode** in client is not equal to the **ExpectedOperationMode** received in **OperationModeErrorReply,** the client performs the following:

- The client MUST update **AttemptedOperationMode** with the mode of operation received from the server.
- If the **ExpectedOperationMode** received is [**TPM**](#gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm) and client supports TPM 2.0, and the **Retryable** flag is set, client MAY retry performing attestation by sending the subsequent **TpmRequestInitial** or **AttestationRequest** to “/attest” endpoint.
- If the **ExpectedOperationMode** received is AD and the **Retryable** flag is set, client MAY retry performing attestation by sending the subsequent **ADRequest** to “/domainattest” endpoint.
- If the **ExpectedOperationMode** received is HostKey and the **Retryable** flag is set, client MAY retry performing attestation by sending the subsequent **AttestationRequest** to “/hostkeyattest” endpoint.
If the client receives **PolicyEvaluationErrorReply**, the client performs the following:

- The client receives **EvaluationLog** from the server indicating failure in attestation. If the **Retryable** flag is set, the client MAY retry performing attestation based on the **Reason** in **EvaluationLog**.
- If the client received **UnauthorizedErrorReply,** it indicates that the client is not authorized to receive an **AttestationHealthCertificate**.
