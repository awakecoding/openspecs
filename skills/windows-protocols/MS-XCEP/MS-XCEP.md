# 1 Introduction

This protocol specification describes the X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy Protocol, a protocol between a requesting client and a responding server for the exchange of a [**certificate enrollment policy**](#gt_certificate-enrollment-policy).

The communication is initiated by a requesting client that requests either the full certificate enrollment policy, or a subset, by passing in a filter. A server processes the identity of the client and an optionally provided client filter, and generates a response with a collection of certificate enrollment policy objects accompanied by a collection of [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) issuers. The returned certificate issuers provide X509v3 Security Token issuance using [MS-WSTEP](#Section_3.1.4.1.3.12).

The X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy Protocol is a minimal messaging protocol that includes a single client request message (GetPolicies) with a matching server response message (GetPoliciesResponse). The server can alternatively respond with a [**SOAP fault**](#gt_soap-fault) message.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_abstract-syntax-notation-one-asn1"></a>
**Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)**: A notation to define complex data types to carry a message, without concern for their binary representation, across a network. ASN.1 defines an encoding to specify the data types with a notation that does not necessarily determine the representation of each value. ASN.1 encoding rules are sets of rules used to transform data that is specified in the ASN.1 language into a standard format that can be decoded on any system that has a decoder based on the same set of rules. ASN.1 and its encoding rules were once part of the same standard. They have since been separated, but it is still common for the terms ASN.1 and Basic Encoding Rules (BER) to be used to mean the same thing, though this is not the case. Different encoding rules can be applied to a given ASN.1 definition. The choice of encoding rules used is an option of the protocol designer. ASN.1 is described in the following specifications: [[ITUX660]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89922) for general procedures; [[ITUX680]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89923) for syntax specification; [[ITUX690]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89924) for the Basic Encoding Rules (BER), Canonical Encoding Rules (CER), and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoding rules; and [[ITUX691]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=192078) for the Packed Encoding Rules (PER). Further background information on ASN.1 is also available in [DUBUISSON].

<a id="gt_certificate"></a>
**certificate**: When referring to X.509v3 certificates, that information consists of a public key, a distinguished name (DN) of some entity assumed to have control over the private key corresponding to the [**public key**](#gt_public-key) in the certificate, and some number of other attributes and extensions assumed to relate to the entity thus referenced. Other forms of certificates can bind other pieces of information.

<a id="gt_certificate-enrollment"></a>
**certificate enrollment**: The process of acquiring a digital certificate from a [**certificate authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca), which typically requires an end entity to first makes itself known to the CA (either directly, or through a registration authority). This certificate and its associated [**private key**](#gt_private-key) establish a trusted identity for an entity that is using the [**public key**](#gt_public-key)–based services and applications. Also referred to as simply "enrollment".

<a id="gt_certificate-enrollment-policy"></a>
**certificate enrollment policy**: The collection of [**certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template) and [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) issuers available to the requestor for [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificate enrollment**](#gt_certificate-enrollment).

<a id="gt_certificate-template"></a>
**certificate template**: A list of attributes that define a blueprint for creating an [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificate**](#gt_certificate). It is often referred to in non-Microsoft documentation as a "certificate profile". A [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template) is used to define the content and purpose of a digital certificate, including issuance requirements (certificate policies), implemented [**X.509**](#gt_x509) extensions such as application policies, key usage, or extended key usage as specified in [[X509]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90590), and enrollment permissions. Enrollment permissions define the rules by which a [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) will issue or deny certificate requests. In Windows environments, [**certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template) are stored as objects in the Active Directory and used by Microsoft enterprise [**CAs**](#gt_certification-authority-ca).

<a id="gt_certification-authority-ca"></a>
**certification authority (CA)**: A third party that issues [**public key**](#gt_public-key) certificates. Certificates serve to bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide whether to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust is to be transitive. For more information, see [[RFC3280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90414).

<a id="gt_common-name-cn"></a>
**common name (CN)**: A string attribute of a certificate that is one component of a distinguished name (DN). In Microsoft Enterprise uses, a CN has to be unique within the forest where it is defined and any forests that share trust with the defining forest. The website or email address of the certificate owner is often used as a common name. Client applications often refer to a [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) by the CN of its signing certificate.

<a id="gt_extended-key-usage-eku"></a>
**extended key usage (EKU)**: An [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) extension that indicates one or more purposes for which the [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) can be used.

<a id="gt_object-identifier-oid"></a>
**object identifier (OID)**: In the context of an object server, a 64-bit number that uniquely identifies an object.

<a id="gt_private-key"></a>
**private key**: One of a pair of keys used in public-key cryptography. The private key is kept secret and is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted with the corresponding public key. For an introduction to this concept, see [[CRYPTO]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89841) section 1.8 and [[IEEE1363]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89899) section 3.1.

<a id="gt_public-key"></a>
**public key**: One of a pair of keys used in public-key cryptography. The public key is distributed freely and published as part of a digital certificate. For an introduction to this concept, see [CRYPTO] section 1.8 and [IEEE1363] section 3.1.

<a id="gt_public-key-infrastructure-pki"></a>
**public key infrastructure (PKI)**: The laws, policies, standards, and software that regulate or manipulate certificates and public and private keys. In practice, it is a system of digital certificates, [**certificate authorities (CAs)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca), and other registration authorities that verify and authenticate the validity of each party involved in an electronic transaction. For more information, see [X509] section 6.

<a id="gt_registration-authority-ra"></a>
**registration authority (RA)**: A generic term for a software module, hardware component, or human operator thereof that enables a user or [**public key infrastructure (PKI)**](#gt_public-key-infrastructure-pki) administrator to perform various administration and operational functions as part of the certification or revocation process.

<a id="gt_relative-distinguished-name-rdn"></a>
**relative distinguished name (RDN)**: The name of an object relative to its parent. This is the leftmost attribute-value pair in the distinguished name (DN) of an object. For example, in the DN "cn=Peter Houston, ou=NTDEV, dc=microsoft, dc=com", the [**RDN**](#gt_relative-distinguished-name-rdn) is "cn=Peter Houston". For more information, see [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325).

<a id="gt_security-descriptor-definition-language-sddl"></a>
**Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL)**: The format used to specify a security descriptor as a text string, specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.5.1.

<a id="gt_soap-fault"></a>
**SOAP fault**: A container for error and status information within a SOAP message. See [[SOAP1.2-1/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94664) section 5.4 for more information.

<a id="gt_uniform-resource-identifier-uri"></a>
**Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**: A string that identifies a resource. The URI is an addressing mechanism defined in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax [[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453).

<a id="gt_web-services-description-language-wsdl"></a>
**Web Services Description Language (WSDL)**: An XML format for describing network services as a set of endpoints that operate on messages that contain either document-oriented or procedure-oriented information. The operations and messages are described abstractly and are bound to a concrete network protocol and message format in order to define an endpoint. Related concrete endpoints are combined into abstract endpoints, which describe a network service. WSDL is extensible, which allows the description of endpoints and their messages regardless of the message formats or network protocols that are used.

<a id="gt_x509"></a>
**X.509**: An ITU-T standard for public key infrastructure subsequently adapted by the IETF, as specified in [RFC3280].

<a id="gt_xml"></a>
**XML**: The Extensible Markup Language, as described in [[XML1.0]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90599).

<a id="gt_xml-namespace"></a>
**XML namespace**: A collection of names that is used to identify elements, types, and attributes in XML documents identified in a URI reference [RFC3986]. A combination of XML namespace and local name allows XML documents to use elements, types, and attributes that have the same names but come from different sources. For more information, see [[XMLNS-2ED]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90602).

<a id="gt_xml-schema-xsd"></a>
**XML Schema (XSD)**: A language that defines the elements, attributes, namespaces, and data types for [**XML**](#gt_xml) documents as defined by [[XMLSCHEMA1/2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90607) and [[XMLSCHEMA2/2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90609) standards. An XML schema uses [**XML**](#gt_xml) syntax for its language.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificate enrollment policy**](#gt_certificate-enrollment-policy) defines the properties and characteristics for the [**certificate enrollment**](#gt_certificate-enrollment) process. The set of policies is stored and managed by the [**public key infrastructure (PKI)**](#gt_public-key-infrastructure-pki) administration. The X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy Protocol is used by the caller to retrieve enrollment policies that the PKI administrator has defined for use by the caller. This protocol begins with initialization of the secure tunnel over HTTPS, followed by message exchange (request/response) and subsequent closure of the secure tunnel. This specification does not describe the setup and closure of the HTTPS transport.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The server that implements the X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy Protocol requires the client to be preconfigured with the [**URI**](#gt_uniform-resource-identifier-uri) location of the Web service. Authentication using Kerberos will require a compliant Kerberos client. For information about the data model initialization requirements, see section [3.1.3](#Section_3.1.3).

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy Protocol is recommended for use as part of a managed [**PKI**](#gt_public-key-infrastructure-pki) to provide clients with policy guidance for the [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) life cycle. It is possible to enroll for a certificate (to request and receive one) without knowing the policy information provided by this protocol, and therefore, use of this protocol is optional. However, with the policy information, a client can avoid making requests that would be rejected, and can therefore save time and network bandwidth. If the client is running, for example, an autoenrollment process ([MS-CERSOD](#Section_1.3) sections 2.1.2.2 and 2.1.2.2.2), that process might require this policy information.

Although this protocol associates a specific XML namespace prefix for each XML namespace that is used, the choice of any particular XML namespace prefix is implementation-specific and not significant for interoperability.

# 3 Protocol Details

The client side of this protocol is simply a pass-through. That is, no additional timers or other state is required on the client side of this protocol. Calls made by the higher-layer protocol or application are passed directly to the transport, and the results returned by the transport are passed directly back to the higher-layer protocol or application.

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 IPolicy Server Details

The IPolicy server hosts a message endpoint that receives [GetPolicies (section 3.1.4.1.1.1)](#Section_3.1.4.1.2.1) messages. Once received, the server processes the client request, formulates a response, and sends either a [GetPoliciesResponse (section 3.1.4.1.1.2)](#Section_3.1.4.1.2.2) response message or a [**SOAP fault**](#gt_soap-fault). Once the message has been sent to the client, the server returns to the waiting state.

### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

**CertificateEnrollmentPolicyStore:** A repository where a [**certificate enrollment policy**](#gt_certificate-enrollment-policy) resides. The enrollment policy in the store is the basis for a server's X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy response.

**SupportedLanguages:** A list of language identifiers supported by the server. The set of languages are of type xml:lang and defined in [[RFC3066]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90404).

**DefaultLanguage:** A data element that is used to store the server's default language for localized resources.

**LastUpdateTime:** A data element that specifies the last date and time when the **CertificateEnrollmentPolicyStore** was updated or modified.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The **CertificateEnrollmentPolicyStore** data element MUST be initialized with the available [**certificate enrollment policy**](#gt_certificate-enrollment-policy). The initialization MUST also set the value for the **LastUpdateTime** data element.

A server MUST initialize the **DefaultLanguage** data element with the language identifier that is to be used when responding to requests when a caller has not specified a preferred language, or when the specified preferred language is not available in the set of **SupportedLanguages**.

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

The X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy Protocol does not provide message-level signing or message-level encryption for either [GetPolicies (section 3.1.4.1.1.1)](#Section_3.1.4.1.2.1) request messages or [GetPoliciesResponse (section 3.1.4.1.1.2)](#Section_3.1.4.1.2.2) response messages. Implementers should make use of available transport protection as available in HTTPS to provide security to the client/server interaction.

# 7 Appendix B: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

**Windows Releases**

- Windows 7 operating system
- Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system
- Windows 8 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 operating system
- Windows 8.1 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system
- Windows 10 operating system
- Windows Server 2016 operating system
- Windows Server operating system
- Windows Server 2019 operating system
- Windows Server 2022 operating system
- Windows 11 operating system
- Windows Server 2025 operating system
Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 3.1.4.1.3.15: Applicable Windows Server releases will construct this object based on the types stored in the <msPKI-RA-Application-Policies> attribute as specified in [MS-CRTD](../MS-CRTD/MS-CRTD.md) section 2.23.

- If <msPKI-RA-Application-Policies> has the msPKI-Symmetric-Algorithm type, then the value of the <symmetricAlgorithmOIDReference> element is converted to an [**OID**](#gt_object-identifier-oid) and the reference to this OID is copied from <msPKI-RA-Application-Policies>.
- If the <msPKI-RA-Application-Policies> has the msPKI-Symmetric-Key-Length type, then the value of the <symmetricAlgorithmKeyLength> element is copied from <msPKI-RA-Application-Policies>.
<2> Section 3.1.4.1.3.22: This attribute is not supported by Windows Server 2008 R2.

<3> Section 3.1.4.1.3.22: This attribute is not supported by Windows Server 2008 R2.

<4> Section 3.1.4.1.3.23: Applicable Windows Server releases provide a <nextUpdateHours> value of 8 by default. The value can be configured by an administrator.
