# 1 Introduction

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Multiparty Virtual Channel Extension describes the messages that are exchanged between a remote desktop [**host**](#gt_host) and the [**participants**](#gt_participant) with which it is engaging in multiparty application sharing. Examples include communicating the names of the participants that are sharing the session or the list of applications that are currently shared. Additional messages allow participants to negotiate [**control levels**](#gt_control-level) to give participants control of mouse and keyboard input to a shared desktop.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>

## 1.3 Overview

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting Protocol (as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md)) enables the remote display of desktop and application content. To effectively implement an application-sharing or collaborative solution, additional information is conveyed to keep the [**participants**](#gt_participant) apprised of who else is involved, in addition to which applications or windows are being shared. The Remote Desktop Protocol: Multiparty Virtual Channel Extension defines a set of messages that are used to communicate the information between the participants and to signal the occurrence of significant events.

<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 Messages

<a id="Section_1.3.1.1"></a>
#### 1.3.1.1 Application and Window Filtering

A [**host**](#gt_host) can choose to [**share**](#gt_share) all application windows on a desktop or, instead, limit the sharing to a subset. The process of limiting the sharing to a subset is known as [**filtering**](#gt_filtering). Application filtering is used when the host wants to share the current windows for a specific application in addition to any others subsequently created while the application is being shared. Although the term "application" is operating system specific, it generally denotes all windows created by a certain process as well as all windows related to the original windows by window hierarchy. Window filtering is purely explicit. A window is selected for sharing, and any subsequent windows created by an application have to be manually added to the sharing list. The precise mode of operation depends on a combination of user preference and the features of a [**sharing manager**](#gt_sharing-manager).

The filtering functionality of the Remote Desktop Protocol: Multiparty Virtual Channel Extension makes it highly desirable for a sharing manager to communicate the list of windows and applications that are displayed to better coordinate between participants. Protocol messages are provided to communicate filtering state, application names, and window names to the participants.

For more information, see sections [3.2.5.1](#Section_3.2.5.1) and [3.3.5.1](#Section_3.3.5.1).

<a id="Section_1.3.1.2"></a>
#### 1.3.1.2 Participant Management

Participant management facilities allow the [**sharing manager**](#gt_sharing-manager) to send notifications to all participants when an individual [**participant**](#gt_participant) connects or disconnects from the sharing session or when a participant's [**control level**](#gt_control-level) changes.

For more information, see sections [3.2.5.2](#Section_3.2.5.2) and [3.3.5.2](#Section_3.3.5.2).

<a id="Section_1.3.1.3"></a>
#### 1.3.1.3 Graphics Stream Control

The [**host**](#gt_host) can choose to momentarily suspend or resume desktop sharing. This capability is useful when an event, such as the input of a plain-text password, would reveal sensitive information to all participants. Participants are notified when sharing is suspended, so that they know why they are no longer receiving information, as specified in sections [2.2.5](#Section_2.2.5) and [3.2.5.3](#Section_3.2.5.3).

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Multiparty Virtual Channel Extension is embedded in static virtual channel transport, as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Multiparty Virtual Channel Extension operates only after a static virtual channel transport, as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md) section 3.1.5.2, with the name "encomsp" (encoded as a string of [**ANSI characters**](#gt_ansi-character)) is fully established. If the static virtual channel transport is terminated, no other communication over the Remote Desktop Protocol: Multiparty Virtual Channel Extension occurs.

The client sends a pre-connection PDU prior to establishing a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection, as specified in [MS-RDPEPS](../MS-RDPEPS/MS-RDPEPS.md) section 2.2.1.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Multiparty Virtual Channel Extension is designed to be run within the context of an RDP Virtual Channel established between a client and server. This protocol is applicable when information is being communicated among the [**host**](#gt_host) and the [**participants**](#gt_participant) in a multiparty sharing session.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This protocol does not require any specific versioning and does not provide any versioning mechanism.

By binding to this specific channel, the [**host**](#gt_host) and the [**participant**](#gt_participant) acknowledge that they can process any messages sent on the channel.

The messages exchanged in this protocol are simple notifications that do not require a reply.

Both the host and the participant can add new, optional messages to this protocol, so long as the header format remains the same. Both the host and the participant ignore messages of unknown types.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol uses [**HRESULTs**](#gt_hresult), as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.1. Vendors are free to choose their own values, as long as the C bit (0x20000000) is set, indicating it is a customer code.

This protocol uses Win32 error codes. These values are taken from the Windows error number space specified in [MS-ERREF] section 2.2. Vendors SHOULD reuse those values with their indicated meaning. Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the future.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

No standards have been assigned to this protocol.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

The following sections specify the transport and syntax of Remote Desktop Protocol: Multiparty Virtual Channel Extension messages.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Multiparty Virtual Channel Extension is designed to operate over static virtual channels, as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md) section 3.1.5.2, using the name "encomsp" (encoded as a string of [**ANSI characters**](#gt_ansi-character)).

The RDP layer manages the creation, setup, and data transmission over the virtual channel.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Common Order Header (ORDER_HDR)

The messages, or [**protocol data unit (PDU)**](#gt_protocol-data-unit-pdu), exchanged as part of this protocol MUST start with the Common Order Header (ORDER_HDR), which identifies the type of message contained in the PDU payload and the length of the payload, in bytes. As multiple messages for this protocol can be encapsulated in a single lower-level transport PDU, the Common Order Header allows receivers to calculate the message boundaries.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-15: "Type"
  16-31: "Length"
```

**Type (2 bytes):** A 16-bit, unsigned integer that specifies the type of the PDU that follows the **Length** field.

```

**cchString (2 bytes):** A 16-bit, unsigned integer that specifies the number of [**Unicode characters**](#gt_unicode-character) in the **String** field. The size of each Unicode character is 2 bytes. The value of **cchString** MUST NOT exceed 1,024. If **cchString** is set to 0, then the **String** field MUST NOT be present.

**String (variable):** An array of Unicode characters, equal in length to the value of **cchString** field. The variable-length Unicode string comprises the first n Unicode characters in the **String** field, where n is the lesser of the value of the **cchString** field and the number of characters preceding the first null in the array.

<a id="Section_2.2.3"></a>
### 2.2.3 Application and Window Filtering

<a id="Section_2.2.3.1"></a>
#### 2.2.3.1 Filter-Updated PDU (OD_FILTER_STATE_UPDATED)

The Filter-Updated PDU (OD_FILTER_STATE_UPDATED) is used to inform the [**participants**](#gt_participant) whether application [**filtering**](#gt_filtering) is enabled, as specified in section [3.2.5.1.3](#Section_3.2.5.1.3).

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-31: "HDR"
  32-39: "Flags"
```

**HDR (4 bytes):** The common [**PDU**](#gt_protocol-data-unit-pdu) header (as specified in section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1)). The **Type** field of the common PDU header MUST be set to ODTYPE_FILTER_STATE_UPDATED (0x0001).

**Flags (1 byte):** An 8-bit, unsigned **char** that represents a set of bit flags, in little-endian format, that indicate the state of the filter. A bit is true (or set) if its value is 1. This field MUST be composed of the bitwise OR of one or more of the following values.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| FILTER_ENABLED 0x0001 | The filter is enabled. If this bit is 0 then the filter is disabled. |

<a id="Section_2.2.3.2"></a>
#### 2.2.3.2 Application-Created PDU (OD_APP_CREATED)

The Application-Created PDU (OD_APP_CREATED) is sent by the [**sharing manager**](#gt_sharing-manager) to notify participants of newly created applications or other changes in application information. For more information, see section [3.2.5.1.1](#Section_3.2.5.1.1).

```mermaid

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

This protocol allows a [**host**](#gt_host) to propagate [**participant**](#gt_participant), application, and window lists and any updates to these lists. Updates to applications, windows, and participant lists are communicated to the clients via the same [**PDUs**](#gt_protocol-data-unit-pdu) that are used to announce the creation of these elements. For instance, if an application title changes, the server sends an [Application-Created PDU](#Section_4.1.5) that corresponds to that application.

A client SHOULD maintain application, window, and participant lists. A client MAY instead choose to use the information in participant, application, and window messages only to display notifications or it MAY completely ignore the messages. For instance, if an application does not want to show the participant list to the user, it MAY silently discard [Participant-Created](#Section_4.1.2) and [Participant-Removed](#Section_4.1.3) messages.

A host MUST preserve each participant's current control level and the status on whether or not sharing is currently suspended.

Because the notifications for both created and updated applications use the same messages, clients SHOULD distinguish between the two. A client does this by checking whether it already has a record for the unique ID associated with the PDU.

### 3.1.2 Timers

No timers are used.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

Before messages can be sent, the static virtual channel MUST be established by using the parameters specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

No higher-layer triggered events are used.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Message-Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>
#### 3.1.5.1 Processing the Common PDU Header

The **Type** field (as specified in [Common Order Header (ORDER_HDR) (section 2.2.1)](#Section_2.2.1)) MUST be examined to determine if it corresponds to a known message type. If the type does not correspond to a known message type, the [**PDU**](#gt_protocol-data-unit-pdu) SHOULD be ignored.<7> If the type matches a known type, the processing for the **Length** field (see Common Order Header (ORDER_HDR) (section 2.2.1)) MUST be performed based on the value of the **Type** field, as described in the following table.

| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable | ODTYPE_FILTER_STATE_UPDATED 0x0001 | [Processing a Filter-Updated PDU (section 3.2.5.1.3)](#Section_3.2.5.1.3) |
| Variable | ODTYPE_APP_REMOVED 0x0002 | [Processing an Application-Removed PDU (section 3.2.5.1.2)](#Section_3.2.5.1.2) |

| Variable | ODTYPE_PARTICIPANT_CTRL_CHANGE_RESPONSE 0x000D | [Processing the Change Participant Control Level Response PDU (section 3.2.5.2.3)](#Section_3.2.5.2.3) |

More than one sharing message can be contained in a single virtual channel payload. If more than one message is included, they are concatenated, with each message having its own common message header. When processing a message, the receiver MUST verify that enough network data remains in the virtual channel packet to process a message of the size specified by the **Length** field. The receiver SHOULD disconnect from the sharing session if there is not enough data.<8>

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2"></a>
#### 3.1.5.2 Processing UNICODE_STRING Fields

Some messages in the Remote Desktop Protocol: Multiparty Virtual Channel Extension contain [UNICODE_STRING (section 2.2.2)](#Section_2.2.2) packets. These are variable size fields with the length described by the **cchString** member. Upon receiving a message that contains a nonzero length UNICODE_STRING, the receiver MUST validate the string by doubling the value of the **cchString** field to convert to bytes and then check whether there are sufficient bytes left in the message to account for the presence of the string, plus any additional fields.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.3"></a>
#### 3.1.5.3 Processing Application, Window, and Participant IDs

When an [Application-Created](#Section_4.1.5) message is received, the client SHOULD check its application list to see if it contains a record for the value in the **AppId** field. If no record exists, the client MUST create a record that contains the application ID, the name of the application, and the shared state. If a record with the ID exists in the list, the client MUST replace the information in that record with the information in the message. When an [Application-Removed](#Section_4.1.6) message is received, the client MUST remove the record with the corresponding ID from its list. If no such record exists, the client MUST silently discard the message.

Window messages and [**participant**](#gt_participant) messages SHOULD be handled exactly as described in the preceding paragraph.

Application IDs are also used to identify which applications own which windows. The [**sharing manager**](#gt_sharing-manager) SHOULD send the client an Application-Created PDU before it sends any [Window-Created PDUs](#Section_2.2.3.4) for that application. This allows a client to maintain both a global window list and a list of windows per application. Because windows are tied to applications, a window's life span is limited by the life span of the application to which it is associated. The sharing manager SHOULD send [Window-Removed PDUs](#Section_2.2.3.5) before sending the Application-Removed PDU for the application to which the window corresponds. If the client receives an Application-Removed PDU, it SHOULD remove any window from the window list with an **AppId** that corresponds to the application removed.

#### 3.2.5.1 Application and Window Filtering

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.1"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.1 Processing an Application-Created PDU

The receiver of an [Application-Created PDU (OD_APP_CREATED)](#Section_4.1.5) MUST first validate the common header for consistency (as specified in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1)).

After the header is validated, the receiver MUST validate the **Name** field according to the rules specified in section [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2). If the size of the received [**PDU**](#gt_protocol-data-unit-pdu) extends past the end of the **Name** string, the receiver SHOULD ignore the rest of the PDU (the part that extends past the end of the PDU is reserved for future extensions of the message). If the PDU size is not long enough to contain all the fields in the message, including the variable size **Name** field, the connection SHOULD be terminated.<9><10>

If the receiver wants to use the application and window list facilities of this protocol, it SHOULD process the information according to section [3.1.5.3](#Section_3.1.5.3).

<1> Section 2.2.3.2: Windows sets the application identifier to the application's system process ID.

<2> Section 2.2.3.2: In the Windows implementation, the process name is used as the name for an application.

<3> Section 2.2.3.4: In the Windows implementation, the window handle value, which uniquely identifies a window within the Windows operating system, is used as the **WndId**.

<4> Section 2.2.3.4: In the Windows implementation, the window title is used as the window name.

<5> Section 2.2.3.7: In Windows implementations, the sharing manager does not send the Window Region Update PDU (OD_WND_REGION_UPDATE).

<6> Section 2.2.4.1: In Windows implementations, the **GroupId** field is set to 0 by the sharing manager.

<7> Section 3.1.5.1: In Windows implementations, [**PDUs**](#gt_protocol-data-unit-pdu) that have an unknown type in the order header are ignored by the receivers.

<8> Section 3.1.5.1: Windows implementations disconnect the client whenever the header length field is not consistent with the length required for a particular message or with the length of the buffer received from the lower-layer protocol.

<9> Section 3.2.5.1.1: In Windows implementations, if more data is received for a message than the receiver can parse, the receiver parses only the portion of the data that it is able to parse and ignores the rest. For every type of message, the size of the received data is verified to make sure that the message is large enough to contain all the fields for that particular message. If this is not the case, the connection is terminated.

<10> Section 3.2.5.1.1: In Windows implementations, the Name field is optional. If the Name field is not sent then the connection is not terminated.

<11> Section 3.2.5.1.2: In Windows implementations, if more data is received for a message than the receiver can parse, the receiver parses only the portion of the data that it is able to parse and ignores the rest. For every type of message, the size of the received data is verified to make sure that the message is large enough to contain all the fields for that particular message. If this is not the case, the connection is terminated.

<12> Section 3.2.5.1.3: In Windows implementation, if more data is received for a message than the receiver can parse, the receiver parses only the portion of the data that it is able to parse and ignores the rest. For every type of message, the size of the received data is verified to make sure that the message is large enough to contain all the fields for that particular message. If this is not the case, the connection is terminated.

<13> Section 3.2.5.1.3: In Windows implementations, all the window and application data stored by the receiver is removed when a [Filter-Updated PDU](#Section_4.1.1) is received, as the [**sharing manager**](#gt_sharing-manager) is about to send an updated list.

<14> Section 3.2.5.1.4: In Windows implementations, if more data is received for a message than the receiver can parse, the receiver parses only the portion of the data that it is able to parse and ignores the rest. For every type of message, the size of the received data is verified to make sure that the message is large enough to contain all the fields for that particular message. If this is not the case, the connection is terminated.

<15> Section 3.2.5.1.5: In Windows implementations, if more data is received for a message than the receiver can parse, the receiver parses only the portion of the data that it is able to parse and ignores the rest. For every type of message, the size of the received data is verified to make sure that the message is big enough to contain all the fields for that particular message. If this is not the case, the connection is terminated.

<16> Section 3.2.5.1.6: In Windows implementations, if more data is received for a message than the receiver can parse, the receiver parses only the portion of the data that it is able to parse and ignores the rest. For every type of message, the size of the received data is verified to make sure that the message is large enough to contain all the fields for that particular message. If this is not the case, the connection is terminated.

<17> Section 3.2.5.2.1: In Windows implementations, if more data is received for a message than the receiver can parse, the receiver parses only the portion of the data that it is able to parse and ignores the rest. For every type of message, the size of the received data is verified to make sure that the message is large enough to contain all the fields for that particular message. If this is not the case, the connection is terminated.

<18> Section 3.2.5.2.1: When a client is connected and authenticated, the server tries to inform the client which participant in the list corresponds to the client itself. This communication is done by sending a [Participant-Created PDU](#Section_4.1.2) to only that client but with the IS_PARTICIPANT set to 1. The client verifies the presence of the flag and remembers the **ParticipantId** as corresponding to itself.

<19> Section 3.2.5.2.1: In Windows implementations, the **GroupId** field is not interpreted by the participant.

<20> Section 3.2.5.2.2: In Windows implementations, if more data is received for a message than the receiver can parse, the receiver parses only the portion of the data that it is able to parse and ignores the rest. For every type of message, the size of the received data is verified to make sure that the message is large enough to contain all the fields for that particular message. If this is not the case, the connection is terminated.

<21> Section 3.2.5.2.2: Windows does not parse the **DiscType** and **DiscCode** fields.

<22> Section 3.2.5.2.3: In Windows implementations, if more data is received for a message than the receiver can parse, the receiver parses only the portion of the data that it is able to parse and ignores the rest. For every type of message, the size of the received data is verified to make sure that the message is large enough to contain all the fields for that particular message. If this is not the case, the connection is terminated.

<23> Section 3.2.5.3.1: In Windows implementations, if more data is received for a message than the receiver can parse, the receiver parses only the portion of the data the receiver knows how to parse and ignores the rest. For every type of message, the size of the received data is verified to make sure that the message is large enough to contain all the fields for that particular message. If this is not the case, the connection is terminated.

<24> Section 3.2.5.3.2: In Windows implementations, if more data is received for a message than the receiver can parse, the receiver parses only the portion of the data that it is able to parse and ignores the rest. For every type of message, the size of the received data is verified to make sure that the message is large enough to contain all the fields for that particular message. If this is not the case, the connection is terminated.

<25> Section 3.3.5.1.1: In Windows implementations, if more data is received for a message than the receiver can parse, the receiver parses only the portion of the data that it is able to parse and ignores the rest. For every type of message, the size of the received data is verified to make sure that the message is large enough to contain all the fields for that particular message. If this is not the case, the connection is terminated.

<26> Section 3.3.5.1.1: In Windows implementations, the server keeps all the windows of interest in a list. When the client requests that a window be displayed, the server checks if the window is in the list. If the window is in the list, the server attempts to show the window. Otherwise, the message is ignored.

<27> Section 3.3.5.1.1: In Windows implementations, the server verifies that the client sending the message has the right to interact with the desktop before showing the window. If the client does not have the right to interact with the desktop, the message is ignored.

<28> Section 3.3.5.2.1: In Windows implementations, a Participant-Created PDU (OD_PARTICIPANT_CREATED) is not sent by the participant.

<29> Section 3.3.5.2.2: In Windows implementations, a Participant-Removed PDU (OD_PARTICIPANT_REMOVED) is neither sent by the participant nor interpreted by the sharing manager.

<30> Section 3.3.5.2.3: In Windows implementation, if more data is received for a message than the receiver can parse, the receiver parses only the portion of the data that it is able to parse and ignores the rest. For every type of message, the size of the received data is verified to make sure that the message is large enough to contain all the fields for that particular message. If this is not the case, the connection is terminated.

Also in Windows implementations, a value of ALLOW_CONTROL_REQUEST in the **Flags** field is not sent by the participant and not interpreted by the sharing manager.
