# 1 Introduction

This document describes the Windows protocols documentation set and provides a roadmap for navigating it. This document set includes detailed technical specifications for Windows protocols and extensions to industry-standard or other published protocols. These protocols and extensions provide a wide variety of services to Windows Workgroup networks.

The Windows protocols documentation set also includes companion overview and reference documents that supplement the technical specifications with conceptual background, descriptions of inter-protocol relationships, and technical reference information, such as common data types and error codes.

A cross-reference of the entire Windows protocols documentation set is provided in section [4](#Section_4).

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose [**directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds), which uses [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) as its primary access protocol. [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) stores information about a variety of objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md). [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is either deployed as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or [**Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)**](#gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds), which are both described in [MS-ADOD](../MS-ADOD/MS-ADOD.md): Active Directory Protocols Overview.

<a id="gt_active-directory-federation-services-ad-fs"></a>
**Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)**: A Microsoft implementation of a federation services provider, which provides a security token service (STS) that can issue security tokens to a caller using various protocols such as WS-Trust, WS-Federation, and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) version 2.0.

<a id="gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds"></a>
**Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)**: A [**directory service (DS)**](#gt_directory-service-ds) implemented by a domain controller (DC). AD LDS is a deployment of [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md). The most significant difference between [**AD LDS**](#gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds) and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is that [**AD LDS**](#gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds) does not host domain naming contexts (domain NCs). A server can host multiple [**AD LDS**](#gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds) DCs. Each DC is an independent [**AD LDS**](#gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds) instance, with its own independent state. [**AD LDS**](#gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds) can be run as an operating system [**DS**](#gt_directory-service-ds) or as a directory service provided by a standalone application (Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM)).

<a id="gt_american-national-standards-institute-ansi-character-set"></a>
**American National Standards Institute (ANSI) character set**: A character set defined by a [**code page**](#gt_code-page) approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The term "ANSI" as used to signify Windows code pages is a historical reference and a misnomer that persists in the Windows community. The source of this misnomer stems from the fact that the Windows code page 1252 was originally based on an ANSI draft, which became International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 8859-1 [[ISO/IEC-8859-1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90689). In Windows, the ANSI character set can be any of the following code pages: 1252, 1250, 1251, 1253, 1254, 1255, 1256, 1257, 1258, 874, 932, 936, 949, or 950. For example, "ANSI application" is usually a reference to a non-[**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) or code-page-based application. Therefore, "ANSI character set" is often misused to refer to one of the character sets defined by a Windows code page that can be used as an active system code page; for example, character sets defined by code page 1252 or character sets defined by code page 950. Windows is now based on [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode), so the use of ANSI character sets is strongly discouraged unless they are used to interoperate with legacy applications or legacy data.

<a id="gt_augmented-backus-naur-form-abnf"></a>
**Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)**: A modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), commonly used by Internet specifications. ABNF notation balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power. ABNF differs from standard BNF in its definitions and uses of naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges. For more information, see [[RFC5234]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096).

<a id="gt_authentication"></a>
**authentication**: The ability of one entity to determine the identity of another entity.

<a id="gt_authorization"></a>
**authorization**: The secure computation of roles and accesses granted to an identity.

<a id="gt_certificate"></a>
**certificate**: A certificate is a collection of attributes and extensions that can be stored persistently. The set of attributes in a certificate can vary depending on the intended usage of the certificate. A certificate securely binds a public key to the entity that holds the corresponding private key. A certificate is commonly used for authentication and secure exchange of information on open networks, such as the Internet, extranets, and intranets. Certificates are digitally signed by the issuing [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) and can be issued for a user, a computer, or a service. The most widely accepted format for certificates is defined by the ITU-T X.509 version 3 international standards. For more information about attributes and extensions, see [[RFC3280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90414) and [[X509]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90590) sections 7 and 8.

<a id="gt_certificate-services"></a>
**certificate services**: The Microsoft implementation of a [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) that is part of the server operating system. [**Certificate services**](#gt_certificate-services) include tools to manage issued [**certificates**](#gt_certificate), publish [**CA**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) [**certificates**](#gt_certificate) and CRLs, configure [**CAs**](#gt_certification-authority-ca), import and export [**certificates**](#gt_certificate) and keys, and recover archived private keys.

<a id="gt_certification-authority-ca"></a>
**certification authority (CA)**: A third party that issues public key [**certificates**](#gt_certificate). Certificates serve to bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide whether to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust should be transitive. For more information, see [[RFC3280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90414).

<a id="gt_code-page"></a>
**code page**: An ordered set of characters of a specific script in which a numerical index (code-point value) is associated with each character. Code pages are a means of providing support for character sets and keyboard layouts used in different countries. Devices such as the display and keyboard can be configured to use a specific code page and to switch from one code page (such as the United States) to another (such as Portugal) at the user's request.

<a id="gt_common-information-model-cim"></a>
**Common Information Model (CIM)**: The Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) model that describes how to represent real-world computer and network objects. CIM uses an object-oriented paradigm, where managed objects are modeled using the concepts of classes and instances. See [[DMTF-DSP0004]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89848).

<a id="gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl"></a>
**conceptual schema definition language (CSDL)**: A language that is based on XML and that can be used to define conceptual models that are based on the Entity Data Model (EDM).

<a id="gt_directory-service-ds"></a>
**directory service (DS)**: A service that stores and organizes information about a computer network's users and network shares, and that allows network administrators to manage users' access to the shares. See also [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory).

<a id="gt_distributed-component-object-model-dcom"></a>
**Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)**: The Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) specification that defines how components communicate over networks, as specified in [MS-DCOM](../MS-DCOM/MS-DCOM.md).

<a id="gt_domain"></a>
**domain**: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set must act as a domain controller (DC) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) service. The domain controller provides authentication of members, creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD](../MS-AUTHSOD/MS-AUTHSOD.md) section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

The JSON format is based on the structure of ECMAScript (Jscript, JavaScript) objects.

<a id="gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap"></a>
**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**: The primary access protocol for [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory). Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an industry-standard protocol, established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which allows users to query and update information in a [**directory service (DS)**](#gt_directory-service-ds), as described in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md). The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol can be either version 2 [[RFC1777]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90290) or version 3 [[RFC3377]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91337).

<a id="gt_microsoft-interface-definition-language-midl"></a>
**Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL)**: The Microsoft implementation and extension of the OSF-DCE [**Interface Definition Language (IDL)**](#gt_interface-definition-language-idl). [**MIDL**](#gt_microsoft-interface-definition-language-midl) can also mean the [**Interface Definition Language (IDL)**](#gt_interface-definition-language-idl) compiler provided by Microsoft. For more information, see [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

<a id="gt_namespace"></a>

<a id="gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc"></a>
**remote procedure call (RPC)**: A communication protocol used primarily between client and server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message). For more information, see [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824).

<a id="gt_representational-state-transfer-rest"></a>
**Representational State Transfer (REST)**: A class of web services that is used to transfer domain-specific data by using [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http), without additional messaging layers or session tracking, and returns textual data, such as [**XML**](#gt_xml).

<a id="gt_schema"></a>
**schema**: The set of attributes and object classes that govern the creation and update of objects.

<a id="gt_security-identifier-sid"></a>
**security identifier (SID)**: An identifier for security principals that is used to identify an account or a group. Conceptually, the [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is composed of an account authority portion (typically a [**domain**](#gt_domain)) and a smaller integer representing an identity relative to the account authority, termed the relative identifier (RID). The [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) format is specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.4.2; a string representation of [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.4.2 and [MS-AZOD](../MS-AZOD/MS-AZOD.md) section 1.1.1.2.

<a id="gt_soap"></a>
**SOAP**: A lightweight protocol for exchanging structured information in a decentralized, distributed environment. [**SOAP**](#gt_soap) uses [**XML**](#gt_xml) technologies to define an extensible messaging framework, which provides a message construct that can be exchanged over a variety of underlying protocols. The framework has been designed to be independent of any particular programming model and other implementation-specific semantics. SOAP 1.2 supersedes SOAP 1.1. See [[SOAP1.2-1/2003]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90521).

<a id="gt_terminal-services-ts"></a>
**terminal services (TS)**: A service on a server computer that allows delivery of applications, or the desktop itself, to various computing devices. When a user runs an application on a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server), the application execution takes place on the server computer and only keyboard, mouse, and display information is transmitted over the network. Each user sees only his or her individual session, which is managed transparently by the server operating system and is independent of any other client session.

<a id="gt_transaction"></a>
**transaction**: In OleTx, an atomic transaction.

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world.

<a id="gt_utf-16"></a>
**UTF-16**: A standard for encoding Unicode characters, defined in the Unicode standard, in which the most commonly used characters are defined as double-byte characters. Unless specified otherwise, this term refers to the UTF-16 encoding form specified in [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) section 3.9.

<a id="gt_web-services-description-language-wsdl"></a>
**Web Services Description Language (WSDL)**: An XML format for describing network services as a set of endpoints that operate on messages that contain either document-oriented or procedure-oriented information. The operations and messages are described abstractly and are bound to a concrete network protocol and message format in order to define an endpoint. Related concrete endpoints are combined into abstract endpoints, which describe a network service. WSDL is extensible, which allows the description of endpoints and their messages regardless of the message formats or network protocols that are used.

![Relationships among documents](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Relationships among documents

As shown in the diagram, the technical specifications of the Windows protocols documentation set are categorized according to [**technical area**](#gt_technical-area). Within a technical area, a technology overview and related technical specifications make up a [**technology collection**](#gt_technology-collection). More than one technology collection can be defined in a technical area. The technical areas and different document types are described in Documentation Contents (section [2](#Section_2)). The technical specifications are listed in the Technical Specification Cross-Reference Matrix (section [4.1](#Section_4.1)); the technical areas are listed in the Technical Area Cross-Reference Matrix (section [4.2](#Section_4.2)); and the technology collections are listed in the Technology Collection Cross-Reference Matrix (section [4.3](#Section_4.3)).

<a id="Section_1.3.3"></a>
### 1.3.3 Naming Conventions

The Windows protocols documentation set uses the following naming conventions for all overview documents, technical specifications, and reference documents.

- All documents are assigned a short name enclosed in square brackets. The short name is used when citing the document or reference. Examples of short names are "[MS-DOCO]", "[MSFT-WSTS]", and "[RFC2119]".
- All short names for documents in the documentation set have one of the following forms:
- [MC-XXX] was originally used for documents that specify technology that has never shipped with Windows. However, that restriction has been removed, and there is now no distinction between documents with short names prefaced with "MC" and those with short names prefaced with "MS". An example of this type of short name is "[MC-BUP]", where the suffix "BUP" is an abbreviation for "Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) Upload Protocol".
- [MS-XXXOD] is used for technology overviews (section [2.1.3](#Section_4.3)). An example of this type of short name is "[MS-AUTHSOD]", where the suffix "AUTHS" is an abbreviation for "Authentication Services Protocols".
- [MS-XXX] is used for all other overview, technical, and reference documents with short names that do not follow one of the preceding conventions. The suffix "XXX" is an abbreviation that refers to the subject covered by the document. An example of this type of short name is "[MS-WPO]", where "WPO" is an abbreviation for "Windows Protocols Overview". The short name of the current document, "[MS-DOCO]", also falls into this category.
- Short names for reference documents that describe Microsoft technology conform to the following naming conventions:
- [MSFT-XXX] is used for information in Microsoft TechNet articles.
- [KBNNNNN] and [MSFT-KBNNNNN] are used for Knowledge Base articles, where NNNNN is the article number.
- [PRA-XXX] is used for downloadable informative technical documents in PDF format.
- Short names for RFC documents are in the form [RFCNNNN], where NNNN is the RFC number.
- Each document has a title that conforms to the following conventions:
- The titles of technology overviews end with the word "Overview".
- The titles of technical specifications that specify Microsoft extensions to non-Microsoft protocols and structures end with either the word "Extension" or "Extensions".
- The titles of technical specifications that specify algorithms, protocols, and structures end with the word "Specification".
**Note** The titles of [MS-DOCO] and [MS-WPO] are exceptions to these document title conventions.

- Each document has a long name, which is composed of its short name, a colon, and its title. Examples of long names are "[MS-DOCO]: Windows Protocols Documentation Roadmap" and "[MS-RPRN]: Print System Remote Protocol Specification".
<a id="Section_1.3.4"></a>
### 1.3.4 Document Versions

Documents in the Windows protocols documentation set are assigned a version number that changes each time the document is updated. The title page of each document contains a revision summary table that shows the top-level history of changes to the document. This revision summary table contains the date of each release and the corresponding version number, revision class, and comment that describes the change.

The version number and revision class are correlated as shown in the following table:

| Version number | Revision class | Version number change | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | New | Not applicable | First release of the document. |
| 2.0 | Major | Number to the left of the first decimal point | Significantly changed the technical content. |
| 2.1 | Minor | Number to the right of the first decimal point | Clarified the meaning of the technical content. |
| 2.1.1 | Editorial | Number to the right of the second decimal point | Changed language and/or formatting of the technical content. |
| 2.1.1 | None | No change | No change to the meaning, language or formatting of the technical content. |

**Note** Starting with Windows 8, the initial release version number was standardized at 1.0. Documents created prior to Windows 8 can have a different initial release version number, such as 0.1 or 0.01.

Each overview document and technical specification also contains its own more detailed Change Tracking Appendix, which lists the changes made to each section in the latest release.

## 2.2 Technical Specifications

This section describes the details of protocols, structures and standards that are specified in technical specifications. The goal of the technical specifications is to support interoperability, not to describe the Windows implementations of the technology. For example, many protocols specify client and server roles; for such protocols, the information contained in technical specifications fulfills the three general interoperability cases:

- Implement a client that interoperates with a server implemented in Windows.
- Implement a server that interoperates with a client implemented in Windows.
- Implement a client and a server that interoperate with each other on a non-Windows operating system.
Other types of protocols, as well as structures, algorithms, and so on, are also documented to support interoperability in both Windows and non-Windows operating environments.

Technical specifications consist of both normative and informative content.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Normative Content

Normative content refers to technical details that are essential for implementing software that interoperates with Windows. This content is written using the prescriptive language of RFCs as defined in [RFC2119], including the verb forms MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT.

- **MUST and MUST NOT** emphasize behavior that is required or prohibited, respectively, by the technology for interoperability, such as setting a field to zero, using a reply packet, or performing a action when a certain type of packet is received.
In a normative section of a specification, any statement that does not use a prescriptive verb means that the behavior is required, as if a MUST were used explicitly.

- **MAY** means that the behavior is optional. A product behavior note (PBN) is required if the behavior is implemented in at least one applicable Windows version; the absence of a PBN means that no Windows version implements the behavior. PBNs are informative content (section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2)).
- **SHOULD** means that the behavior is optional but recommended by the designers of the technology. A PBN is required if the behavior is absent from at least one applicable Windows version; the absence of a PBN means that all product versions implement the behavior.
- **SHOULD NOT** means that the behavior is optional and not recommended by the designers of the technology. An implementer should understand and carefully consider the implications of the behavior before it is implemented. A PBN is required if the behavior is implemented in at least one applicable Windows version; the absence of a PBN means that no Windows version implements the behavior.
For all optional behavior, an implementation that does not do the behavior must be interoperable with one that does, and vice versa.

Normative content includes the following categories of information:

- Classes of functionality (roles)
- Data definitions (constants, enumerations, structures, and so on)
- Encryption
- Message formats and processing
- Method signatures and return values
- Schemas and namespaces
- State transitions
- Timers, events, and event processing
- Transport
- Vendor-extensible fields
Technical specifications that reference [**directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds) [**schema**](#gt_schema) element class/attribute pairs (section [2.2.3.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.3.1)), cite one or more of the following normative references:

- [[MS-ADA1]: Active Directory Schema Attributes A-L](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/19528560-f41e-4623-a406-dabcfff0660f/)
- [[MS-ADA2]: Active Directory Schema Attributes M](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e20ebc4e-5285-40ba-b3bd-ffcb81c2783e/)
- [[MS-ADA3]: Active Directory Schema Attributes N-Z](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4517e835-3ee6-44d4-bb95-a94b6966bfb0/)
- [[MS-ADSC]: Active Directory Schema Classes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9abb5e97-123d-4da9-9557-b353ab79b830/)
- [[MS-ADLS]: Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services Schema](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/94279943-25ab-4c13-9bf2-6d411cc2f796/)
Technical specifications that use common data types (section [2.2.3.3.2](#Section_2.2.3.3.2)) cite the following normative reference:

- [[MS-DTYP]: Windows Data Types](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cca27429-5689-4a16-b2b4-9325d93e4ba2/)
Technical specifications that reference HRESULT, NTStatus, or Win32 error codes (section [2.2.3.3.3](#Section_2.2.3.3.3)) cite the following normative reference:

- [[MS-ERREF]: Windows Error Codes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1bc92ddf-b79e-413c-bbaa-99a5281a6c90/)
Technical specifications that reference landing code identifiers (LCIDs) (section [2.2.3.3.4](#Section_2.2.3.3.4)) cite the following normative reference:

- [[MS-LCID]: Windows Language Code Identifier (LCID) Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/70feba9f-294e-491e-b6eb-56532684c37f/)
<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 Informative Content

Content that is not normative in technical specifications is informative, and it is provided only as a helpful guide to the implementer. Informative content is not essential for implementation and includes the following categories of information:

- Abstract data models
- Capability negotiations
- Examples
- Implementation-specific parameters
- Relationships to other protocols
- Security parameters
- Versioning
- Windows-version-specific behaviors
Windows-version-specific behavior is described in footnotes to the main body of a specification. That information is not normative and is provided to support interoperability across multiple versions of Windows Client operating system and applicable Windows Server releases. The following criteria are used to determine whether information is not appropriate in the body of a technical specification and gets placed in a product behavior footnote:

- The information varies by Windows product.
- The information concerns an implementation limit for a data structure; for example, maximum entries or queue size.
- The information concerns a retry interval.
- The information concerns a retry count prior to returning a specified error code.
- The information concerns a specific buffer size choice, when other buffer sizes will work.
- The information concerns loading implementation-specific configuration information from the [**Windows registry**](#gt_windows-registry).
<a id="Section_2.2.3"></a>
### 2.2.3 Template Types

In general, each technical specification conforms to one of a set of document templates, based on the type of information that is conveyed by the associated protocol or structure:

- Algorithm: Algorithms used in network communication.
- Block: Generic message-based protocols.
- Data Structure: Structures used by one or more algorithms or protocols.
- File Structure: The formats of files used to convey information between systems.
- HTTP: Protocols based on [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http) APIs, including RESTful and REST-like protocols.
- RPC: [**Remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) method-based client/server protocols.
- SOAP: Request/response protocols that are defined by using [**Web Services Description Language (WSDL)**](#gt_web-services-description-language-wsdl).
- Standards Support: Microsoft implementation conformance with an external standard.
The following sections provide general descriptions of these document templates. The template used for each technical specification in the Windows protocols documentation set is listed in [Technical Specification Cross-Reference Matrix (section 4.1)](#Section_4.1).

<a id="Section_2.2.3.1"></a>
#### 2.2.3.1 Algorithm

An Algorithm technical specification defines an algorithm or extension to an algorithm that is used in network communication. An Algorithm document defines no data structure or data sent over the wire. If the algorithm is associated with a data structure, they are either documented separately in Algorithm and Structure technical specifications or together in a Block technical specification.

A technical specification that specifies a protocol can refer to an Algorithm document, but if the algorithm is specific to the protocol, it can be documented within the protocol document.

If the algorithm inherently has different classes of functionality, or "roles", normative information is provided for each. If enough logic is common between roles that it makes sense to not duplicate it, a section titled "Common Algorithm Details" can be specified. For example, for compression and decompression algorithms, a section for common details might be included with the role-specific sections "Compression Algorithm Details" and "Decompression Algorithm Details".

Algorithm technical specifications can contain the following types of normative information, where applicable:

- Classes of functionality (roles)
- Processing rules
- State transitions
<a id="Section_2.2.3.2"></a>
#### 2.2.3.2 Block

A Block technical specification defines a packet-based protocol. The name "Block" is a reference to the block diagrams that are frequently used to express interaction patterns. The Block type of technical specification is also used if no other type of document is appropriate for the protocol or format being specified.

Block technical specifications specify exactly how data is marshaled that is sent or received over a network, which requires a definition of the byte order of packet data. Message syntax is specified by using packet diagrams that are 32-bits wide, with bit 0 on the far left, as shown in the following example.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-15: "Field Name 1"
  16-31: "Field Name 2"
  32-63: "Field Name 3 (optional)"
```

The bit numbering convention that is followed is big-endian; namely, the most significant bit of the first byte to traverse the network is bit 0, and the least significant bit of the last byte to traverse the network is in bit 31. The byte order format can be different in the operating environment, so it is specified in the document for multibyte data fields.

Block technical specifications can contain the following types of normative information, where applicable:

- [**Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)**](#gt_augmented-backus-naur-form-abnf) syntax [[RFC5234]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096)

<a id="Section_2.2.3.3"></a>
#### 2.2.3.3 Data Structure

A Data Structure technical specification specifies a common structure or an extension to a common data structure that is used by multiple protocols. The description does not include related behavior. Behavior is defined in the specifications for protocols that use the data structure.

Data Structure technical specifications specify how data is decoded and encoded as it is processed in the specific operating environment. If the data is in XML, the schemas and namespaces are specified.

Data Structure technical specifications can contain the following types of normative information, where applicable:

- [**Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)**](#gt_augmented-backus-naur-form-abnf) syntax [[RFC5234]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096)
- Binary packet structure
- Data and type definitions (constants, enumerations, structures, and so on)

<a id="Section_2.2.3.4"></a>
#### 2.2.3.4 File Structure

A File Structure technical specification specifies the structure and contents of a file that can be sent over the network. Rules for accessing and processing the contents of the file can be specified in this type of technical specification.

File Structure technical specifications specify how data is encoded by the creator and decoded by the consumer as it is passed within the operating environment. If the data is in XML, the schemas and namespaces are specified.

File Structure technical specifications can contain the following types of normative information, where applicable:

- [**Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)**](#gt_augmented-backus-naur-form-abnf) syntax [[RFC5234]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096)

<a id="Section_2.2.3.5"></a>
#### 2.2.3.5 HTTP

An HTTP technical specification defines a protocol that uses an [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http)-based API with a simplified set of HTTP functions, such as GET and POST, to make API calls. It can also use a [**Representational State Transfer (REST)**](#gt_representational-state-transfer-rest) client/server architecture in which requests and responses are built around the transfers of resource representations, which are documents that capture the current or intended states of resources. HTTP technical specifications specify the web resources that are accessed and manipulated by the protocol, HTTP operations that can be applied to the resources, and the syntax of request/response payloads.

An HTTP specification can specify either a REST-like or RESTful protocol. In general, "REST-like" refers to a protocol that uses simple URI-based requests to a specific domain over HTTP. "RESTful" refers to a protocol that conforms to certain constraints including a client/server architecture, statelessness, and a uniform interface.

HTTP specifications can contain the following types of normative information, where applicable:

- [**Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)**](#gt_augmented-backus-naur-form-abnf) syntax [[RFC5234]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096)

<a id="Section_2.2.3.6"></a>
#### 2.2.3.6 RPC

An [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) technical specification defines a method-based protocol, which uses a formal syntax with calls and return codes, and in which a protocol client initiates all communication and a protocol server responds to the protocol client. RPC specifies request/response protocols, in which all arguments come directly from the higher layer, and all return codes, output parameters, and exceptions are passed unmodified.

Some RPC specifications specify protocols that use the [**Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)**](#gt_distributed-component-object-model-dcom) as their transport, which uses the TCP/IP RPC protocol sequence. Such protocols can use the DCOM security and [**authentication**](#gt_authentication) framework and interface activation.

RPC specifications use [**Interface Definition Language (IDL)**](#gt_interface-definition-language-idl) to specify the syntax of protocol methods and marshaling of protocol data. Such interface definitions can be compiled by using the [**Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL)**](#gt_microsoft-interface-definition-language-midl) compiler with command-line parameters, as follows: "midl /target NT60 /nologo". To avoid duplicating the definitions of common data types, RPC protocol IDL sections can contain one or more import directives for IDL data from other technical specifications, including the following:

- [[MS-DCOM]: Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) Remote Protocol](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4a893f3d-bd29-48cd-9f43-d9777a4415b0/) Appendix A: Full IDL (section 6)

<a id="Section_2.2.3.7"></a>
#### 2.2.3.7 SOAP

A [**Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)**](#gt_soap) [[SOAP1.1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90520) [[SOAP1.2/1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90521) [[SOAP1.2/2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90522) technical specification defines a packet-based protocols. Unlike Block technical specifications, SOAP specifies request/response, SOAP-based protocols that use [**Web Services Description Language (WSDL)**](#gt_web-services-description-language-wsdl). SOAP technical specifications typically apply to Web services.

A SOAP technical specification uses the features and mechanisms defined in [**XML**](#gt_xml) and WSDL to define the protocol as closely as those mechanisms allow. SOAP services support the feature of returning XSD and WSDL documents that describe the protocol that the service implements. If the XSD includes character data that follows a grammar that cannot be described in the XSD, the grammar can be defined in the technical specification, or a normative reference to the grammar definition is provided. If the character data has some internal syntax that is not defined in a normative reference, the syntax is specified in the technical specification by using "augmented" BNF (ABNF).

If the XSD includes binary data that follows a grammar that cannot be described in the XSD, the grammar is defined in the technical specification, or a normative reference to the grammar definition is provided. If the grammar is defined in the technical specification, the packet definition format used in Block technical specifications (section [2.2.3.2](#Section_2.2.3.2)) is used.

SOAP technical specifications can contain the following types of normative information, where applicable:

- [**Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)**](#gt_augmented-backus-naur-form-abnf) syntax [[RFC5234]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096)
- [**Directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds) [**schema**](#gt_schema) classes and attributes [MS-ADA1](../MS-ADA1/MS-ADA1.md) [MS-ADA2](../MS-ADA2/MS-ADA2.md) [MS-ADA3](../MS-ADA3/MS-ADA3.md) [MS-ADLS](../MS-ADLS/MS-ADLS.md) [MS-ADSC](../MS-ADSC/MS-ADSC.md)
- [**Namespaces**](#gt_namespace) [[XMLNS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=191840)
- [**WSDL messages**](#gt_wsdl-message) [[WSDL]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90577)
- [**XML schema definitions (XSDs)**](#gt_xml-schema-definition-xsd) [[XML10]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90600) [[XMLINFOSET]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=145519) [[XMLSCHEMA1/2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90607) [[XMLSCHEMA2/2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90609)
<a id="Section_2.2.3.8"></a>
#### 2.2.3.8 Standards Support

A Standards Support technical specification describes how a Microsoft implementation or set of implementations conform to or vary from an existing specification such as a standard, a third-party specification, or any published specification.

A Standards Support document is essentially an appendix of implementation choices made and information about those choices. For example, a standard might specify that an implementation provides any of seven date/time values. A Standards Support document would indicate which date/time values are supported in the Microsoft implementation. If the implementation provides an eighth value—that is, one not from the standard, that variance from the standard would be defined in a normative section of the Standards Support document.

Standards Support documents can contain the following types of normative information, where applicable:

- Error handling variations from the standard
- Extensions to the standard
- Normative variations from the standard

References to other Windows documents do not include dates of publication, because the citations always link to the latest version. References to other documents include a publishing year when one is available.

The subsections in this section describe the types of links in the Windows protocols documentation set.

### 3.3.1 Normative Citations

Normative citations refer to information that is required in order to understand or implement the technology defined in a specification or for that technology to work.

Citations to normative content are distinguished by the use of the words "defined", "specified", and "details".

<a id="Section_3.3.1.1"></a>
#### 3.3.1.1 External Normative Citations

External citations to normative content include references to any of the following:

- Documents published by standards organizations (section [2.4.2](#Section_2.4.2)).
- RFCs (section [2.4.3](#Section_2.4.3)).
- Normative sections in other Windows technical specifications (section [3.3.1.2](#Section_3.3.1.2)).
All external normative documents are listed in the normative references section of the referencing technical specification.

<a id="Section_3.3.1.2"></a>
#### 3.3.1.2 Internal Normative Citations

Internal citations to normative content are references to normative sections within a technical specification. The sections—including their subsections—that contain normative content in a technical specification vary according to the template type, as follows:

Algorithm template:

- 1.6 Standards Assignments
- 2.0 Algorithm Details
Block, HTTP, RPC, and SOAP protocol templates:

- 1.5 Prerequisites and Preconditions
- 1.8 Vendor Extensible Fields
- 1.9 Standards Assignments
- 2.0 Messages
- 3.0 Protocol Details
Data and File Structure templates:

- 1.7 Vendor -Extensible Fields
- 2.0 Structures
For more information about the document templates, see section [2.2](#Section_3.2.1.2).

### 3.3.2 Informative Citations

Informative citations refer to information that is not required in order to understand or implement the technology defined in a specification, such as background or implementation-specific information.

Citations to informative content are distinguished by the use of the words "described" and "information".

<a id="Section_3.3.2.1"></a>
#### 3.3.2.1 External Informative Citations

Citations to external informative content include references to any of the following:

- Any content that could qualify as an external normative reference (section [3.3.1.1](#Section_3.3.1.1)).
- [Microsoft Developer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2092989) articles.
- Windows overview documents (section [2.1](#Section_2.1)).
- Informative sections in other Windows technical specifications (section [2.2](#Section_3.2.1.2)).
- Windows reference documents (section [2.3](#Section_3.1.1.3.1)).
All external informative documents are listed in the informative references section of the referencing technical specification.

<a id="Section_3.3.2.2"></a>
#### 3.3.2.2 Internal Informative Citations

Internal citations to informative content are references to informative sections within a technical specification. Any content that is not normative is by definition informative, including Windows product behavior. The sections—including their subsections—that contain informative content in a technical specification vary according to the template type.

For more information about the document templates, see section [2.2](#Section_3.2.1.2).
