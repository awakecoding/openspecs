# 1 Introduction

The Service Witness Protocol is a remote procedure call (RPC)-based protocol that is used to promptly notify a client of resource changes that have occurred on a highly available server.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn"></a>
**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**: An unambiguous domain name that gives an absolute location in the Domain Name System's (DNS) hierarchy tree, as defined in [[RFC1035]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90264) section 3.1 and [[RFC2181]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=127732) section 11.

<a id="gt_internet-protocol-version-4-ipv4"></a>
**Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)**: An Internet protocol that has 32-bit source and destination addresses. IPv4 is the predecessor of IPv6.

<a id="gt_internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6"></a>
**Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)**: A revised version of the Internet Protocol (IP) designed to address growth on the Internet. Improvements include a 128-bit IP address size, expanded routing capabilities, and support for authentication and privacy.

<a id="gt_microsoft-interface-definition-language-midl"></a>
**Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL)**: The Microsoft implementation and extension of the OSF-DCE Interface Definition Language (IDL). [**MIDL**](#gt_microsoft-interface-definition-language-midl) can also mean the Interface Definition Language (IDL) compiler provided by Microsoft. For more information, see [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

<a id="gt_netbios-name"></a>
**NetBIOS name**: A 16-byte address that is used to identify a NetBIOS resource on the network. For more information, see [[RFC1001]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90260) and [[RFC1002]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90261).

<a id="gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc"></a>
**remote procedure call (RPC)**: A communication protocol used primarily between client and server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message). For more information, see [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824).

<a id="gt_rpc-context-handle"></a>
**RPC context handle**: A representation of state maintained between a remote procedure call (RPC) client and server. The state is maintained on the server on behalf of the client. An RPC context handle is created by the server and given to the client. The client passes the RPC context handle back to the server in method calls to assist in identifying the state. For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_rpc-server"></a>
**RPC server**: A computer on the network that waits for messages, processes them when they arrive, and sends responses using RPC as its transport acts as the responder during a remote procedure call (RPC) exchange.

<a id="gt_rpc-transport"></a>
**RPC transport**: The underlying network services used by the remote procedure call (RPC) runtime for communications between network nodes. For more information, see [C706] section 2.

<a id="gt_transmission-control-protocol-tcp"></a>
**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: A protocol used with the Internet Protocol (IP) to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. TCP handles keeping track of the individual units of data (called packets) that a message is divided into for efficient routing through the Internet.

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [C706] has to be used for generating the UUID.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

In highly available systems, there can be many instances of a service (for instance an SMB3 file service [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md)) that runs on a server or group of servers. These service instances are accessed by clients through network DNS names and associated IP addresses.

The Service Witness Protocol enables a client application (for instance, an SMB3 client) to receive prompt and explicit notifications about the failure or recovery of a network name and associated services, rather than relying on slower detection mechanisms such as time-outs and keep-alives.

The Service Witness Protocol is an independent protocol which is used alongside other protocols, as illustrated by the following figure.

![Witness clients communicating with Witness servers](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Witness clients communicating with Witness servers

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol depends on the [**RPC transport**](#gt_rpc-transport) and uses [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over [**TCP**](#gt_transmission-control-protocol-tcp), as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Service Witness Protocol is an RPC interface and, as a result, has the prerequisites that are described in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 1.5 as common to RPC interfaces.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol applies in the following environments, where it is important that:

- The client promptly detects when a resource has failed, and is now available for reconnection.
- The administrator controls the client use of server resources, for instance, to achieve load- balancing or during server maintenance periods.
<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

The protocol supports versioning negotiation. The current protocol supports two versions.

| Version | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Witness protocol version 1 | 0x00010001 |
| Witness protocol version 2 | 0x00020000 |

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor Extensible Fields

This protocol does not define any vendor-extensible fields.

This protocol uses Win32 error codes as defined in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.2. Vendors SHOULD reuse those values with their indicated meaning. Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the future.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

| Parameter | Value | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UUID for Witness | ccd8c074-d0e5-4a40-92b4-d074faa6ba28 | [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) |

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

This protocol MUST use the [**UUID**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid) as specified in section [1.9](#Section_1.9). The RPC version number is 1.0.

This protocol allows any user to establish a connection to the [**RPC server**](#gt_rpc-server). The protocol uses the underlying RPC protocol to retrieve the identity of the caller that made the method call, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.3.3.4.3. The server SHOULD use this identity to perform method-specific access checks as specified in section [3.1.4](#Section_3.2.4).

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Common Data Types

In addition to RPC base types defined in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md), the data types that follow are defined in the [**Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL)**](#gt_microsoft-interface-definition-language-midl) specification for this RPC interface.

# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Witness Server Details

The server responds to messages it receives from the client and also produces notifications as requested by the client. The server performs additional actions in response to administrative, configuration, and status changes on the machine, as driven by applications local to the server.

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This specification does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behaviors are consistent with that described in this specification.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.3"></a>
#### 3.1.1.3 Per WitnessRegistration in WitnessRegistrationList

The server implements the following properties per witness registration.

- **WitnessClientName**: A null-terminated string that contains the name of the client.
- **NetworkName**: The NetName specified in the client registration call.
- **IPAddress**: An IP address specified in the client registration call.

- **PendingChangeNotifications:** A list of change notifications pending for this registration.
- **PendingMoveNotification:** The most recent move notification, if any, pending for this registration.
If the server implements version 2 of the protocol, the server also implements the following properties:

- **WitnessClientVersion**: The Witness protocol version implemented by the client.
- **ShareName**: The *ShareName* specified in the client registration call.
- **ShareNameNotificationRequired**: A Boolean when set; indicates that this registration requires notifications based on the *ShareName*.

If the server implements version 2 of the protocol, it MUST implement this timer.

This timer controls the amount of time that a registration can stay unused, in other words, the time for which the registration is permitted to remain without registering for any asynchronous notifications. The server MUST schedule this timer periodically with an implementation-specific interval and remove unused registrations.

<a id="Section_3.1.2.2"></a>
#### 3.1.2.2 AsyncNotify Pending Timer

If the server implements version 2 of the protocol, it MUST implement this timer.

This timer controls the scheduling of periodic searches for pending asynchronous notifications that have passed their expiration time. This value is based on the **KeepAliveTimeout** value provided by the client as specified in section [3.1.4.5](#Section_3.1.4.5).

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The server MUST initialize **WitnessRegistrationList** to empty.

The server MUST initialize **InterfaceList** in an implementation-specific manner from the configuration store.

The server MUST initialize **WitnessServiceVersion** to the highest Witness protocol version supported by the server.<2>

The server MUST initialize **ServerGlobalName** with an administrator-defined string.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The Witness interface defines the following methods:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [WitnessrGetInterfaceList](#Section_3.1.4.1) | The WitnessrGetInterfaceList method returns information about the interfaces to which witness client connections can be made. Opnum: 0 |
| [WitnessrRegister](#Section_3.1.4.2) | The WitnessrRegister method allows the witness client to register for notifications from the server. Opnum: 1 |
| [WitnessrUnRegister](#Section_3.1.4.3) | The WitnessrUnRegister method allows the client to unregister for notifications from the server. Opnum: 2 |
| [WitnessrAsyncNotify](#Section_3.1.4.4) | The WitnessrAsyncNotify method is used by the client to request notification of resource changes from the server. Opnum: 3 |
| [WitnessrRegisterEx](#Section_3.1.4.5) | The WitnessrRegisterEx method allows the witness client to register for notifications from the server for a specific share and with optional flags. This opnum is only applicable for Witness protocol version 2. Opnum: 4 |
| [WitnessrUnRegisterEx](#Section_3.1.4.6) | The **WitnessrUnRegisterEx** method allows the client to unregister for notifications from the server.<3> The Witness Service removes its internal state of the registration and no longer notifies the client in the event of any resource state changes. This opnum is only applicable for Witness protocol version 2. Opnum: 5 |

For all methods, the server SHOULD<4> enforce security measures to verify that the caller has the required permissions to execute any method. If the server enforces security measures, and the caller does not have the required credentials, then the server MUST fail the call and return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED. For more details about how to determine the identity of the caller for the purpose of performing an access check, see [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.3.3.1.3.

The server MUST copy the **WitnessRegistration.RegistrationKey** into the *ppContext* parameter.

The server MUST return ERROR_SUCCESS and the *ppContext* parameter to the caller.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.6"></a>
#### 3.1.4.6 WitnessrUnRegisterEx (Opnum 5)

The **WitnessrUnRegisterEx** method allows the client to unregister for notifications from the server.<6> The Witness Service removes its internal state of the registration and no longer notifies the client in the event of any resource state changes.

DWORD WitnessrUnRegisterEx(

[in] handle_t Handle,

[in, out] PPCONTEXT_HANDLE ppContext);

**Handle:** An RPC binding handle [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824).

**ppContext:** A context handle of type PPCONTEXT_HANDLE, specified in section [2.2.1.2](#Section_2.2.1.2), that identifies the client on the server.

**Return Values:** Returns 0x00000000 (ERROR_SUCCESS) on success or a nonzero error code, as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.2. The most common error codes are listed in the following table.

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 ERROR_SUCCESS | The operation completed successfully. |
| 0x00000005 ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED | Access is denied. |
| 0x00000490 ERROR_NOT_FOUND | The specified CONTEXT_HANDLE is not found. |

The server MUST search for **WitnessRegistration** in **WitnessRegistrationList**, where **WitnessRegistration.RegistrationKey** matches the p*pContext* parameter.

If no matching entry is found, the server MUST stop processing the request and return the error code ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.

If the matching entry is found, the server MUST remove the **WitnessRegistration** entry from **WitnessRegistrationList.** The server MUST set *ppContext* to NULL and return ERROR_SUCCESS to the caller.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Timer Events

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>
#### 3.1.5.1 Unused Registration Timer Event

If the server implements version 2 of the protocol, it MUST implement this timer event.

When the Unused Registration Timer (section [3.1.2.1](#Section_3.1.2.1)) expires, the server MUST search for the **WitnessRegistration** entry in **WitnessRegistrationList**. If **WitnessRegistration.IsAsyncNotifyRegistered** is FALSE and **WitnessRegistration.LastUseTime** plus an implementation-specific time-out<7> is earlier than the current time, the server MUST remove the **WitnessRegistration** entry from the **WitnessRegistrationList**.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2"></a>
#### 3.1.5.2 AsyncNotify Pending Timer Event

If the server implements version 2 of the protocol, it MUST implement this timer event.

When the Notification Pending Timer (section [3.1.2.2](#Section_3.1.2.2)) expires, the server MUST search for the **WitnessRegistration** entry in **WitnessRegistrationList**. If **WitnessRegistration.IsAsyncNotifyRegistered** is TRUE and **WitnessRegistration.LastUseTime** plus **WitnessRegistration.KeepAliveTime** is earlier than the current time, the server MUST fail the request with ERROR_TIMEOUT.

<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>
### 3.1.6 Other Local Events

The Service Witness Protocol is driven by a series of higher-layer triggered events in the following categories:

- A resource being enabled or disabled.
- A request for a client to move to another resource.
- The ownership of a share moving between resources.
- An IP address being added, removed, enabled, or disabled.
<a id="Section_3.1.6.1"></a>
#### 3.1.6.1 Server Application Notifies of an Interface Being Enabled or Disabled

The calling application provides the interface group name, [**IPv4**](#gt_internet-protocol-version-4-ipv4) and/or [**IPv6**](#gt_internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6) addresses, and state.

The server MUST search for the **Interface** in the **InterfaceList** where **Interface.InterfaceGroupName** matches the application-provided interface group name, and **Interface.IPv4Address** or **Interface.IPv6Address** matches one or both of the application-provided IP addresses.

If a matching entry is found, the server MUST set **Interface.State** to the application-provided state. Then for each entry in the **WitnessRegistrationList** where **WitnessRegistration.NetworkName** matches the application-provided network name and **WitnessRegistration.IPAddress** matches the application-provided IP address, the server SHOULD<8> add a change entry to **WitnessRegistration.PendingChangeNotifications,** with a **ResourceName** of the **Interface**.**InterfaceGroupName** and a **NewState** of the application-provided state.

Else if no matching entry is found, the server MUST create a new **Interface** as follows, and add it to the **InterfaceList**:

- **Interface.InterfaceGroupName**: MUST be set to the application-provided interface group name.
- **Interface.State**: MUST be set to the application-supplied state.
- If the application supplied an IPv4 address, then **Interface.IPv4Address** MUST be set to it, else **Interface.IPv4Address** MUST be set to empty.
- If the application supplied an IPv6 address, then **Interface.IPv6Address** MUST be set to it, else **Interface.IPv6Address** MUST be set to empty.
The server MUST awaken any pending client requests awaiting notification in sections [3.1.4.1](#Section_3.1.4.1) and [3.1.4.4](#Section_3.1.4.4).

<a id="Section_3.1.6.2"></a>
#### 3.1.6.2 Server Application Notifies of a Request to Move to a New Resource

The calling application provides the Witness client name and resource name. The resource name can be an interface group name, an IP address, or a host name.

The server MUST search for all **WitnessRegistrations** in the **WitnessRegistrationList** where **WitnessRegistration.WitnessClientName** matches the application-provided witness client name.

For each **WitnessRegistration** matched, the server MUST create or overwrite the move entry in **WitnessRegistration.PendingMoveNotification,** setting the **Notification.Destination** to the application-provided resource name.

The server MUST awaken any client requests awaiting notification in section [3.1.4.4](#Section_3.1.4.4).

<a id="Section_3.1.6.3"></a>
#### 3.1.6.3 Server Application Notifies of a Change in the Resource that Owns a Share

This notification is applicable only to servers that implement version 2 (0x00020000). The calling application provides the Witness client name, share name, and resource name. The resource name can be an interface group name, an IP address, or a host name.

The server MUST search for all **WitnessRegistrations** in the **WitnessRegistrationList** where **WitnessRegistration.WitnessClientName** matches the application-provided witness client name, **WitnessRegistration.ShareName** matches the application-provided share name, and **WitnessRegistration.ShareNameNotificationRequired** is TRUE.

For each **WitnessRegistration** matched, the server MUST create or overwrite the share move entry in **WitnessRegistration.PendingShareMoveNotification**, setting the **Notification.Destination** to the application-provided resource name.

The server MUST awaken any client requests awaiting notification in section [3.1.4.4](#Section_3.1.4.4).

<a id="Section_3.1.6.4"></a>
#### 3.1.6.4 Server Application Notifies of an IP Address Being Added, Removed, Enabled or Disabled

This notification is applicable only to servers that implement version 2 (0x00020000).The calling application provides the Witness client name and resource name. The resource name can be an interface group name, an IP address, or a host name.

The server MUST search for all **WitnessRegistrations** in the **WitnessRegistrationList** where WitnessRegistration.WitnessClientName matches the application-provided witness client name and **WitnessRegistration.IPNotificationRequired** is TRUE.

For each WitnessRegistration matched, the server MUST create or overwrite the move entry in **WitnessRegistration.PendingIPNotification**, setting the **Notification.ChangeIndication** to the application-provided resource name.

The server MUST awaken any client requests awaiting notification in section [3.1.4.4](#Section_3.1.4.4).

<a id="Section_3.1.6.5"></a>
#### 3.1.6.5 Transport Connection Shutdown

When the RPC transport indicates that an RPC connection with a client has timed out, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.3.3.2.1, the server MUST delete the **WitnessRegistration** entry for that client from the **WitnessRegistrationList**.

<a id="Section_3.2"></a>
## 3.2 Witness Client Details

The client performs requests made to it by the application.

<a id="Section_3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This specification does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behaviors are consistent with that described in this specification.

<a id="Section_3.2.1.1"></a>
#### 3.2.1.1 Global

The client implements the following properties:

- **WitnessRegistrationList**: A list of **WitnessRegistration** initiated by the client to the witness servers. The structure of registration is as specified in section [3.2.1.2](#Section_3.2.1.2).
- **WitnessClientVersion**: The highest Witness protocol version supported by the Witness client. The value MUST be one of those listed in section [1.7](#Section_1.7).
<a id="Section_3.2.1.2"></a>
#### 3.2.1.2 Per WitnessRegistration

The client implements the following properties per witness registration.

- **WitnessServerName**: A null-terminated string that contains the name of the server.
- **IPAddress**: An IP address of a connection target.
- **RegistrationKey**: A unique value assigned by the server for this registration, in the form of context_handle, as specified in section [2.2.1.1](#Section_2.2.1.1).
- **RPCHandle**: An RPC handle used to make requests of the Witness server.
- **WitnessNotifyRequest**: A Boolean that indicates whether a WitnessrAsyncNotify request is outstanding.
If the client implements version 2 (0x00020000) of the Witness protocol, the client implements the following properties:

- **ShareName**: A null-terminated string that contains the share name.
- **NetNameNotificationRequired**: A Boolean when set; indicates that this registration requires notifications based on the *NetName*.
- **ShareNameNotificationRequired**: A Boolean when set; indicates that this registration requires notifications based on the *ShareName*.
- **IPNotificationRequired**: A Boolean when set; indicates that this registration requires notifications based on the IP address changes on the server associated with *NetName*.
- **WitnessServerVersion**: The Witness protocol version supported by the Witness server for this registration.
<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

The client uses non-default behavior for the RPC Call Timeout timer defined in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.3.2.2.2. The timer value that the client uses is implementation-specific.<9>

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

The client MUST initialize WitnessRegistrationList to empty.

The client MUST initialize **WitnessClientVersion** in an implementation-specific manner<10>.

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

After the client is initialized, it is subsequently driven by the higher-layer events triggered by the applications. The following sections describe events triggered by the higher layer.

<a id="Section_3.2.4.1"></a>
#### 3.2.4.1 Application Requests Witness Register

The caller provides the following:

- **NetName**: The name of the application that requests notifications, typically the name to which it has connected.
- **IpAddress**: The IP address of the application that requires to receive asynchronous notification.
- **ShareName**: A string that contains the share name on which the application had requested for notifications, typically the share name to which it has connected. This parameter is only applicable for clients that implement Witness protocol version 2.
- **IsNetNameNotificationRequired**: A Boolean when set; indicates that the application is requesting witness registration to receive notifications based on the **NetName**. This parameter is only applicable for clients that implement Witness protocol version 2.
- **IsShareNameNotificationRequired**: A Boolean when set; indicates that the application requests witness registration to receive notifications based on the **ShareName**. This parameter is only applicable for clients that implement Witness protocol version 2.
- **IsIPNotificationRequired**: A Boolean when set; indicates that the application requests witness registration to receive notifications based on the IP addresses changes on the server associated with **NetName**. This parameter is only applicable for clients that implement Witness protocol version 2.
If the **NetName** parameter is an [**IPv4**](#gt_internet-protocol-version-4-ipv4) address as dotted-decimal with four parts or an [**IPv6**](#gt_internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6) address as 8 hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, the client MUST return an implementation-specific error to the calling application.

The client MUST establish an RPC connection to the Witness Service that runs on the **IPAddress**, as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1) and use implementation-specific<11> values for authentication level and authentication service. If the connection is not established, the error result MUST be returned to the caller.

The client MUST call the **WitnessrGetInterfaceList** method, provide the RPC handle returned from the previous step as the *Handle* input parameter, and subsequently close the RPC handle. If the server returns an error, the client MUST return the same error code to the caller.

If the server returns STATUS_SUCCESS, the client MUST select an Interface returned in the WITNESS_INTERFACE_LIST where the INTERFACE_WITNESS flag is set in the **Flags** field and **State** is AVAILABLE.

If **WitnessClientVersion** is 0x00020000, the client MUST create a new **WitnessRegistration** entry in **WitnessRegistrationList** and set **WitnessRegistration**.**WitnessServerVersion** to the **Version** value returned in the **WitnessrGetInterfaceList** response and set **WitnessRegistration.IpAddress** to the *IpAddress*.

The client MUST establish an RPC Connection to the Witness Service that runs on the selected Interface, as specified in section 2.1 and use implementation-specific<12> values for authentication level and authentication service. If the **IPv4** flag is set, the address in **Interface.IPv4** SHOULD be used for the connection. If the **IPv6** flag is set, the address in **Interface.IPv6** SHOULD be used for the connection. If the connection is not established, the error result MUST be returned to the caller.

If **WitnessClientVersion** is 0x00020000, and if **IsShareNameNotificationRequired** or **IsIPNotificationRequired** provided by the application is TRUE, the client MUST call the RPC **WitnessrRegisterEx** method on the resulting RPC handle, and provide the following values:

- **WitnessClientVersion** for the *Version* parameter
- **NetName** for the *NetName* parameter
- **ShareName** for the *ShareName* parameter
- **IpAddress** for the *IpAddress* parameter
- A name to be used to identify the client<13> for **ClientComputerName**
- If **IsIPNotificationRequired** is TRUE, 0x00000001 for **Flags**; otherwise 0x00000000 for **Flags**.
- An implementation-specific time out value for the **KeepAliveTimeout** parameter.<14>
If the server returns an error, the client MUST retry the registration and use other entries returned by the server for the **WitnessrGetInterfaceList** response. If all the entries are exhausted, the client MUST again call the **WitnessrGetInterfaceList** method as specified earlier. The client SHOULD<15> retry this registration sequence until it gets STATUS_SUCCESS from the server. If the server returns STATUS_SUCCESS, the client MUST update **WitnessRegistration** entry with the following values:

- **WitnessServerName**: This value MUST be set to the *NetName* parameter.
- **ShareName**: This value MUST be set to *ShareName* parameter.
- **RegistrationKey**: This value MUST be set to the value in the *ppContext* parameter.
- **RPCHandle**: This value MUST be set to the RPC handle used in the previous step.
- **WitnessNotifyRequest**: This value MUST be set to FALSE.
- **NetNameNotificationRequired**: This value MUST be set to TRUE.
- **ShareNameNotificationRequired**: This value MUST be set to TRUE if **IsShareNameNotificationRequired** is TRUE; otherwise set to FALSE.
- **IPNotificationRequired**: This value MUST be set to TRUE if **IsIPNotificationRequired** is TRUE; otherwise set to FALSE.
Otherwise, the client MUST call the RPC **WitnessrRegister** method on the resulting RPC handle, provid 0x00010001 for **Version**, **NetName**, **IpAddress**, and a name to be used to identify the client<16>, as input parameters. If the server returns an error, the client MUST retry the registration and use other entries returned by the server for the **WitnessrGetInterfaceList** response. If all the entries are exhausted, the client MUST again call the **WitnessrGetInterfaceList** method as specified earlier. The client SHOULD<17> retry this registration sequence until it gets STATUS_SUCCESS from the server. If the server returns STATUS_SUCCESS, the client MUST create a new **WitnessRegistration** entry with the following values, insert the entry in **WitnessRegistrationList**, and return success to the caller:

- **WitnessServerName:** This value MUST be set to the *NetName* parameter.
- **IPAddress:** This value MUST be set to the *IpAddress* parameter.
- **RegistrationKey:** This value MUST be set to the value in the *ppContext* parameter.
- **WitnessNotifyRequest:** This value MUST be set to FALSE.
- **RPCHandle:** This value MUST be set to the RPC handle used in the previous step.
- If **WitnessClientVersion** is 0x00020000, **ShareName** MUST be set to NULL, **NetNameNotificationRequired** MUST be set to TRUE, **ShareNameNotificationRequired** MUST be set to FALSE, and **IPNotificationRequiredRequired** MUST be set to FALSE.
The client MUST return success to the caller.

<a id="Section_3.2.4.2"></a>
#### 3.2.4.2 Application Requests Witness Event Notification

The caller provides the following:

- **NetName**: The name of the application that requests notifications, typically the name to which it has connected.
- **IpAddress**: The IP address of the application that requires to receive asynchronous notification.
- **ShareName**: A string that contains the share name of the application that requests notifications, typically the share name to which it has connected. This parameter is only applicable for clients that implement Witness protocol version 2.
- **IsNetNameNotificationRequired**: A Boolean when set; indicates that the application had requested witness registration to receive notifications based on the **NetName**. This parameter is only applicable for clients that implement Witness protocol version 2.
- **IsShareNameNotificationRequired**: A Boolean when set; indicates that the application had requested witness registration to receive notifications based on the **ShareName**. This parameter is only applicable for clients that implement Witness protocol version 2.
- **IsIPNotificationRequired**: A Boolean when set; indicates that the application had requested witness registration to receive notifications based on the IP addresses changes on the server associated with **NetName**. This parameter is only applicable for clients that implement Witness protocol version 2.
If **WitnessClientVersion** is 0x00020000, the client MUST locate the **WitnessRegistration** entry in the **WitnessRegistrationList** where **WitnessRegistration.WitnessServerName** matches **NetName**, **WitnessRegistration.WitnessShareName** matches **ShareName**, **WitnessRegistration.IPAddress** matches **IPAddress**, **WitnessRegistration.NetNameNotificationRequired** matches **IsNetNameNotificationRequired**, **WitnessRegistration.ShareNameNotificationRequired** matches **IsShareNameNotificationRequired**, and **WitnessRegistration.IPNotificationRequired** matches **IsIPNotificationRequired**.

If **WitnessClientVersion** is 0x00010001, the client MUST locate a **WitnessRegistration** entry in the **WitnessRegistrationList** where **WitnessRegistration.WitnessServerName** matches the application-provided **NetName** and **WitnessRegistration.IPAddress** matches the application-provided **IPAddress**.

If no matching entry is found, or if the **WitnessRegistration.WitnessNotifyRequest** is TRUE, the client MUST stop processing and return an implementation-defined local error to the caller.

The client MUST set **WitnessRegistration.WitnessNotifyRequest** to TRUE.

The client MUST call the **WitnessrAsyncNotify** method, on **WitnessRegistration.RPCHandle,** and pass **WitnessRegistration.RegistrationKey** as *pContext*.

When the server replies, if **WitnessClientVersion** is 0x00020000 and the status indicates ERROR_TIMEOUT, the client MUST call the **WitnessrAsyncNotify** method as specified earlier.

Otherwise, the client MUST set **WitnessRegistration.WitnessNotifyRequest** to FALSE.

The status and any received RESP_ASYNC_NOTIFY result obtained from the server in the previous step MUST be returned to the caller.

<a id="Section_3.2.4.3"></a>
#### 3.2.4.3 Application Requests Witness UnRegister

The caller provides the following:

- **NetName**: The name of the application that requests to be unregistered, typically the name to which it has previously registered.
- **IpAddress**: The IP address on which the application previously registered to receive asynchronous notification.
- **ShareName**: A string that contains the share name of the application that requests notifications, typically the share name to which it has connected. This parameter is only applicable for clients that implement Witness protocol version 2.
- **IsNetNameNotificationRequired**: A Boolean when set; indicates that the application had requested witness registration to receive notifications based on the **NetName**. This parameter is only applicable for clients that implement Witness protocol version 2.
- **IsShareNameNotificationRequired**: A Boolean when set; indicates that the application had requested witness registration to receive notifications based on the **ShareName**. This parameter is only applicable for clients that implement Witness protocol version 2.
- **IsIPNotificationRequired**: A Boolean when set; indicates that the application had requested witness registration to receive notifications based on the IP addresses changes on the server associated with **NetName**. This parameter is only applicable for clients that implement Witness protocol version 2.
If **WitnessClientVersion** is 0x00020000, the client MUST locate the **WitnessRegistration** entry in the **WitnessRegistrationList** where **WitnessRegistration.WitnessServerName** matches **NetName**, **WitnessRegistration.WitnessShareName** matches **ShareName**, **WitnessRegistration.IPAddress** matches **IPAddress**, **WitnessRegistration.NetNameNotificationRequired** matches **IsNetNameNotificationRequired**, **WitnessRegistration.ShareNameNotificationRequired** matches **IsShareNameNotificationRequired**, and **WitnessRegistration.IPNotificationRequired** matches **IsIPNotificationRequired**.

If **WitnessClientVersion** is 0x00010001, the client MUST locate a **WitnessRegistration** entry in the **WitnessRegistrationList** where **WitnessRegistration.WitnessServerName** matches the application-provided NetName and **WitnessRegistration.IPAddress** matches the application-provided **IPAddress**.

If no matching entry is found, or if the **WitnessRegistration.WitnessNotifyRequest** is TRUE, the client MUST stop processing and return an implementation-defined local error to the caller.

If **WitnessClientVersion** is 0x00020000, the client SHOULD<18> call the WitnessrUnRegisterEx method, on the **WitnessRegistration.RPCHandle**, and pass the **WitnessRegistration.RegistrationKey** as the context.

If **WitnessClientVersion** is 0x00010001, the client MUST call the WitnessrUnRegister method, on the **WitnessRegistration.RPCHandle**, and pass the **WitnessRegistration.RegistrationKey** as the context.

If the server returns an error, the client MUST return the same error code to the caller. If the server returns STATUS_SUCCESS, the client MUST close **WitnessRegistration.RPCHandle**, remove the **WitnessRegistration** from **WitnessRegistrationList**, and return STATUS_SUCCESS to the caller.

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Timer Events

Upon the expiration of RPC Call Timeout Timer, as specified in section [3.2.2](#Section_3.2.2), the client MUST close the RPC connection to the server and release the binding handle.

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

This protocol allows any user to connect to the server; therefore, any security weakness in the server implementation could be exploitable. The server implementation ought to enforce security on each method.

<a id="Section_5.2"></a>
## 5.2 Index of Security Parameters

This protocol allows any user to establish a connection to the RPC server as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).

# 6 Appendix A: Full IDL

For ease of implementation the full IDL is provided below, where "ms-dtyp.idl" refers to the IDL found in [MS-DTYP](#Section_2.2.1) Appendix A. The syntax uses the IDL syntax extensions defined in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.2.4 and 3.1.1.5.1. For example, as noted in [MS-RPCE] section 2.2.4.9, a pointer_default declaration is not required and pointer_default(unique) is assumed.

The **MessageBuffer** field in the RESP_ASYNC_NOTIFY structure contains either a RESOURCE_CHANGE or an IPADDR_INFO_LIST structure. See sections [2.2.2.3](#Section_2.2.2.3) and [2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2) for details.

- Windows Server 2022 operating system
- Windows 11 operating system
- Windows Server 2025 operating system
Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 2.2.2.1: Windows Server 2012 operating system and later set the undefined **Flags** field bits to arbitrary values.

<2> Section 3.1.3: Windows Server 2012 sets this value to 0x00010001. Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system and later set this value to 0x00020000.

<3> Section 3.1.4: Windows Server 2022 and earlier do not support this opnum and return RPC_S_PROCNUM_OUT_OF_RANGE when called.

<4> Section 3.1.4: If the authentication level is not RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY or RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_INTEGRITY, Windows Server 2012 operating system and later will fail the call with ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.

Windows Server 2012 operating system and later will fail the call with ERROR_NOT_AUTHENTICATED if the authentication service is not equal to one of the following values:

- RPC_C_AUTHN_GSS_KERBEROS
- RPC_C_AUTHN_GSS_NEGOTIATE
- RPC_C_AUTHN_WINNT
<5> Section 3.1.4.3: Windows Server 2012 operating system operating system fail the request with ERROR_NOT_FOUND.

<6> Section 3.1.4.6: Windows Server 2022 and earlier do not support this opnum and return RPC_S_PROCNUM_OUT_OF_RANGE when called.

<7> Section 3.1.5.1: Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system and later server use a 30-second time-out.

<8> Section 3.1.6.1: Windows-based servers will send a single notification for NetNames that are aliases of each other.

<9> Section 3.2.2: Windows 8.1 operating system and later and Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system and later use a default of 180 seconds.

<10> Section 3.2.3: Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 clients set **WitnessClientVersion** to 0x00010001; Windows 8.1 operating system and later and Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system and later clients set **WitnessClientVersion** to 0x00020000.

<11> Section 3.2.4.1: By default, Windows 8 operating system and later and Windows Server 2012 operating system and later set the authentication level tospecify RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_INTEGRITY and the authentication service to RPC_C_AUTHN_GSS_NEGOTIATE.

Windows 10 v1607 operating system and later and Windows Server 2016 and later compose Service Principal Name (SPN) in the format, e.g., “CIFS/<ClusterNetworkName>”, as specified in [[SPNNAMES]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90532) to be passed to the authentication layer. Windows 10 v1511 operating system and earlier and Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier, obtain the SPN in the format, e.g., “node@contoso.com”, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.2.1.3.4.

<12> Section 3.2.4.1: By default, Windows 8 operating system and later and Windows Server 2012 operating system and later set the authentication level to RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_INTEGRITY and the authentication service to RPC_C_AUTHN_GSS_NEGOTIATE.

<13> Section 3.2.4.1: Windows uses the [**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**](#gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn) of the local computer to identify the client.

<14> Section 3.2.4.1: Windows 8.1 operating system and later and Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system and later use a default **KeepAliveTime** value of 120 seconds.

<15> Section 3.2.4.1: Windows clients retry the registration every 60 seconds.

<16> Section 3.2.4.1: Windows uses the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the local computer to identify the client.
