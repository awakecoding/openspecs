# 1 Introduction

This specification defines the .NET Binary Format: XML Data Structure, which is a binary format that can represent many [**XML**](#gt_xml) documents, as specified in [[XML1.0]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90599).

This purpose of the format is to reduce the processing costs associated with XML documents by encoding an XML document in fewer bytes than the same document encoded in [**UTF-8**](#gt_utf-8), as specified in [[RFC2279]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90331).

Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_base64-encoding"></a>
**base64 encoding**: A binary-to-text encoding scheme whereby an arbitrary sequence of bytes is converted to a sequence of printable ASCII characters, as described in [[RFC4648]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90487).

<a id="gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc"></a>
**Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**: A high-precision atomic time standard that approximately tracks Universal Time (UT). It is the basis for legal, civil time all over the Earth. Time zones around the world are expressed as positive and negative offsets from UTC. In this role, it is also referred to as Zulu time (Z) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). In these specifications, all references to UTC refer to the time at UTC-0 (or GMT).

<a id="gt_dictionarystring"></a>
**DictionaryString**: A structure defined in [MC-NBFX] section 2.1.4 that uses a [**MultiByteInt31**](#gt_multibyteint31) to refer to a [**string**](#gt_string).

<a id="gt_little-endian"></a>
**little-endian**: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the least significant byte stored in the memory location with the lowest address.

<a id="gt_multibyteint31"></a>
**MultiByteInt31**: A structure defined in [MC-NBFX] section 2.1.2 that encodes small integer values in fewer bytes than large integer values.

<a id="gt_record"></a>
**record**: The fundamental unit of information in the .NET Binary Format: XML Data Structure encoded as a variable length series of bytes. [MC-NBFX] section 2 specifies the format for each type of [**record**](#gt_record).

<a id="gt_string"></a>
**string**: A structure that represents a set of characters ([MC-NBFX](#Section_94c66ea1e79a4364af881fa7fef2cc33) section 2.1.3).

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and RPC objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the UUID.

<a id="gt_utc-coordinated-universal-time"></a>
**UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)**: A high-precision atomic time standard that approximately tracks Universal Time (UT). It is the basis for legal, civil time all over the Earth. Time zones around the world are expressed as positive and negative offsets from UTC. In this role, it is also referred to as Zulu time (Z) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). In these specifications, all references to UTC refer to the time at UTC–0 (or GMT).

<a id="gt_utf-16"></a>
**UTF-16**: A standard for encoding Unicode characters, defined in the Unicode standard, in which the most commonly used characters are defined as double-byte characters. Unless specified otherwise, this term refers to the UTF-16 encoding form specified in [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) section 3.9.

<a id="gt_utf-8"></a>
**UTF-8**: A byte-oriented standard for encoding Unicode characters, defined in the Unicode standard. Unless specified otherwise, this term refers to the UTF-8 encoding form specified in [UNICODE5.0.0/2007] section 3.9.

<a id="gt_xml"></a>
**XML**: The Extensible Markup Language, as described in [[XML1.0]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90599).

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.2"></a>
## 1.2 References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the [Errata](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=850906).

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

The .NET Binary Format: XML Data Structure is used to efficiently represent [**XML**](#gt_xml) 1.0 documents, as specified in [[XML1.0]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90599).

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Protocols and Other Structures

The .NET Binary Format: XML Data Structure is extended by the NET Binary Format: SOAP Data Structure, as described in [MC-NBFS](../MC-NBFS/MC-NBFS.md), and the .NET Binary Format: SOAP Extension, as described in [MC-NBFSE](../MC-NBFSE/MC-NBFSE.md).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Applicability Statement

The .NET Binary Format: XML Data Structure is a general-purpose way to represent an [**XML**](#gt_xml) document that offers many benefits in terms of reduced size and processing costs, but at the expense of human readability. However, the .NET Binary Format: XML Data Structure is capable of representing only a subset of information described by an XML information set (infoset), as described in [[XML-INFOSET]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=95109). It does not represent all syntactic aspects of an XML document encoded textually.

Some constructs have more than one form, of which the .NET Binary Format for XML Data Structure supports one form. For example, the standard (short) form of an empty element is not supported, but the more general form (with open and close tags) is supported.

<element/> <!-- Not supported -->

<element></element> <!-- Supported -->

Other constructs are not supported, although a functionally equivalent construct is supported by the .NET Binary Format for XML Data Structure. For example, a CDATA section cannot be encoded; however, a semantically equivalent construct can be encoded.

<element><![CDATA[hello world]]></element> <!-- Not supported -->

<element>hello world</element> <!-- Supported -->

Character references are necessary in textual XML in order to disambiguate document structure from document content. The .NET Binary Format: XML Data Structure uses [**records**](#gt_record) to distinguish between structure and content, making character references unnecessary.

Insignificant spaces in an element or end element are not supported.

<element a = "value" ></element > <!-- Not supported -->

Processing instructions, data type definitions (DTDs), and declarations are not supported and cannot be represented by this format.

The following table identifies the items that are not available in the .NET Binary Format for XML Data Structure.

| Unsupported construct | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Xml Declaration | `<?xml version="1.0">` |
| Processing Instruction | `<?pi?>` |
| DTD | `<!DOCTYPE ...` |
| Character Reference | `<element>&</element>` |
| Empty Element (short form) | `<element/>` |
| CDATA Section | `<element><![CDATA[hello world]]></element>` |
| Insignificant White Space (in or around an element) | `< element a = "value" ></element >` |

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Versioning and Localization

The .NET Binary Format: XML Data Structure has no versioning mechanism. The format contains both [**UTF-16**](#gt_utf-16) [[RFC2781]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90380)-encoded and [**UTF-8**](#gt_utf-8) [[RFC2279]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90331)-encoded [**strings**](#gt_string), and their use is described in section [2](#Section_1.3).

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Vendor-Extensible Fields

[**Records**](#gt_record) in the .NET Binary Format: XML Data Structure that contain [**DictionaryString**](#gt_dictionarystring) structures use integers to represent [**strings**](#gt_string). The producer and consumer of a document encoded in this format have to agree on how to map these integers to strings. This specification does not prescribe how the producer and consumer agree upon or learn about this mapping. Furthermore, the format does not provide a way to encode such information. Any specification that defines this mapping is considered a different format.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Structures

The .NET Binary Format: XML Data Structure is composed of zero or more [**records**](#gt_record), each of which represents some characters in the [**XML**](#gt_xml) document. The complete XML document represented by the format is simply the concatenation of the characters represented by each of the records. The resulting document is not necessarily a valid XML document.

Unless otherwise noted, records can appear in any order.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Common Definitions

This section specifies the basic [**record**](#gt_record) structure and commonly used structures within those records.

Unless otherwise noted, all values MUST be encoded in [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) format.

Unless otherwise noted, the alignment of a record or any of the fields in the record MUST NOT be assumed to be any particular value. The bit position diagrams are provided to indicate relative positions and sizes of fields, but do not indicate alignment.

<a id="Section_2.1.1"></a>
### 2.1.1 Record

Each [**record**](#gt_record) is encoded as follows.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-7: "RecordType"
  8-63: "Record (variable)"
```

**RecordType (1 byte):** A single byte that identifies the type of record.

**Record (variable):** Dependent upon RecordType.

The following table shows the mapping for each RecordType. The RecordType MUST be one of the values listed in this table. The format for each record is further detailed after the table.

### 2.1.3 String

The String structure describes a set of characters encoded in [**UTF-8**](#gt_utf-8), as specified in [[RFC2279]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90331).

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "Length (variable)"
  64-127: "Bytes (variable)"
```

**Length (variable):** This is the length in bytes of the [**string**](#gt_string) when encoded in UTF-8, as specified in [RFC2279], and MUST be encoded using [**MultiByteInt31**](#gt_multibyteint31). For more information on MultiByteInt31 see section [2.1.2](#Section_2.1.2).

**Bytes (variable):** These are the bytes that constitute the string and MUST be encoded in UTF-8, as specified in [RFC2279].

For example, the string "abc" is encoded as 4 bytes.

0x03 0x61 0x62 0x63

This specification places no restrictions on the set of characters that can be encoded here.

<a id="Section_2.1.4"></a>
### 2.1.4 DictionaryString

The DictionaryString structure describes a reference to a set of characters.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "Value (variable)"
```

**Value (variable):** An integer value encoded using [**MultiByteInt31**](#gt_multibyteint31). For more information on MultiByteInt31 see section [2.1.2](#Section_2.1.2). The [**string**](#gt_string) that the integer refers to is determined by the producer and consumer of the document.

This specification places no restrictions on the set of characters that can be referenced.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Records

This section describes the format of each of the [**records**](#gt_record) noted earlier, and the characters they represent. The character representations of records are case sensitive and MUST use the exact casing depicted.

Records can largely be grouped into four categories:

- [Element Records](#Section_2.2.1)
- [Attribute Records](#Section_2.2.2)
- [Text Records](#Section_2.2.3)
- [Miscellaneous Records](#Section_2.3)
For reference, the record type is shown in hex following each record.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Element Records

This section describes the different kinds of element [**records**](#gt_record). An element record is any record with a record type. See the following tables from 0x40 to 0x77 inclusive. Element records represent different kinds of elements in the [**XML**](#gt_xml) document.

<a id="Section_2.2.1.1"></a>
#### 2.2.1.1 ShortElement Record (0x40)

This structure represents an element without a prefix.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "Name (variable)"
  64-127: "Attributes (variable)"
```

**Name (variable):** The name of the element encoded using [**String**](#gt_string). The length of this String MUST be nonzero. The name MUST NOT be "xmlns".

**Attributes (variable):** Zero or more attribute [**records**](#gt_record).

For example, if name refers to the string "element" and attributes refers to { xmlns="http://tempuri.org" }, this record is interpreted as the following characters.

<element_xmlns="http://tempuri.org">

Note that the underscore is intended to represent a single ASCII white-space character (32).

<a id="Section_2.2.1.2"></a>
#### 2.2.1.2 Element Record (0x41)

This structure represents an element with a prefix.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "Prefix (variable)"
  64-127: "Name (variable)"
  128-191: "Attributes (variable)"
```

**Prefix (variable):** The prefix of the element encoded using [**String**](#gt_string). The length of this String MUST be nonzero. The name MUST NOT be "xmlns".

**Name (variable):** The name of the element encoded using String. The length of this String MUST be nonzero. The name MUST NOT be "xmlns".

**Attributes (variable):** Zero or more attribute [**records**](#gt_record).

For example, if prefix refers to the string "prefix", name refers to the string "element", and attributes refers to { xmlns:prefix="http://tempuri.org" }, this record is interpreted as the following characters.

<prefix:element_xmlns:prefix="http://tempuri.org">

Note that the underscore is intended to represent a single ASCII white-space character (32).

<a id="Section_2.2.1.3"></a>
#### 2.2.1.3 ShortDictionaryElement Record (0x42)

This structure represents an element without a prefix.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "Name (variable)"
  64-127: "Attributes (variable)"
```

**Name (variable):** The name of the element encoded using [**DictionaryString**](#gt_dictionarystring). The length of this [**String**](#gt_string) MUST be nonzero. The name MUST NOT be "xmlns".

**Attributes (variable):** Zero or more attribute [**records**](#gt_record).

For example, if name refers to the String "element" and attributes refers to { xmlns="http://tempuri.org" }, this record is interpreted as the following characters.

<element_xmlns="http://tempuri.org">

Note that the underscore is intended to represent a single ASCII white-space character (32).

<a id="Section_2.2.1.4"></a>
#### 2.2.1.4 DictionaryElement Record (0x43)

This structure represents an element with a prefix.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "Prefix (variable)"
  64-127: "Name (variable)"

**Name (variable):** The name of the element encoded using [**Dictionary**](#gt_dictionarystring). The length of this String MUST be nonzero. The name MUST NOT be "xmlns".

**Attributes (variable):** Zero or more attribute [**records**](#gt_record).

For example, if prefix refers to the string "prefix", name refers to the string "element", and attributes refers to { xmlns:prefix="http://tempuri.org" }, this record is interpreted as the following characters.

<prefix:element_xmlns:prefix="http://tempuri.org">

Note that the underscore is intended to represent a single ASCII white-space character (32).

#### PrefixDictionaryElement[A-Z] Record (0x44-0x5D)

This structure represents an element with a single lowercase letter prefix.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "Name (variable)"
  64-127: "Attributes (variable)"
```

**Name (variable):** The name of the element encoded using [**DictionaryString**](#gt_dictionarystring). The length of this [**String**](#gt_string) MUST be nonzero. The name MUST NOT be "xmlns".

**Attributes (variable):** Zero or more attribute [**records**](#gt_record).

The prefix for this attribute is determined by the record type.

For example, if the record type is PrefixDictionaryElementB, name refers to the string "element", and attributes refers to { xmlns:b="http://tempuri.org" }, this record is interpreted as the following characters.

<b:element_xmlns:b="http://tempuri.org">

Note that the underscore is intended to represent a single ASCII white-space character (32).

#### PrefixElement[A-Z] Record (0x5E-0x77)

This structure represents an element with a single lowercase letter prefix.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "Name (variable)"

**Attributes (variable):** Zero or more attribute [**records**](#gt_record).

The prefix for this attribute is determined by the record type.

For example, if the record type is PrefixElementB, name refers to the string "element", and attributes refers to { xmlns:b="http://tempuri.org" }, this record is interpreted as the following characters.

<b:element_xmlns:b="http://tempuri.org">

Note that the underscore is intended to represent a single ASCII white-space character (32).

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 Attribute Records

This section describes the different kinds of attribute [**records**](#gt_record). An attribute record is any record with a record type (see Table 1) from 0x04 to 0x3F inclusive. An attribute record MUST follow another attribute record or an element record. Attribute records represent different kinds of attributes in the [**XML**](#gt_xml) document.

- MM is the two-digit representation of the month starting at "01".
- dd is the two-digit representation of the day of the month starting at "01".
- HH is the two-digit representation of the hour of the day starting at "00".
- mm is the two-digit representation of the minute of the hour starting at "00".
- ss is the two-digit representation of the second of the minute starting at "00".

#### 2.2.3.13 Chars8Text Record (0x98)

This structure represents attribute or element content.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-7: "Length"
  8-63: "Bytes (variable)"
```

**Bytes (variable):** The string encoded as UTF-8 [RFC2279] bytes.

For example, if length is 3 and bytes = { 0x41, 0x42, 0x43 }, this [**record**](#gt_record) is interpreted as the following characters.

abc

UTF-8 [RFC2279]-encoded sequences MUST be fully formed. There MUST not be any partial UTF-8 [RFC2279] sequences within a record. UTF-8 [RFC2279] sequences that expand to a low surrogate character MUST be paired with a high surrogate character. (For more information on surrogate characters, see [[UNICODE]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90550).)

<a id="Section_2.2.3.13.1"></a>
##### 2.2.3.13.1 Character Escaping

Characters MUST be interpreted as minimally escaped. This means that a character MUST be interpreted as escaped only if it is required to be escaped for the character to be legal at this point in the [**XML**](#gt_xml) document. Characters considered illegal by XML MUST be considered escaped.

If a character must be interpreted as escaped and it is one of the characters in the first column of the following table, it MUST be interpreted as the characters in the second column.

| Character | Interpret as |
| --- | --- |
| " | &quot |
| & | &amp |
| < | &lt |
| > | &gt |
| ' | &apos |

Otherwise if a character does not fall within the legal character ranges defined in XML, the character MUST be interpreted as the following characters.

&#digits;

where digits is the value of the character expressed in base 10 characters. There MUST NOT be any unnecessary leading zeros in this representation.

For example, if length is 6, and bytes = { 0x22, 0x26, 0x3C, 0x3E, 0x27, 0x00 }, and this [**record**](#gt_record) is within an element, this record is interpreted as the following characters.

"&<>' 

The ampersand (&), less than sign (<), and greater than sign (>) are required by XML to be escaped in element content; quotation marks (") and single quotation marks (') are not required to be escaped. The zero (0) is invalid in XML, but MUST be interpreted as appearing in its escaped form.

If the same record appeared as an attribute, this record is interpreted as the following characters.

"&<>' 

<a id="Section_2.2.3.31"></a>
#### 2.2.3.31 *TextWithEndElement Records

These [**records**](#gt_record) are a simple optimization intended to reduce the size of the document.

[**XML**](#gt_xml) of the form

<value>123</value>

can be represented by three records in the following format.

ShortElement(name="value")

Chars8Text(value="123")

EndElement

By marking the Text record to indicate that an EndElement follows, the number of records can be reduced.

ShortElement(name="value")

Chars8TextWithEndElement(value="123")

Any record with the name in the form *TextWithEndElement MUST be interpreted as a sequence of two records: A *Text record followed by an EndElement record.

For example, the Int32TextWithEndElement record is interpreted as an Int32TextRecord followed by an EndElement record and must behave identically.

These records MUST NOT be used inside Attribute records.

## 2.3 Miscellaneous Records

This section lists the few remaining [**records**](#gt_record) that are not element, attribute, or text records.

<a id="Section_2.3.1"></a>
### 2.3.1 EndElement Record (0x01)

This structure represents an end element. There are no additional fields for this [**record**](#gt_record) beyond the record type.

This record MUST be interpreted as the end element of the most recent open element and there MUST exist such an element. For example, if the most recent element record corresponded to the following start element

<ENV:envelope>

then this record is interpreted as the following characters.

</ENV:envelope>

Additionally, this record MUST be interpreted as closing the most recently open element.

<a id="Section_2.3.2"></a>
### 2.3.2 Comment Record (0x02)

This structure represents a comment.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "Value (variable)"
```

**Value (variable):** The text of the comment encoded using [**String**](#gt_string).

For example, if the value field represents the string "comment", this [**record**](#gt_record) is interpreted as the following characters.

<!--comment-->

<a id="Section_2.3.3"></a>
### 2.3.3 Array Record (0x03)

This structure represents a series of repeating elements.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-63: "Element (variable)"
  64-71: "End Element"
  72-79: "Record Type"
  80-127: "Length (variable)"
  128-191: "Data (variable)"
```

**Element (variable):** An Element [**record**](#gt_record).

**End Element (1 byte):** An EndElement record.

**Record Type (1 byte):** The record type of the element content. This MUST be one of the values in the following table.

**Length (variable):** The number of elements, encoded with [**MultiByteInt31**](#gt_multibyteint31). This MUST not be zero.

**Data (variable):** The values for the elements, encoded according to RecordType.

The size of Data is the Length multiplied by the size of the RecordType according to the following table.

| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable | 0xB5 | BoolTextWithEndElement 1 |
| Variable | 0x8B | Int16TextWithEndElement 2 |
| Variable | 0x8D | Int32TextWithEndElement 4 |
| Variable | 0x8F | Int64TextWithEndElement 8 |
| Variable | 0x91 | FloatTextWithEndElement 4 |
| Variable | 0x93 | DoubleTextWithEndElement 8 |
| Variable | 0x95 | DecimalTextWithEndElement 16 |
| Variable | 0x97 | DateTimeTextWithEndElement 8 |
| Variable | 0xAF | TimeSpanTextWithEndElement 8 |
| Variable | 0XB1 | UuidTextWithEndElement 16 |

This record MUST be interpreted as the characters resulting from expanding this record into a series of records where the Element record is repeated for each value.

For example, if the Element and Attribute records expand to the following

<item xmlns='http://tempuri.org'>

and RecordType is Int32TextWithEndElement, and Length = 3, and Values = { 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 }, this is interpreted as the following characters.

<item xmlns='http://tempuri.org'>1</item>

<item xmlns='http://tempuri.org'>2</item>

<item xmlns='http://tempuri.org'>3</item>

Since Length is 3 and the size of Int32TextWithEndElement is 4 according to the table, the size of Data is 12.. Values consist of 3 integer values, each encoded in 4 bytes as demanded by Int32TextWithEndElement. (As discussed in section [2.2.3.31](#Section_2.2.3.31), this MUST be interpreted as Int32Text followed by EndElement.)

Note that there is no carriage return or line feed included here, and the line break shown is for readability only.

# 3 Structure Examples

The following table provides an example of almost every [**record**](#gt_record) type, and shows the character interpretations.

The record column shows each of the record types. The Type column shows the value of the record type, which is taken from Table 1. The Bytes column show a complete [**XML**](#gt_xml) document encoded in this format that highlights the use of the record type. Because the record type is not always first, its location in the sequence of bytes is highlighted. The Chars column shows the same data from the Bytes column, formatted as characters. The final column, Characters represented, shows the XML interpretation of the bytes.

**Note** Records that refer to [**strings**](#gt_string) outside the document are shown as "strXXX" where XXX is the integer value.

As described in section [2](#Section_1.3), the document is represented by the concatenation of the characters represented by the records. No additional characters can be inserted.

For example, if the document consists of the records

ShortElement(name="element", attributes={})

Int32Text(value=1234)

FalseText

EndElement

then the characters represented by these records are interpreted as the following.

<element>1234false</element>

# 4 Security Considerations

Ultimately, this format simply represents a textual [**XML**](#gt_xml) document. Implementations that process XML documents represented by this format have to guard against the same kinds of threats that occur when processing equivalent, textually encoded XML documents.

In many [**records**](#gt_record), the length of the data precedes the data itself. Implementations have to avoid allocating memory based solely on the length in order to guard against malformed or malicious records.

# 5 Appendix A: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

This document specifies version-specific details in the Microsoft .NET Framework. For information about which versions of .NET Framework are available in each released Windows product or as supplemental software, see [MS-NETOD](#Section_1.3) section 4.

- Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0
- Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8
Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.
