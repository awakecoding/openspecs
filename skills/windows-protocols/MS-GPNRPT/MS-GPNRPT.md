# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Name Resolution Policy Table (NRPT) Group Policy Data Extension, an extension to Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding [MS-GPREG](../MS-GPREG/MS-GPREG.md). The NRPT Group Policy Data Extension provides a mechanism for an administrator to control any [**Name Resolution Policy**](#gt_name-resolution-policy) behavior on a [**client**](#gt_client) by using Group Policy settings.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses LDAP as its primary access protocol. [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) stores information about a variety of objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md). [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is either deployed as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), which are both described in [MS-ADOD](../MS-ADOD/MS-ADOD.md): Active Directory Protocols Overview.

<a id="gt_administrative-template"></a>
**administrative template**: A file associated with a [**Group Policy Object (GPO)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) that combines information on the syntax of registry-based policy settings with human-readable descriptions of the settings, as well as other information.

<a id="gt_advanced-encryption-standard-aes"></a>
**Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**: A block cipher that supersedes the [**Data Encryption Standard (DES)**](#gt_data-encryption-standard-des). AES can be used to protect electronic data. The AES algorithm can be used to encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) information. Encryption converts data to an unintelligible form called ciphertext; decrypting the ciphertext converts the data back into its original form, called plaintext. AES is used in symmetric-key cryptography, meaning that the same key is used for the encryption and decryption operations. It is also a block cipher, meaning that it operates on fixed-size blocks of plaintext and ciphertext, and requires the size of the plaintext as well as the ciphertext to be an exact multiple of this block size. AES is also known as the Rijndael symmetric encryption algorithm [[FIPS197]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89870).

<a id="gt_certification-authority-ca"></a>
**certification authority (CA)**: A third party that issues public key certificates. Certificates serve to bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide whether to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust is to be transitive. For more information, see [[RFC3280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90414).

<a id="gt_client"></a>
**client**: A client, also called a client computer, is a computer that receives and applies settings of a [**Group Policy Object (GPO)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo), as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md).

<a id="gt_client-computer"></a>
**client computer**: A computer that receives and applies settings from a [**Group Policy Object (GPO)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo), as specified in [MS-GPOL].

<a id="gt_client-side-extension-guid-cse-guid"></a>
**client-side extension GUID (CSE GUID)**: A [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) that enables a specific client-side extension on the Group Policy client to be associated with policy data that is stored in the logical and physical components of a [**Group Policy Object (GPO)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) on the Group Policy server, for that particular extension.

<a id="gt_data-encryption-standard-des"></a>
**Data Encryption Standard (DES)**: A specification for encryption of computer data that uses a 56-bit key developed by IBM and adopted by the U.S. government as a standard in 1976. For more information see [[FIPS46-3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89872).

<a id="gt_directaccess"></a>
**DirectAccess**: A collection of different component policies, including Name Resolution Policy and IPsec, which allows seamless connectivity to corporate resources when not physically connected to the corporate network.

<a id="gt_domain"></a>
**domain**: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a domain controller (DC) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) service. The domain controller provides authentication of members, creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD](../MS-AUTHSOD/MS-AUTHSOD.md) section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

<a id="gt_domain-name-system-dns"></a>
**Domain Name System (DNS)**: A hierarchical, distributed database that contains mappings of domain names to various types of data, such as IP addresses. DNS enables the location of computers and services by user-friendly names, and it also enables the discovery of other information stored in the database.

<a id="gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn"></a>
**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**: An unambiguous domain name that gives an absolute location in the [**Domain Name System's (DNS)**](#gt_domain-name-system-dns) hierarchy tree, as defined in [[RFC1035]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90264) section 3.1 and [[RFC2181]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=127732) section 11.

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_group-policy-object-gpo"></a>
**Group Policy Object (GPO)**: A collection of administrator-defined specifications of the policy settings that can be applied to groups of computers in a domain. Each GPO includes two elements: an object that resides in the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) for the domain, and a corresponding file system subdirectory that resides on the sysvol DFS share of the Group Policy server for the domain.

<a id="gt_ipv4-address-in-string-format"></a>
**IPv4 address in string format**: A string representation of an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation, as described in [[RFC1123]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90268) section 2.1.

<a id="gt_ipv6-address-in-string-format"></a>
**IPv6 address in string format**: A string representation of an IPv6 address, as described in [[RFC4291]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90464) section 2.2.

<a id="gt_name-resolution-policy"></a>
**Name Resolution Policy**: [**Policy settings**](#gt_policy-setting) that control how [**client**](#gt_client) name resolution is performed for a given [**DNS**](#gt_domain-name-system-dns) domain or hostname.

<a id="gt_name-resolution-policy-table-nrpt"></a>
**Name Resolution Policy Table (NRPT)**: The collection of Name Resolution Policy settings that apply to a given client.

<a id="gt_netbios"></a>
**NetBIOS**: A particular network transport that is part of the LAN Manager protocol suite. [**NetBIOS**](#gt_netbios) uses a broadcast communication style that was applicable to early segmented local area networks. A protocol family including name resolution, datagram, and connection services. For more information, see [[RFC1001]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90260) and [[RFC1002]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90261).

<a id="gt_policy-setting"></a>
**policy setting**: A statement of the possible behaviors of an element of a domain member computer's behavior that can be configured by an administrator.

<a id="gt_punycode"></a>

<a id="gt_registry"></a>
**registry**: A local system-defined database in which applications and system components store and retrieve configuration data. It is a hierarchical data store with lightly typed elements that are logically stored in tree format. Applications use the registry API to retrieve, modify, or delete registry data. The data stored in the registry varies according to the version of the operating system.

<a id="gt_registry-policy-file"></a>
**registry policy file**: A file associated with a [**Group Policy Object (GPO)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) that contains a set of registry-based policy settings.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Protocol Overview (Synopsis)

The Name Resolution Policy Table (NRPT) Group Policy Data Extension provides a mechanism for an administrator to control [**Name Resolution Policy**](#gt_name-resolution-policy) behavior of the [**client**](#gt_client) through Group Policy by using the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding [MS-GPREG](../MS-GPREG/MS-GPREG.md).

<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 Background

The Group Policy: Core Protocol (as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md)) allows [**clients**](#gt_client) to discover and retrieve [**policy settings**](#gt_policy-setting) created by administrators of a [**domain**](#gt_domain). These settings are persisted within [**Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) that are assigned to Policy Target accounts in the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory). On each client, each GPO is interpreted and acted upon by software components known as client plug-ins. The client plug-ins responsible for a given GPO are specified using an attribute on the GPO. This attribute specifies a list of [**globally unique identifier (GUID)**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) lists. The first GUID of each GUID list is referred to as a [**client-side extension GUID (CSE GUID)**](#gt_client-side-extension-guid-cse-guid). Other GUIDs in the GUID list are referred to as [**tool extension GUIDs**](#gt_88ad7745-bee6-47f7-ae98-6fac7c5ef330). For each GPO that is applicable to a client, the client consults the CSE GUIDs listed in the GPO to determine which client plug-in on the client will handle the GPO. The client then invokes the client plug-in to handle the GPO.

[**Registry**](#gt_registry)-based settings are accessible from a GPO through the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding protocol [MS-GPREG](../MS-GPREG/MS-GPREG.md), which is a client plug-in. The protocol provides mechanisms both for administrative tools to obtain metadata about registry-based settings and for clients to obtain applicable registry-based settings.

Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding settings are specified using [**registry policy files**](#gt_registry-policy-file) (as specified in [MS-GPREG] section 2.2.1). An administrative tool uses the information within the [**administrative template**](#gt_administrative-template) to write out a registry policy file and associate it with a GPO. The Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding plug-in on each client reads registry policy files specified by applicable GPOs and applies their contents to its registry.

<a id="Section_1.3.2"></a>
### 1.3.2 Name Resolution Policy Table Extension Encoding Overview

[**Name Resolution Policy Table**](#gt_name-resolution-policy-table-nrpt) policies are configurable from a GPO through the Name Resolution Policy Table Group Policy Data Extension, which uses the {f4d8c39a-f43d-42b4-9bdf-4e48d3044ba1} [**tool extension GUID**](#gt_88ad7745-bee6-47f7-ae98-6fac7c5ef330). The protocol provides mechanisms both for Group Policy administrators to deploy policies and for [**clients**](#gt_client) to obtain the applicable policies to enforce them. The Name Resolution Policy Table component has complex settings not expressible through [**administrative templates**](#gt_administrative-template), and for this reason it implements a custom UI that can author [**registry policy files**](#gt_registry-policy-file) containing the encodings of the settings described in this document. Given that the Name Resolution Policy Table policies are applied to the whole machine, the NRPT Group Policy Data Extension protocol uses the Computer Policy Mode described in [MS-GPREG](../MS-GPREG/MS-GPREG.md) section 1.3.2.

Name Resolution Policy Table policies are applied as follows:

- An administrator invokes a Group Policy Name Resolution Policy Table administrative tool on the administrator's computer to administer a Group Policy Object (GPO) through Group Policy Protocol using the Policy Administration mode, as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 2.2.7. The administrative tool invokes a plug-in specific to Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding so that the administrator can administer the Group Policy: Name Resolution Policy Table Data Structure transported over the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding data. This results in the storage and retrieval of metadata inside a GPO on a Group Policy server. This metadata describes configuration settings to be applied to the [**registry**](#gt_registry) on a client that is affected by the GPO. The administrator views the data and updates it to add a directive to run a command when the [**client computer**](#gt_client-computer) starts up. If they are not already present from a prior update, the [**CSE GUID**](#gt_client-side-extension-guid-cse-guid) and tool extension GUID for Computer Policy Settings for Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding are written to the GPO.
- A client computer affected by that GPO is started (or is connected to the network, if this happens after the client starts), and Group Policy Protocol is invoked by the client to retrieve [**Policy Settings**](#gt_policy-setting) from the Group Policy server. As part of the processing of Group Policy Protocol, the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding's CSE GUID is read from this GPO, and this instructs the client to invoke a Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding plug-in component for Policy Application.
- In processing the Policy Application portion of Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding, the client parses the settings and then saves the settings in the registry on the local computer and notifies the Name Resolution Policy client component. The NRPT policies are stored in local storage.
- The NRPT Group Policy Data Extension is invoked for policy application. To apply the policies, the Name Resolution Policy component parses its previously stored settings in local storage.
<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol depends on the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding (as specified in [MS-GPREG](../MS-GPREG/MS-GPREG.md)) to transport the Name Resolution Policy Table Group Policy Data Extension settings. The protocol also has all the dependencies inherited from Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The prerequisites for this protocol are the same as those for the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding ([MS-GPREG](../MS-GPREG/MS-GPREG.md)).

In addition, a [**client**](#gt_client) needs to have a system/subsystem capable of executing commands at startup/shutdown time because the Computer Policy Mode of the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding is used.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The NRPT Group Policy Data Extension is applicable only while transported under the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding and within the Group Policy: Core Protocol framework. The Group Policy: Name Resolution Policy Table Data Structure is used to express the required [**Name Resolution Policy Table**](#gt_name-resolution-policy-table-nrpt) policy of the [**client**](#gt_client). Settings configured under Group Policy have priority over local settings.

The NRPT Group Policy Data Extension is not used in any other context.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

The Group Policy: Name Resolution Policy Table Data Structure has a policy version (also called schema version), but the protocol currently defines a single version with a value of 1.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Administrative Plug-in Details

The administrative plug-in mediates between the user interface (UI) and a remote data store that contains [**Name Resolution Policy Table**](#gt_name-resolution-policy-table-nrpt) Group Policy extension settings. Its purpose is to receive Name Resolution Policy Table Group Policy information from a UI and to write the same policy information to a remote data store.

The NRPT Group Policy Data Extension administrative plug-in relies on a collection of settings specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2) and stored as a [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) configuration file ([MS-GPREG](../MS-GPREG/MS-GPREG.md) section 2.2) at a remote storage location using the Group Policy: Core Protocol. The administrative plug-in parses and encodes these settings as specified in section 2.2 to perform its functions.

The NRPT Group Policy Data Extension administrative plug-in reads in these settings from the remote storage location and displays them to an administrator through a UI.

An administrator can then use the UI to make further configuration changes, and the NRPT Group Policy Data Extension administrative plug-in will make corresponding changes to the name-value pairs stored in the aforementioned Unicode configuration file following the conventions of the keys specified in section 2.2.

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

The NRPT Group Policy Data Extension administrative plug-in is invoked when an administrator launches the user interface for editing Group Policy settings. The plug-in displays the current settings to the administrator, and when the administrator requests a change in settings, it updates the stored configuration appropriately as specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2), after performing additional checks and actions as noted in this section.

The administrative plug-in SHOULD<23> take measures in its UI to ensure that the user cannot unknowingly set the Name Resolution Policy Table Group Policy settings to an invalid value.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The NRPT Group Policy Data Extension administrative plug-in reads extension-specific data from the remote storage location and will then pass that information to a UI to display the current settings to an administrator.

It will also write the extension-specific configuration data to the remote storage location if the administrator makes any changes to the existing configuration.

Any additional entries in the configuration data that do not pertain to the configuration options specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2), or that are not supported by the particular implementation, MUST be ignored by the plug-in.

<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

Do not transmit passwords or other sensitive data through this protocol. The primary reason for this restriction is that the protocol provides no encryption, and therefore sensitive data transmitted through this protocol can be intercepted easily by an unauthorized user with access to the network carrying the data. For example, if a network administrator configured a Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding setting in a [**GPO**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) to instruct a computer to use a specific password when accessing a certain network resource, this protocol would send that password unencrypted to those computers. A person gaining unauthorized access, intercepting the protocol's network packets in this case, would then discover the password for that resource, which would then be unprotected from the unauthorized person.
