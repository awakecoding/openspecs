# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Remote Desktop Protocol: Plug and Play Devices Virtual Channel Extension to the Remote Desktop Protocol.<1> This protocol is used to redirect Plug and Play (PNP) devices from a [**terminal client**](#gt_terminal-client) to the [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server). This allows the server access to devices that are physically connected to the client as if the device were local to the server.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_device-driver"></a>
**device driver**: The software that the system uses to communicate with a device such as a display, printer, mouse, or communications adapter. An abstraction layer that restricts access of applications to various hardware devices on a given computer system. It is often referred to simply as a "driver".

<a id="gt_device-interface"></a>
**device interface**: A uniform and extensible mechanism that interacts programmatically with applications and the system. A [**device driver**](#gt_device-driver) can expose zero, one, or more than one [**device interfaces**](#gt_device-interface) for a particular device. A [**device interface**](#gt_device-interface) is represented by a [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid).

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_handle"></a>
**handle**: Any token that can be used to identify and access an object such as a device, file, or a window.

<a id="gt_hresult"></a>
**HRESULT**: An integer value that indicates the result or status of an operation. A particular HRESULT can have different meanings depending on the protocol using it. See [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.1 and specific protocol documents for further details.

<a id="gt_inputoutput-io-routines"></a>
**Input/Output (I/O) routines**: A routine defined by an operating system that enables applications to interact with a [**device driver**](#gt_device-driver). Applications use these routines for tasks, such as opening a device, creating a file, reading data from a device, writing data to a device, or sending control codes to a device.

<a id="gt_multisz-string"></a>
**multisz string**: A null-terminated Unicode string composed of other null-terminated strings appended together. For example, a [**multisz string**](#gt_multisz-string) that contains "one", "brown", and "cow" would be represented as three null-terminated strings "one\0", "brown\0", "cow\0" appended together with an additional null appended, as follows: "one\0brown\0cow\0\0".

<a id="gt_remote-device"></a>
**remote device**: A device that is attached to a remote (or client) machine, in contrast to a device physically attached to a machine.

<a id="gt_terminal-client"></a>
**terminal client**: A client of a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server). A terminal client program that runs on the client machine.

<a id="gt_terminal-server"></a>
**terminal server**: A computer on which terminal services is running.

<a id="gt_unicode-string"></a>
**Unicode string**: A Unicode 8-bit string is an ordered sequence of 8-bit units, a Unicode 16-bit string is an ordered sequence of 16-bit code units, and a Unicode 32-bit string is an ordered sequence of 32-bit code units. In some cases, it could be acceptable not to terminate with a terminating null character. Unless otherwise specified, all [**Unicode strings**](#gt_unicode-string) follow the UTF-16LE encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Plug and Play Devices Virtual Channel Extension specifies the communication used to enable the redirection of devices between a [**terminal client**](#gt_terminal-client) and a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server). The restrictions placed on devices that can be redirected using this protocol are specified in section [1.6](#Section_1.6). By redirecting devices from the terminal client to the terminal server, applications running on a server machine can access the [**remote devices**](#gt_remote-device) as if they were local devices. For example, a user can attach an MP3 player device to the terminal client and then synchronize music using a media player application running on the terminal server.

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Plug and Play Devices Virtual Channel Extension consists of two sub-protocols:

- Plug and Play (PNP) Device Info
- Plug and Play (PNP) Device Input/Output (I/O)
<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 PNP Device Info Subprotocol

The [PNP Device Info Subprotocol](#Section_1.3.1) specifies the communication between the [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) client and the terminal server component that handles the creation and removal of [**remote devices**](#gt_remote-device) on the server side. This subprotocol is used to create remote device instances on the server machine that correspond to the physical devices on the client machine. The following illustration shows the PNP Device Info Subprotocol message sequence. This subprotocol uses a dynamic virtual channel named PNPDR for communication between client and server.

![PNP Device Info Subprotocol message sequence](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: PNP Device Info Subprotocol message sequence

This subprotocol consists of a versioning and capabilities negotiation phase, in addition to a device addition and removal phase. The [**terminal client**](#gt_terminal-client) sends the device information to the terminal server, and the terminal server creates the remote device instances that represent the physical devices.

<a id="Section_1.3.2"></a>
### 1.3.2 PNP Device I/O Subprotocol

The [PNP Device I/O Subprotocol](#Section_1.3.2) specifies the communication between the [**terminal client**](#gt_terminal-client) and the [**remote devices**](#gt_remote-device) on the [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server), for handling I/O requests. This subprotocol is used to redirect the I/O calls from applications on the terminal server side to a [**device driver**](#gt_device-driver) on the terminal client side. The following illustration shows a typical PNP Device I/O Subprotocol message sequence. This subprotocol uses a dynamic virtual channel named **FileRedirectorChannel** for communication between client and server.

![PNP Device I/O Subprotocol message sequence](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: PNP Device I/O Subprotocol message sequence

For devices redirected using the [PNP Device Info Subprotocol](#Section_1.3.1), I/O redirection takes place using the PNP Device I/O Subprotocol. The server creates a new subchannel within the **FileRedirectorChannel** main channel for each [CreateFile Request](#Section_2.2.2.3.1). Subsequent I/O operations related to the file created are passed on this subchannel. The server sends the I/O requests to the client on behalf of applications running on the server. The client completes the I/O requests and passes the results back to the server.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Plug and Play Devices Virtual Channel Extension is embedded in a dynamic virtual channel transport, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites and Preconditions

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Plug and Play Devices Virtual Channel Extension operates only after the dynamic virtual channel transport is fully established. If the dynamic virtual channel transport is terminated, the Remote Desktop Protocol: Plug and Play Devices Virtual Channel Extension is also terminated. The protocol is terminated by closing the underlying virtual channel. For details about closing the dynamic virtual channel, see [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) section 3.2.5.2.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Plug and Play Devices Virtual Channel Extension is designed to run within the context of a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) virtual channel established between a client and server. This protocol is applicable when local client Plug and Play devices need to be accessible (redirected) in the remote session hosted on the server.

[**Device drivers**](#gt_device-driver) and applications have to meet the following requirements if they need to be redirected:

- This protocol is not intended for use with devices that require quality-of-service guarantees.
- For redirection to operate properly using this protocol, all communication between devices and applications is routed through the [**I/O routines**](#gt_d509dbdb-f32b-4902-88fe-636121de5245) supported by device drivers. Communication is not routed by any other means, such as shared memory, the registry, or disk files.
- This protocol redirects operating system-specific I/O calls such as Read, Write, IOControl, and CreateFile. Communication between the custom device driver and the application cannot be anything other than these basic calls. If it is, the device cannot be redirected using this protocol.
<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This protocol defines specific messages for versioning and capability negotiations. The following messages are used for such negotiations:

- [Server Version Message](#Section_2.2.1.2.1)
- [Client Version Message](#Section_2.2.1.2.2)
- [Server Capabilities Request Message](#Section_2.2.2.2.1)
- [Client Capabilities Reply Message](#Section_2.2.2.2.2)
<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol uses [**HRESULTs**](#gt_hresult), as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.1. Vendors are free to choose their own values, as long as the C bit (0x20000000) is set, indicating that it is a customer code.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

None.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

This protocol is designed to operate over dynamic virtual channels, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md), using the names PNPDR and FileRedirectorChannel.

One active instance of the PNPDR channel serves as a common control channel for adding and deleting devices. Multiple dynamic connections are established on the FileRedirectorChannel channel—one connection for each create-file request (which establishes a file [**handle**](#gt_handle)) and all corresponding I/O operations made using the file handle.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 PNP Device Info Subprotocol

The messages in the following sections specify the common header and specific messages that make up the PNP Device Info Subprotocol. All multi-byte fields within a message MUST be processed in little-endian byte order, unless otherwise specified.

<a id="Section_2.2.1.1"></a>
#### 2.2.1.1 Shared Message Header (PNP_INFO_HEADER)

All messages in the [PNP Device Info Subprotocol](#Section_1.3.1) have a common header, which is followed by a message-specific payload, as described in the following sections.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-31: "Size"
  32-63: "PacketId"
  64-127: "Message-specific payload (variable)"
```

**Size (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer that indicates the size of the packet, including the payload.

**PacketId (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer representing a unique packet ID that identifies the message. The **PacketId** field MUST be one of the following values.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| IRPDR_ID_VERSION 0x00000065 | Client or Server Version message |
| IRPDR_ID_REDIRECT_DEVICES 0x00000066 | Client Device Addition message |
| IRPDR_ID_SERVER_LOGON 0x00000067 | Authenticated Client message |

# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Common Details

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The organization is provided to explain how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document. An implementation maintains the following data.

**Client device ID:** Both client and server maintain a list of client devices being redirected. The client generates this ID for each device when it sends device information in a [Client Device Addition message](#Section_2.2.1.3.1). For subsequent operations on the devices, both client and server use this ID to refer to the device.

**Client device list:** Both client and server maintain a list of devices being redirected. This list contains the **client device ID** for each redirected device announced in a Client Device Addition message. Devices are added to the list when they are redirected and removed when either the device is removed with a [Client Device Remove message](#Section_2.2.1.3.2), or redirection is canceled.

**Request ID:** For I/O request calls, the server generates a unique, 24-bit ID and sends it with the I/O request to the client. The client and server use this ID to refer to the request in subsequent messages. When a request is sent to the client, the server adds it to the **outstanding requests list**. When the client completes the request, the server removes the entry for the request from the **outstanding requests list**. A request ID MAY be reused after the reply message with that ID is received. In the case of the client receiving a duplicate request ID, the client SHOULD terminate the underlying subprotocol dynamic virtual channel.<11>

**Outstanding requests list:** A list maintained by the server of all valid **Request IDs** sent to the client. The list is invalidated when the underlying dynamic virtual channel for sending the requests or replies is terminated.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

No common timers are used. Individual [**device drivers**](#gt_device-driver) MAY implement time-out logic for I/O requests; however, the operation of these drivers is external to this specification.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The dynamic virtual channel MUST be established by using the parameters described in section [2.1](#Section_2.1) before the protocol operation can commence.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

No higher-layer triggered events are used.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Message-Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

There are no common message-processing events or sequencing rules. See sections [3.2.5](#Section_3.2.5) and [3.3.5](#Section_3.3.5) for client-specific and server-specific message processing.

<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>

#### 3.2.5.1 PNP Device Info Subprotocol

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.1"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.1 Initialization Messages

Initialization messages exchange the basic information necessary to establish the connection and to perform capabilities negotiation.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.1.1"></a>
###### 3.2.5.1.1.1 Processing a Server Version Message

The structure and fields of the [Server Version message](#Section_2.2.1.2.1) are described in section 2.2.1.2.1.

The Server Version message MUST be the first message that the client receives in the protocol sequence.

Similarly, the client MUST acknowledge the message by sending its own version and capabilities information. This way, the server knows what messages the client supports. Future versions of the protocol MAY support new packets that current versions do not support. As a result, this negotiation is important to ensure that no packets are sent from one side that the other cannot interpret.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.1.2"></a>
###### 3.2.5.1.1.2 Sending a Client Version Message

The structure and fields of the [Client Version message](#Section_2.2.1.2.2) are described in section 2.2.1.2.2.

No client-specific events or rules are required.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.1.3"></a>
###### 3.2.5.1.1.3 Processing an Authenticated Client Message

The structure and fields of the [Authenticated Client message](#Section_2.2.1.2.3) are specified in section 2.2.1.2.3.

The server sends the Authenticated Client message after it authenticates the client to the server session. The client MUST NOT send any device addition or removal messages until it receives this message. Only after receiving this message MAY the client send one or more [Client Device Addition messages](#Section_2.2.1.3.1).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.2"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.2 Device Addition and Removal Messages

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.2.1"></a>
###### 3.2.5.1.2.1 Sending a Client Device Addition Message

The structure and fields of the [Client Device Addition message](#Section_2.2.1.3.1) are as specified in section 2.2.1.3.1.

The client MUST generate and assign a unique client device ID for each of the devices in its Client device list that it wants to redirect to the server. This message MUST be sent only after the client receives an [Authenticated Client message](#Section_2.2.1.2.3).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.2.2"></a>
###### 3.2.5.1.2.2 Sending a Client Device Removal Message

The structure and fields of the [Client Device Removal message](#Section_2.2.1.3.2) are as specified in section 2.2.1.3.2.

Before the client sends this message to stop redirecting a particular device, the corresponding device MUST have previously been sent as part of a [Client Device Addition message](#Section_2.2.1.3.1). The client also removes the device from its Client device list.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2"></a>
#### 3.2.5.2 PNP Device I/O Subprotocol

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2.1"></a>
##### 3.2.5.2.1 Initialization Messages

These messages establish the logical connection between server and client, in addition to capabilities. Initialization messages MUST be sent immediately after creating a new dynamic channel connection within the **FileRedirectorChannel** channel. A new channel connection MUST be established for each CreateFile call. These messages are generally followed by the CreateFile message and then by Read, Write, or IOControl messages.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2.1.1"></a>
###### 3.2.5.2.1.1 Processing a Server Capabilities Request Message

The structure and fields of the [Server Capabilities Request message](#Section_2.2.2.2.1) are defined in section 2.2.2.2.1.

This MUST be the first message that a client receives on each connection within the [PNP Device I/O Subprotocol](#Section_1.3.2). The client inspects the version field. For example, if the client receives a version of 6 or later (future versions of the protocol MAY send a later version, although current ones do not) from the packet described in section 2.2.2.2.1, the client MAY send packets that describe custom events, as described in section [2.2.2.3.10](#Section_2.2.2.3.10). However, if the version is earlier than 6, the client MUST NOT send packets that describe custom events.

The client MUST reply with its own version by sending a [Client Capabilities Reply message](#Section_2.2.2.2.2).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2.1.2"></a>
###### 3.2.5.2.1.2 Sending a Client Capabilities Reply

The structure and fields of the [Client Capabilities Reply message](#Section_2.2.2.2.2) are defined in section 2.2.2.2.2.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2.2"></a>
##### 3.2.5.2.2 Device I/O Messages

The device I/O messages in the [PNP Device I/O Subprotocol](#Section_1.3.2) are used to perform real I/O operations on the client devices and to return the result to the server.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2.2.1"></a>
###### 3.2.5.2.2.1 Processing a CreateFile Request Message

The structure and fields of the [CreateFile Request message](#Section_2.2.2.3.1) are defined in section 2.2.2.3.1.

The client MUST use the client device ID passed in the CreateFile Request message to identify the device to use. The client interacts with the local [**device driver**](#gt_device-driver), using the attributes and flags specified in the CreateFile Request message, to service the I/O request.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2.2.2"></a>
###### 3.2.5.2.2.2 Sending a CreateFile Reply Message

The structure and fields of the [CreateFile Reply message](#Section_2.2.2.3.2) are defined in section 2.2.2.3.2.

The result of the client's interaction with the local [**device driver**](#gt_device-driver) in servicing the [CreateFile Request message](#Section_2.2.2.3.1) MUST be returned by the client in the CreateFile Reply message. The client MUST maintain the association of the file [**handle**](#gt_handle) obtained through the dynamic virtual channel connection on which it received the CreateFile Request message, because all I/O requests on the connection are associated with the file handle.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2.2.3"></a>
###### 3.2.5.2.2.3 Processing a Read Request Message

The structure and fields of the [Read Request message](#Section_2.2.2.3.3) are described in section 2.2.2.3.3.

This message MUST be received only after the CreateFile request-response sequence has been sent, establishing a file [**handle**](#gt_handle) for I/O on this connection. On receiving the Read Request message, the client MUST use the associated file handle and the parameters specified in the Read Request message to interact with the local [**device driver**](#gt_device-driver) in servicing this request.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2.2.4"></a>
###### 3.2.5.2.2.4 Sending a Read Reply Message

The structure and fields of the [Read Reply message](#Section_2.2.2.3.4) are described in section 2.2.2.3.4.

###### 3.2.5.2.2.7 Processing an IOControl Request Message

The structure and fields of the [IOControl Request message](#Section_2.2.2.3.7) are described in section 2.2.2.3.7.

This message MUST be received only after the CreateFile request-response sequence has been sent, establishing a file [**handle**](#gt_handle) for I/O on this connection. On receiving the IOControl Request message, the client MUST use the associated file handle and the parameters specified in the IOControl Request message to interact with the local [**device driver**](#gt_device-driver) in servicing this request.

The **DataIn** field MUST contain input data of the size specified in the **cbIn** field, followed by output data in **DataOut** of the size specified in the **cbOut** field.

It is possible that the actual size of the **DataOut** field MAY be smaller than the value provided in the **cbOut** field. The receiver needs to calculate the actual size of the **DataOut** field by subtracting the sum of sizes of all fields except **DataOut** from the total length of the message. If the calculated size of the **DataOut** field is nonzero and does not match the value provided in the **cbOut** field, the request will be completed with an error HRESULT that contains a Win32 error code (ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER) as described in section 2.2 of [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2.2.8"></a>
###### 3.2.5.2.2.8 Sending an IOControl Reply Message

The structure and fields of the [IOControl Reply message](#Section_2.2.2.3.8) are described in section 2.2.2.3.8.

The client MUST use the **RequestId** received in the corresponding [IOControl Request message](#Section_2.2.2.3.7) when constructing this reply. The result of the IOControl operation performed and any output data MUST be returned in the response message.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2.2.9"></a>
###### 3.2.5.2.2.9 Processing a Specific IoCancel Request Message

The structure and fields of the [Specific IoCancel Request message](#Section_2.2.2.3.9) are described in section 2.2.2.3.9.

This message MUST be received only after the CreateFile request-response sequence has been sent, establishing a file [**handle**](#gt_handle) for I/O on this connection. On receiving this message, the client MUST cancel the I/O operation associated with the device that is identified by the value in the **RequestId** field. The appropriate device I/O reply message for that **RequestId** MUST still be sent to the server.

If the IoCancel Request Message has been received by the client and there are no outstanding pending I/O requests, this request MUST be ignored. This applies when the client receives the IoCancel Request after the completion of the I/O request, and after the client receives multiple IoCancel requests.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2.2.10"></a>
###### 3.2.5.2.2.10 Sending a Client Device Custom Event Message

The structure and fields of the [Client Device Custom Event message](#Section_2.2.2.3.10) are described in section 2.2.2.3.10.

When a redirected device generates any custom PNP event, the client MUST notify the server of the event by sending a Client Device Custom Event message to the server. The message MUST contain all the data regarding the custom PNP event, as described in section 2.2.2.3.10. This message MUST be sent only if the protocol version running on both the client and server is 6 or later. The version number is exchanged in packets described in sections [2.2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.2.1) and [2.2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2.2).

###### 3.3.5.1.1.2 Processing a Client Version Message

The structure and fields of the [Client Version message](#Section_2.2.1.2.2) are described in section 2.2.1.2.2.

When the server receives a Client Version message, the server MUST use the version and capabilities received from the client to discover what messages the client understands. Although there is currently only one possible client protocol version, future protocol versions MAY have packets that the current version will not understand.

The server MUST receive this message before any meaningful exchange can take place.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.1.3"></a>
###### 3.3.5.1.1.3 Sending an Authenticated Client Message

The structure and fields of the [Authenticated Client message](#Section_2.2.1.2.3) are described in section 2.2.1.2.3.

The server SHOULD NOT accept any device redirection commands until a user has logged on to the server session. This ensures that nonauthenticated users cannot cause a denial-of-service attack by sending huge volumes of device addition or removal requests. When a user logs on to the server session, the server MUST send the Authenticated Client message, which indicates to the client that the server is ready to process device addition or removal messages.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.2"></a>
##### 3.3.5.1.2 Device Addition and Removal Messages

The following messages are processed only after the client and server have completed initial versioning.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.2.1"></a>
###### 3.3.5.1.2.1 Processing a Client Device Addition Message

The structure and fields of the [Client Device Addition message](#Section_2.2.1.3.1) are described in section 2.2.1.3.1.

For each device contained in the **DeviceDescriptions** field of the Client Device Addition message, the server MUST create a [**remote device**](#gt_remote-device) instance on the server to represent the client-side physical devices and add it to its Client device list. The server MUST also maintain a client device ID for each device. A one-to-one correspondence exists between remote devices and client device IDs. This ID MUST be used to refer to a particular device when making I/O calls.

If the **CustomFlag** field **DeviceDescription** of the device is set to 0x00000001, the server MAY choose not to redirect the device. If the server chooses not to redirect the device, the server silently drops the Client Device Addition message and does not inform the client.

In the case of the server receiving a duplicate **ClientDeviceId** in the PNP_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION subpacket as described in section [2.2.1.3.1.1](#Section_2.2.1.3.1.1), the server SHOULD terminate the underlying subprotocol dynamic virtual channel.<12> The FileRedirectorChannel channel continues to process IO for existing devices and is not terminated. These devices are removed when the session is disconnected.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.2.2"></a>
###### 3.3.5.1.2.2 Processing a Client Device Removal Message

The structure and fields of the [Client Device Removal message](#Section_2.2.1.3.2) are described in section 2.2.1.3.2.

For a device already instantiated on the server and identified by the value in the **ClientDeviceID** field, the server MUST remove all references to the [**remote device**](#gt_remote-device) when this message is received, and also remove it from its Client device list.

###### 3.3.5.2.1.2 Processing a Client Capabilities Reply Message

The structure and fields of the [Client Capabilities Reply message](#Section_2.2.2.2.2) are described in section 2.2.2.2.2. The server MUST receive this message prior to any other message that the client sends. The server MUST NOT complete the initialization of the [**remote device**](#gt_remote-device) until it receives this message.

After receiving the Client Capabilities Reply message, the server MAY begin to process I/O messages. The server MUST NOT process any I/O messages until it receives a version from the client.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.2.2"></a>
##### 3.3.5.2.2 Device I/O Messages

For every request message, the server maintains an entry in the **outstanding requests list**. The entry is invalidated as soon as a corresponding Reply Message is received by the server. If a reply is received by the server and the **Request ID** cannot be found in the **outstanding requests list**, the server MUST ignore the client message.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.2.2.1"></a>
###### 3.3.5.2.2.1 Sending a CreateFile Request Message

The structure and fields of the [CreateFile Request message](#Section_2.2.2.3.1) are described in section 2.2.2.3.1.

The server sends a CreateFile Request message to open or create a file on the client-side device on behalf of an application. The server MUST pass the client device ID to identify the device. The server MUST generate a unique ID for this request and pass it in the **RequestId** field of the [SERVER_IO_HEADER](#Section_2.2.2.1.1) along with any flags or attributes for the create-file request.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.2.2.2"></a>
###### 3.3.5.2.2.2 Processing a CreateFile Reply Message

The structure and fields of the [CreateFile Reply message](#Section_2.2.2.3.2) are described in section 2.2.2.3.2.

No server-specific events or rules are required other than that the server MUST pass the results of the operation contained in the reply to the actual application that made the create-file request.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.2.2.3"></a>
###### 3.3.5.2.2.3 Sending a Read Request Message

The structure and fields of the [Read Request message](#Section_2.2.2.3.3) are described in section 2.2.2.3.3.

This message MUST be sent only after the CreateFile request-response sequence has been sent, establishing a file [**handle**](#gt_handle) for I/O on this connection. The server MUST generate a unique **RequestId** for this request and specify the number of bytes to read. The server also stores all necessary information required to complete the request (for example, a data buffer to store information and the location of a variable to store the result), and associates this information with the **RequestId**.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.2.2.4"></a>
###### 3.3.5.2.2.4 Processing a Read Reply Message

The structure and fields of the [Read Reply message](#Section_2.2.2.3.4) are described in section 2.2.2.3.4.

To process this reply, the server MUST use the **RequestId** specified in the reply message to find the associated information stored after sending the request message. With this information, the server completes the original request. The server MUST redirect the result of the Read operation contained in the reply to the actual application that made the read request.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.2.2.5"></a>
###### 3.3.5.2.2.5 Sending a Write Request Message

###### 3.3.5.2.2.6 Processing a Write Reply Message

The structure and fields of the [Write Reply message](#Section_2.2.2.3.6) are described in section 2.2.2.3.6.

To process this reply, the server MUST use the **RequestId** specified in the reply message to find the associated information stored after sending the request message. With this information, the server completes the original request. The server MUST redirect the result of the Write operation contained in the reply to the actual application that made the write request.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.2.2.7"></a>
###### 3.3.5.2.2.7 Sending an IOControl Request Message

The structure and fields of the [IOControl Request message](#Section_2.2.2.3.7) are described in section 2.2.2.3.7.

This message MUST be sent only after the CreateFile request-response sequence has been sent, establishing a file [**handle**](#gt_handle) for I/O on this connection. The server MUST generate a **RequestId** for this request and the server MUST pass along the rest of the IOControl parameters. The server also stores all necessary information required to complete the request (for example, the location of a variable to store the result), and associates this information with the **RequestId**.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.2.2.8"></a>
###### 3.3.5.2.2.8 Processing an IOControl Reply Message

The structure and fields of the [IOControl Reply message](#Section_2.2.2.3.8) are described in section 2.2.2.3.8.

To process this reply, the server MUST use the **RequestId** specified in the reply message to find the associated information stored after sending the request message. With this information, the server completes the original request. The server MUST redirect the result of the I/O operation contained in the reply to the actual application that made the I/O request.

If the cbBytesReadReturned field has value bigger than cbOut field of the corresponding IOControl Request Message, the underlying dynamic virtual channel transport for this subprotocol MUST be terminated.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.2.2.9"></a>
###### 3.3.5.2.2.9 Sending a Specific IoCancel Request Message

The structure and fields of the [Specific IoCancel Request message](#Section_2.2.2.3.9) are described in section 2.2.2.3.9.

No server-specific events or rules are required. This request does not invalidate the RequestId of the I/O request message that is to be canceled. The pending application request MUST be completed only when the I/O reply message is received, either because of cancellation or normal completion of the original I/O request.

The server MUST NOT send more than one IoCancel Request Message per I/O request.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.2.2.10"></a>
###### 3.3.5.2.2.10 Processing a Client Device Custom Event Message

The structure and fields of the [Client Device Custom Event message](#Section_2.2.2.3.10) are described in section 2.2.2.3.10.

On receiving a Client Device Custom Event message, the server MUST notify all applications registered for the event on the server system by using the parameters contained in the message. If there is no such application the message MUST be ignored. This message MUST be processed only if the protocol version running on both the client side and the server side is 6 or later. Otherwise it MUST be ignored.

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

There are no security considerations for the Remote Desktop Protocol: Plug and Play Devices Virtual Channel Extension because all traffic is secured by the underlying Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) core protocol. For more information about implemented security-related mechanisms, see [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md) section 5.

<a id="Section_5.2"></a>

- Windows Server 2016 operating system
- Windows Server operating system
- Windows Server 2019 operating system
- Windows Server 2022 operating system
- Windows 11 operating system
- Windows Server 2025 operating system
Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1: The server-side implementation of this protocol is applicable to Windows Vista Enterprise operating system, Windows Vista operating system Ultimate, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 Enterprise operating system, Windows 7 Ultimate operating system, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8 Enterprise operating system, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1 Enterprise, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server operating system, and Windows Server 2019.

<2> Section 2.2.1.2.1: In the Windows implementation of this protocol, this value is 0x00000001.

<3> Section 2.2.1.2.1: In the Windows implementation of this protocol, this value is 0x00000005.

<4> Section 2.2.1.2.2: In the Windows implementation of this protocol, this value is 0x00000001.

<5> Section 2.2.1.2.2: In the Windows implementation of this protocol, this value is 0x00000005.

<6> Section 2.2.1.3.1.1: This field is not used in Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008.

<7> Section 2.2.1.3.1.1: This field is not used in Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008.

<8> Section 2.2.1.3.1.1: This field is not used in Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008.

<9> Section 2.2.2.3.1: In the Windows implementation of this protocol, this value is set to 0xC0000000, meaning generic read and generic write.

<10> Section 2.2.2.3.1: The Windows implementation of this protocol sets this field to 0x00000003 (OPEN_EXISTING).

<11> Section 3.1.1: When handling duplicate request IDs on the client side, the Windows implementation does not terminate the subprotocol virtual channel. Instead, it ignores the condition, which can lead to the wrong I/O request being completed and returned.

<12> Section 3.3.5.1.2.1: When handling a duplicate **ClientDeviceId** on the server side, the Windows implementation does not terminate the subprotocol virtual channel. Instead, it ignores the condition, which can lead to the case where the I/O is received by the wrong device on the client side.
