# 1 Introduction

This is a specification of the Shell Link Binary File Format. In this format a structure is called a [**shell link**](#gt_shell-link), or [**shortcut**](#gt_shortcut), and is a data [**object**](#gt_object) that contains information that can be used to access another data object. The Shell Link Binary File Format is the format of Windows files with the extension "LNK".

Shell links are commonly used to support application launching and linking scenarios, such as [**Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)**](#gt_object-linking-and-embedding-ole), but they also can be used by applications that need the ability to store a reference to a target file.

Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_american-national-standards-institute-ansi-character-set"></a>
**American National Standards Institute (ANSI) character set**: A character set defined by a [**code page**](#gt_code-page) approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The term "ANSI" as used to signify Windows code pages is a historical reference and a misnomer that persists in the Windows community. The source of this misnomer stems from the fact that the Windows code page 1252 was originally based on an ANSI draft, which became International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 8859-1 [[ISO/IEC-8859-1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90689). In Windows, the ANSI character set can be any of the following code pages: 1252, 1250, 1251, 1253, 1254, 1255, 1256, 1257, 1258, 874, 932, 936, 949, or 950. For example, "ANSI application" is usually a reference to a non-[**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) or code-page-based application. Therefore, "ANSI character set" is often misused to refer to one of the character sets defined by a Windows code page that can be used as an active system code page; for example, character sets defined by code page 1252 or character sets defined by code page 950. Windows is now based on Unicode, so the use of ANSI character sets is strongly discouraged unless they are used to interoperate with legacy applications or legacy data.

<a id="gt_augmented-backus-naur-form-abnf"></a>
**Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)**: A modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), commonly used by Internet specifications. ABNF notation balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power. ABNF differs from standard BNF in its definitions and uses of naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges. For more information, see [[RFC5234]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096).

<a id="gt_class-identifier-clsid"></a>
**class identifier (CLSID)**: A [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) that identifies a software component; for instance, a DCOM object class or a COM class.

<a id="gt_code-page"></a>
**code page**: An ordered set of characters of a specific script in which a numerical index (code-point value) is associated with each character. Code pages are a means of providing support for character sets and keyboard layouts used in different countries/regions. Devices such as the display and keyboard can be configured to use a specific code page and to switch from one code page (such as the United States) to another (such as Portugal) at the user's request.

<a id="gt_extra-data-section"></a>
**extra data section**: A data structure appended to the basic Shell Link Binary File Format data that contains additional information about the [**link target**](#gt_link-target).

<a id="gt_folder-guid-id"></a>
**folder GUID ID**: A [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) value that identifies a known folder. Some folder GUID ID values correspond to [**folder integer ID**](#gt_folder-integer-id) values.

<a id="gt_folder-integer-id"></a>
**folder integer ID**: An integer value that identifies a known folder.

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) have to be used for generating the GUID. See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_item-id-itemid"></a>
**item ID (ItemID)**: A structure that represents an item in the context of a [**shell data source**](#gt_shell-data-source).

<a id="gt_item-id-list-idlist"></a>
**item ID list (IDList)**: A data structure that refers to a location. An item ID list is a multi-segment data structure where each segment's content is defined by a data source that is responsible for the location in the [**namespace**](#gt_namespace) referred to by the preceding segments.

<a id="gt_link"></a>
**link**: An [**object**](#gt_object) that refers to another item.

<a id="gt_link-target"></a>
**link target**: The item that a [**link**](#gt_link) references. In the case of a [**shell link**](#gt_shell-link), the referenced item is identified by its location in the [**link target namespace**](#gt_link-target-namespace) using an [**item ID list (IDList)**](#gt_item-id-list-idlist).

<a id="gt_link-target-namespace"></a>
**link target namespace**: A hierarchical [**namespace**](#gt_namespace). In Windows, the link target namespace is the Windows Explorer [**namespace**](#gt_namespace), as described in [[MSDN-ShellNamespace]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=313431).

<a id="gt_little-endian"></a>
**little-endian**: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the least significant byte stored in the memory location with the lowest address.

<a id="gt_namespace"></a>
**namespace**: An abstract container that provides context for the items (names, technical terms, or words) that it holds and allows disambiguation of items that have the same name (residing in different [**namespaces**](#gt_namespace)).

<a id="gt_netbios-name"></a>
**NetBIOS name**: A 16-byte address that is used to identify a NetBIOS resource on the network. For more information, see [[RFC1001]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90260) and [[RFC1002]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90261).

<a id="gt_object"></a>
**object**: In COM, a software entity that implements the IUnknown interface and zero or more additional interfaces that can be obtained from each other using the IUnknown interface. A COM [**object**](#gt_object) can be exposed to remote clients via the DCOM protocol, in which case it is also a DCOM object.

<a id="gt_object-linking-and-embedding-ole"></a>
**Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)**: A technology for transferring and sharing information between applications by inserting a file or part of a file into a compound document. The inserted file can be either embedded or linked. See also embedded object and linked object.

<a id="gt_red-green-blue-rgb"></a>
**red-green-blue (RGB)**: A color model that describes color information in terms of the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) intensities in a color.

<a id="gt_relative-path"></a>
**relative path**: A path that is implied by the active working directory or is calculated based on a specified directory. If users enter a command that refers to a file and the full path is not entered, the active working directory is the relative path of the referenced file.

<a id="gt_reparse-point"></a>
**reparse point**: An attribute that can be added to a file to store a collection of user-defined data that is opaque to NTFS or ReFS. If a file that has a reparse point is opened, the open will normally fail with STATUS_REPARSE, so that the relevant file system filter driver can detect the open of a file associated with (owned by) this reparse point. At that point, each installed filter driver can check to see if it is the owner of the reparse point, and, if so, perform any special processing required for a file with that reparse point. The format of this data is understood by the application that stores the data and the file system filter that interprets the data and processes the file. For example, an encryption filter that is marked as the owner of a file's reparse point could look up the encryption key for that file. A file can have (at most) 1 reparse point associated with it. For more information, see [MS-FSCC](../MS-FSCC/MS-FSCC.md).

<a id="gt_resolve-a-link"></a>
**resolve a link**: The act of finding a specific [**link target**](#gt_link-target), confirming that it exists, and finding whether it has moved.

<a id="gt_shell-data-source"></a>
**shell data source**: An [**object**](#gt_object) that is responsible for a specific location in the [**namespace**](#gt_namespace) and for enumerating and binding [**IDLists**](#gt_item-id-list-idlist) to handlers.

<a id="gt_shell-link"></a>
**shell link**: A structure in Shell Link Binary File Format.

<a id="gt_shim"></a>
**shim**: A mechanism used to provide custom behavior to applications that do not work on newer versions of the operating system.

<a id="gt_shortcut"></a>
**shortcut**: A term that is used synonymously with [**shell link**](#gt_shell-link).

<a id="gt_sparse-file"></a>
**sparse file**: A file containing large sections of data composed only of zeros. This file is marked as a sparse file in the file system, which saves disk space by only allocating as many ranges on disk as are required to completely reconstruct the non-zero data. When an attempt is made to read in the nonallocated portions of the file (also known as holes), the file system automatically returns zeros to the caller.

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world. The [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) standard [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16 BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

<a id="gt_universal-naming-convention-unc"></a>
**Universal Naming Convention (UNC)**: A string format that specifies the location of a resource. For more information, see [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.2.57.

<a id="gt_utc-coordinated-universal-time"></a>
**UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)**: A high-precision atomic time standard that approximately tracks Universal Time (UT). It is the basis for legal, civil time all over the Earth. Time zones around the world are expressed as positive and negative offsets from UTC. In this role, it is also referred to as Zulu time (Z) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). In these specifications, all references to UTC refer to the time at UTC–0 (or GMT).

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

The Shell Link Binary File Format specifies a structure called a [**shell link**](#gt_shell-link). That structure is used to store a reference to a location in a [**link target namespace**](#gt_link-target-namespace), which is referred to as a [**link target**](#gt_link-target). The most important component of a link target namespace is a link target in the form of an [**item ID list (IDList)**](#gt_item-id-list-idlist).

The shell link structure stores various information that is useful to end users, including:

- A keyboard shortcut that can be used to launch an application.
- A descriptive comment.
- Settings that control application behavior.
- Optional data stored in [**extra data sections**](#gt_extra-data-section).
Optional data can include a property store that contains an extensible set of properties in the format that is described in [MS-PROPSTORE](../MS-PROPSTORE/MS-PROPSTORE.md).

The Shell Link Binary File Format can be managed using a COM [**object**](#gt_object), programmed using the **IShellLink** interface, and saved into its persistence format using the **IPersistStream** or **IPersistFile** interface. It is most common for shell links to be stored in a file with the .LNK file extension. By using the **IPersistStream** interface, a shell link can be saved into another storage system, for example a database or the registry, or embedded in another file format. For more information, see [[MSDN-ISHELLLINK]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=145763).

Multi-byte data values in the Shell Link Binary File Format are stored in [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) format.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Protocols and Other Structures

The Shell Link Binary File Format is used by the Compound File Binary File Format [MS-CFB](../MS-CFB/MS-CFB.md).

The Shell Link Binary File Format uses the Property Store Binary File Format [MS-PROPSTORE](../MS-PROPSTORE/MS-PROPSTORE.md).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Applicability Statement

This document specifies a persistence format for links to files in a file system or to applications that are available for installation. This persistence format is applicable for use as a stand-alone file and for containment within other structures.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Versioning and Localization

This specification covers versioning issues in the following areas:

**Localization**: The Shell Link Binary File Format defines the [ConsoleFEDataBlock](#Section_2.5.2) structure (section 2.5.2), which specifies a [**code page**](#gt_code-page) for displaying text. That value can be used to specify a set of characters for a particular language or locale.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Vendor-Extensible Fields

A [**shell data source**](#gt_shell-data-source) can extend the persistence format by storing custom data inside [**ItemID**](#gt_item-id-itemid) structure.

The ItemIDs embedded in an [**IDList**](#gt_item-id-list-idlist) are in a format specified by the shell data sources that manage the ItemIDs. The ItemIDs are free to store whatever data is needed in this structure to uniquely identify the items in their [**namespace**](#gt_namespace).

The property store embedded in a [**link**](#gt_link) can be used to store property values in the [**shell link**](#gt_shell-link).

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Structures

The Shell Link Binary File Format consists of a sequence of structures that conform to the following [**ABNF**](#gt_augmented-backus-naur-form-abnf) rules [[RFC5234]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096).

SHELL_LINK = SHELL_LINK_HEADER [LINKTARGET_IDLIST] [LINKINFO]

[STRING_DATA] *EXTRA_DATA

**SHELL_LINK_HEADER**: A [ShellLinkHeader](#Section_2.1) structure (section 2.1), which contains identification information, timestamps, and flags that specify the presence of optional structures.

**LINKTARGET_IDLIST**: An optional [LinkTargetIDList](#Section_2.2) structure (section 2.2), which specifies the target of the [**link**](#gt_link). The presence of this structure is specified by the **HasLinkTargetIDList** bit ([LinkFlags](#Section_2.1.1) section 2.1.1) in the ShellLinkHeader.

**LINKINFO**: An optional [LinkInfo](#Section_2.3) structure (section 2.3), which specifies information necessary to resolve the [**link target**](#gt_link-target). The presence of this structure is specified by the **HasLinkInfo** bit (LinkFlags section 2.1.1) in the ShellLinkHeader.

**STRING_DATA**: Zero or more optional [StringData](#Section_2.4) structures (section 2.4), which are used to convey user interface and path identification information. The presence of these structures is specified by bits (LinkFlags section 2.1.1) in the ShellLinkHeader.

**EXTRA_DATA**: Zero or more [ExtraData](#Section_2.5) structures (section 2.5).

**Notes:**

- Structures of the Shell Link Binary File Format can define strings in fixed-length fields. In fixed-length fields, strings MUST be null-terminated. If a string is smaller than the size of the field that contains it, the bytes in the field following the terminating null character are undefined and can have any value. The undefined bytes MUST NOT be used.
- Some Shell Link Binary File Format structures contain size fields; for example, **HeaderSize** in the ShellLinkHeader structure (section 2.1) and **LinkInfoSize** in the LinkInfo structure (section 2.3). Unless otherwise specified, the value contained by these size fields includes the size of size field itself.
<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 ShellLinkHeader

The ShellLinkHeader structure contains identification information, timestamps, and flags that specify the presence of optional structures, including [LinkTargetIDList (section 2.2)](#Section_2.2), [LinkInfo (section 2.3)](#Section_2.3), and [StringData (section 2.4)](#Section_2.4).

**HeaderSize (4 bytes):** The size, in bytes, of this structure. This value MUST be 0x0000004C.

**LinkCLSID (16 bytes):** A [**class identifier (CLSID)**](#gt_class-identifier-clsid). This value MUST be 00021401-0000-0000-C000-000000000046.

**LinkFlags (4 bytes):** A [LinkFlags](#Section_2.1.1) structure (section 2.1.1) that specifies information about the [**shell link**](#gt_shell-link) and the presence of optional portions of the structure.

**FileAttributes (4 bytes):** A [FileAttributesFlags](#Section_2.1.2) structure (section 2.1.2) that specifies information about the [**link target**](#gt_link-target).

**CreationTime (8 bytes):** A FILETIME structure ([MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.3.3) that specifies the creation time of the link target in [**UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)**](#gt_utc-coordinated-universal-time). If the value is zero, there is no creation time set on the link target.

**AccessTime (8 bytes):** A FILETIME structure ([MS-DTYP] section 2.3.3) that specifies the access time of the link target in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). If the value is zero, there is no access time set on the link target.

**WriteTime (8 bytes):** A FILETIME structure ([MS-DTYP] section 2.3.3) that specifies the write time of the link target in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). If the value is zero, there is no write time set on the link target.

**FileSize (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the size, in bytes, of the link target. If the link target file is larger than 0xFFFFFFFF, this value specifies the least significant 32 bits of the link target file size.

**IconIndex (4 bytes):** A 32-bit signed integer that specifies the index of an icon within a given icon location.

**ShowCommand (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the expected window state of an application launched by the link. This value SHOULD be one of the following.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| SW_SHOWNORMAL 0x00000001 | The application is open and its window is open in a normal fashion. |
| SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED 0x00000003 | The application is open, and keyboard focus is given to the application, but its window is not shown. |
| SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE 0x00000007 | The application is open, but its window is not shown. It is not given the keyboard focus. |

All other values MUST be treated as **SW_SHOWNORMAL**.

**HotKey (2 bytes):** A [HotKeyFlags](#Section_2.1.3) structure (section 2.1.3) that specifies the keystrokes used to launch the application referenced by the shortcut key. This value is assigned to the application after it is launched, so that pressing the key activates that application.

**Reserved1 (2 bytes):** A value that MUST be zero.

**Reserved2 (4 bytes):** A value that MUST be zero.

**Reserved3 (4 bytes):** A value that MUST be zero.

<a id="Section_2.1.1"></a>
### 2.1.1 LinkFlags

The LinkFlags structure defines bits that specify which [**shell link**](#gt_shell-link) structures are present in the file format after the [ShellLinkHeader](#Section_2.1) structure (section 2.1).
