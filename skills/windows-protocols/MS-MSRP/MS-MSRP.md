# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Messenger Service Remote Protocol. The Messenger Service Remote Protocol is a set of [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interfaces that instruct a [**server**](#gt_server) (referred to in this document as a "[**message server**](#gt_message-server)") to perform one or more of the following tasks:

- Deliver messages to a local or remote message server for display to a console user.
- Manage the names for which the message server receives messages.
The message server does not maintain [**client**](#gt_client) state information.

It is recommended that this protocol not be implemented due to the lack of security features in the protocol, as described in section [5.1](#Section_5).

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_access-control-list-acl"></a>
**access control list (ACL)**: A list of access control entries (ACEs) that collectively describe the security rules for authorizing access to some resource; for example, an object or set of objects.

<a id="gt_client"></a>
**client**: A computer on which the remote procedure call (RPC) client is executing.

<a id="gt_endpoint"></a>
**endpoint**: A network-specific address of a [**remote procedure call (RPC) server**](#gt_rpc-server) process for remote procedure calls. The actual name and type of the endpoint depends on the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol sequence that is being used. For example, for RPC over TCP (RPC Protocol Sequence ncacn_ip_tcp), an endpoint might be TCP port 1025. For RPC over Server Message Block (RPC Protocol Sequence ncacn_np), an endpoint might be the name of a named pipe. For more information, see [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824).

<a id="gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn"></a>
**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**: An unambiguous domain name that gives an absolute location in the Domain Name System's (DNS) hierarchy tree, as defined in [[RFC1035]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90264) section 3.1 and [[RFC2181]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=127732) section 11.

<a id="gt_local-area-network-adapter-lana"></a>
**local area network adapter (LANA)**: In NetBios-specific implementations, a number that is used to identify the network adapter to which NetBIOS is bound.

<a id="gt_mailslot"></a>
**mailslot**: A mechanism for one-way interprocess communications (IPC). For more information, see [[MSLOT]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90218) and [MS-MAIL](../MS-MAIL/MS-MAIL.md).

<a id="gt_message-server"></a>
**message server**: A [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) server that implements this protocol.

<a id="gt_netbios-name"></a>
**NetBIOS name**: A 16-byte address that is used to identify a NetBIOS resource on the network. For more information, see [[RFC1001]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90260) and [[RFC1002]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90261).

<a id="gt_netbios-suffix"></a>
**NetBIOS suffix**: The 16th byte of a 16-byte [**NetBIOS name**](#gt_netbios-name) that is constructed using the optional naming convention defined in [MS-NBTE](../MS-NBTE/MS-NBTE.md) section 1.8.

<a id="gt_original-equipment-manufacturer-oem-character-set"></a>
**original equipment manufacturer (OEM) character set**: A character encoding used where the mappings between characters is dependent upon the code page configured on the machine, typically by the manufacturer.

<a id="gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc"></a>
**remote procedure call (RPC)**: A context-dependent term commonly overloaded with three meanings. Note that much of the industry literature concerning RPC technologies uses this term interchangeably for any of the three meanings. Following are the three definitions: (*) The runtime environment providing remote procedure call facilities. The preferred usage for this meaning is "RPC runtime". (*) The pattern of request and response message exchange between two parties (typically, a client and a server). The preferred usage for this meaning is "RPC exchange". (*) A single message from an exchange as defined in the previous definition. The preferred usage for this term is "RPC message". For more information about RPC, see [C706].

<a id="gt_rpc-dynamic-endpoint"></a>
**RPC dynamic endpoint**: A network-specific server address that is requested and assigned at run time, as described in [C706].

<a id="gt_rpc-endpoint"></a>
**RPC endpoint**: A network-specific address of a server process for remote procedure calls (RPCs). The actual name of the RPC endpoint depends on the RPC protocol sequence being used. For example, for the NCACN_IP_TCP RPC protocol sequence an RPC endpoint might be TCP port 1025. For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_rpc-protocol-sequence"></a>
**RPC protocol sequence**: A character string that represents a valid combination of a [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol, a network layer protocol, and a transport layer protocol, as described in [C706] and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

<a id="gt_rpc-server"></a>
**RPC server**: A computer on the network that waits for messages, processes them when they arrive, and sends responses using RPC as its transport acts as the responder during a remote procedure call (RPC) exchange.

<a id="gt_rpc-transport"></a>
**RPC transport**: The underlying network services used by the remote procedure call (RPC) runtime for communications between network nodes. For more information, see [C706] section 2.

<a id="gt_server"></a>
**server**: A computer on which the [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) server is executing.

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world. The [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) standard [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16 BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [C706] must be used for generating the UUID.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The Messenger Service Remote Protocol suite is designed to perform the following functions:

- Receive and display short text messages to the console user. (This function is referred to in this document as the "messaging protocol".)
- Manage the names for which a [**message server**](#gt_message-server) receives messages. (This function is referred to in this document as the "name management protocol".)
The name management protocol portion of the Messenger Service Remote Protocol is used to manage the set of names for which the message server accepts messages. The operations in this protocol are very simple, consisting of add, remove, and enumeration methods. The messaging protocol portion of the Messenger Service Remote Protocol actually has several forms and runs over [**mailslots**](#gt_mailslot) over Server Message Block Protocol, as specified in [MS-SMB](../MS-SMB/MS-SMB.md) and [**RPC dynamic endpoints**](#gt_rpc-dynamic-endpoint) over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) (as specified in [[RFC768]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90490)). For how the message [**client**](#gt_client) selects the transport that is used for the messaging protocol, see section [3.2](#Section_1.3).

Typically, the Messenger Service Remote Protocol is used to send a short text message from a [**server**](#gt_server), such as a file server or print server, to a client machine; for example, to indicate that a print job has completed or that a file server is shutting down and all of its clients need to save their work and disconnect. As such, the roles of client and server are reversed from typical protocols, with the message server (recipient) of the messages often being the workstation machine and the message client (sender) being a server-class machine.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Messenger Service Remote Protocol suite is dependent on [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) (as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824)), the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol (as specified in [MS-SMB](../MS-SMB/MS-SMB.md)), and the [**mailslot**](#gt_mailslot) datagram delivery service (as specified in [MS-MAIL](../MS-MAIL/MS-MAIL.md)), which are its transports.

The Messenger Service Remote Protocol uses [**NetBIOS names**](#gt_netbios-name) (as specified in [[RFC1001]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90260) section 14 and [[RFC1002]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90261) section 4.1) to identify message recipients.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The messenger service name management protocol is an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interface and, as a result, has the prerequisites specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) as being common to RPC interfaces. Both the message [**client**](#gt_client) and the [**message server**](#gt_message-server) have to have working RPC implementations.

The messenger service messaging protocol also uses the [**mailslot**](#gt_mailslot) (as specified in [MS-MAIL](../MS-MAIL/MS-MAIL.md)) datagram delivery mechanism and the CIFS Protocol (as specified in [MS-CIFS](../MS-CIFS/MS-CIFS.md)) for delivering messages to remote machines, and, therefore, it depends on this mailslot delivery mechanism being operational before the messenger service begins operation. For mailslot operational requirements, see [MS-MAIL] section1.5. For the mailslot delivery mechanism, see [MS-CIFS] section2.2.5.12.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The messenger service name management protocol is suitable only for managing simple [**NetBIOS names**](#gt_netbios-name). The messenger service messaging protocol is suitable only for short, human-readable messages that require no security and have no delivery guarantees.<1>

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

- Supported transports: The Messenger Service Remote Protocol uses [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over UDP (as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md)), RPC over Named Pipes (for more information, see [[PIPE]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90247)), SMB (as specified in [MS-SMB](../MS-SMB/MS-SMB.md)), and [**mailslots**](#gt_mailslot) (as specified in [MS-MAIL](../MS-MAIL/MS-MAIL.md)) for its transports.
- Protocol version: This protocol's RPC interfaces have a version number of 1.0.
- Security and authentication methods: See section [2.1](#Section_2.1).
- Capability negotiation: None.
<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

The Messenger Service Remote Protocol does not include any vendor-extensible fields.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

There are no standards assignments directly associated with this protocol.

This protocol does depend on [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) and uses the following RPC [**UUIDs**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid):

- 17FDD703-1827-4E34-79D4-24A55C53BB37 (for name management methods)
- 5A7B91F8-FF00-11D0-A9B2-00C04FB6E6FC (for the [NetrSendMessage](#Section_3.2.4.1) method)
This protocol does use NetBIOS for message delivery in some cases. If NetBIOS is used on a TCP/IP network, UDP port 138 can be used, and NetBIOS might need to perform other functions such as name resolution on other ports (as specified in [[RFC1001]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90260) and [[RFC1002]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90261)) to support this protocol.

When this protocol uses named pipes, the pipe name used is \PIPE\MSGSVC.

When this protocol uses [**mailslots**](#gt_mailslot) for message delivery, the mailslot name used is \\recipient name\MAILSLOT\MESSNGR where recipient name is the [**NetBIOS name**](#gt_netbios-name) of the intended recipient of the message.

This protocol builds NetBIOS names using the convention defined in [MS-NBTE](../MS-NBTE/MS-NBTE.md) section 1.8, with a [**NetBIOS suffix**](#gt_netbios-suffix) value of 0x03.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

This protocol suite has a variety of transports, the use of which is detailed in the following sections. Implementations MAY use any one of the transports.

<a id="Section_2.1.1"></a>
### 2.1.1 RPC Transport

The Messenger Service Remote Protocol MUST use either the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over UDP protocol sequence (NCADG_IP_UDP) or the RPC over Named Pipes (NCACN_NP) protocol sequence, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md), depending on the interface used. When RPC over Named Pipes is used as the [**RPC protocol sequence**](#gt_rpc-protocol-sequence), the pipe name that MUST be used is \PIPE\MSGSVC. For the NCADG_IP_UDP, see section [3.2.4](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md). For the NCACN_NP protocol, see section [3.1.4](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

This protocol MUST use the following [**UUIDs**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid):

- 17FDD703-1827-4E34-79D4-24A55C53BB37 (for recipient name management methods)
- 5A7B91F8-FF00-11D0-A9B2-00C04FB6E6FC (for the [NetrSendMessage](#Section_3.2.4.1) method)
This protocol MUST use [**RPC dynamic endpoints**](#gt_rpc-dynamic-endpoint) for RPC over TCP/IP, as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) section 4.

For each recipient name registered with the [**message server**](#gt_message-server), on each bound [**local area network adapter (LANA)**](#gt_local-area-network-adapter-lana), the message server MUST register the corresponding [**NetBIOS name**](#gt_netbios-name) using the convention defined in [MS-NBTE](../MS-NBTE/MS-NBTE.md) section 1.8, with a [**NetBIOS suffix**](#gt_netbios-suffix) value of 0x03.

This protocol allows any user to establish a connection to the [**RPC server**](#gt_rpc-server). When using named pipes as the [**RPC transport**](#gt_rpc-transport), the protocol uses the underlying RPC protocol to retrieve the identity of the caller that made the method call, as specified in [MS-RPCE]. The message server SHOULD use this identity to perform method-specific access checks, as specified in section [3.1.4.5](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md). When using UDP as the RPC transport, the protocol does not perform authentication.

<a id="Section_2.1.2"></a>
### 2.1.2 Mailslots

This protocol MUST use the [**mailslot**](#gt_mailslot) datagram delivery [**server**](#gt_server), as specified in [MS-MAIL](../MS-MAIL/MS-MAIL.md). Mailslot messages, specified in sections [3.2.4.4](#Section_2) and [3.2.4.5](#Section_2), MUST be sent to the following mailslot: \\recipient name\MAILSLOT\MESSNGR.

The recipient name MUST be the [**NetBIOS name**](#gt_netbios-name) of the intended recipient of the message.

The [**message server**](#gt_message-server) MUST create this mailslot for each recipient name that is registered with the message server before it can receive messages for that recipient.

When using mailslots to transport messages, the protocol does not perform authentication.

<a id="Section_2.1.3"></a>
### 2.1.3 SMB

The Messenger Service Remote Protocol MUST use the SMB [**server**](#gt_server), as specified in [MS-SMB](../MS-SMB/MS-SMB.md). SMB messages are specified in sections [3.2.4.4](#Section_2) and [3.2.4.5](#Section_2).

# 3 Protocol Details

As noted in section [1.3](#Section_1.3), there are two protocols that form the Messenger Service Remote Protocol suite. The first, the name management protocol, allows the invoker to control the names to which the [**message server**](#gt_message-server) responds. The second, the messaging protocol, contains the methods by which a message [**client**](#gt_client) can send a text message to the message server.

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Name Management Protocol

The purpose of the name management protocol of the Messenger Service Remote Protocol suite is to manage the name table.

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The organization is provided to explain how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

The [**message server**](#gt_message-server) maintains a table (in memory) of [**NetBIOS names**](#gt_netbios-name) for which messages can be received. The message server maintains one such table per [**LANA**](#gt_local-area-network-adapter-lana). The names typically include the name of the machine and the names of the users who are currently using the machine. Each name MUST be a valid NetBIOS name with a [**NetBIOS suffix**](#gt_netbios-suffix) value of 0x03. The message server MUST only listen for NetBIOS names with suffix value 0x03, which specifies a message alias type.<9>

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

Timers are used to retry some name management operations that might initially fail due to contention issues with a name table. This behavior is specified in section [3.1.4.6](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md). Timers are used by [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) to implement resiliency to network outages, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md). Timers are present in [**NetBIOS name**](#gt_netbios-name) operations, as specified in [[RFC1001]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90260) section 15 and [[RFC1002]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90261) section 4.2.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The [**message server**](#gt_message-server) side MUST register the [**endpoint**](#gt_endpoint) (as specified in section [2.1.1](#Section_2.1.1)) with [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) (as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md)) using default security settings and dynamic endpoints. The server SHOULD register the local machine name as if it had received [NetrMessageNameAdd](#Section_3.1.4.1), as specified in section [3.1.4.6](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Message Processing and Sequencing Rules

Methods in RPC Opnum Order

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [NetrMessageNameAdd](#Section_3.1.4.1) | Opnum: 0 |

#### 3.1.4.5 Sending NetrMessageNameAdd

The message [**client**](#gt_client) MUST select a [**message server**](#gt_message-server) for the Messenger Service Remote Protocol by means outside the protocol, and MUST set *ServerName* to the [**NetBIOS name**](#gt_netbios-name) or the [**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**](#gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn) of the message server.

The message client MUST select a recipient name by means outside the protocol, and it MUST set *MsgName* to the NetBIOS name of the recipient to add.<11>

<a id="Section_3.1.4.6"></a>
#### 3.1.4.6 Receiving NetrMessageNameAdd

On receipt of this message, the [**message server**](#gt_message-server) SHOULD check an internal [**access control list (ACL)**](#gt_access-control-list-acl) to determine whether the message [**client**](#gt_client) is authorized to access the name list. If the ACL authorization check is performed, and the message client is not authorized to perform the operation, the message server MUST return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.<12>

Next, the message server MUST convert *MsgName* to a valid [**NetBIOS name**](#gt_netbios-name), as specified in [[RFC1001]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90260) section 5.2 and [[RFC1002]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90261) section 4.1. If *MsgName* is not valid, the message server MUST return ERROR_INVALID_NAME. The process for conversion is as follows:

- [**Server**](#gt_server) MUST convert *MsgName* to an ASCII string.
- Server MUST truncate *MsgName* to 15 characters if *MsgName* is longer than 15 characters.
- Server MUST pad *MsgName* to 15 characters with the ASCII space character if *MsgName* is shorter than 15 characters.
- Server MUST remove the null terminator for *MsgName*, if present.
- Server MUST append the [**NetBIOS suffix**](#gt_netbios-suffix) value 0x03 to the converted *MsgName*.
If *MsgName* is valid, the message server MUST check each [**LANA**](#gt_local-area-network-adapter-lana) to see if *MsgName* is currently in the name table on that LANA.

- If *MsgName* is in the name table on any LANA, the message server MUST return NERR_AlreadyExists.
- If *MsgName* is currently in a delete pending status on any LANA, the message server MUST wait 5 seconds and check again. At that time, if *MsgName* is still present in the name table on that LANA, the message server MUST return NERR_AlreadyExists.
- If *MsgName* is not in the name table on any LANA, the message server MUST add *MsgName* to the name table on every LANA.
If the message server is unable to add *MsgName* to the name table on any LANA because the name table is full on that LANA, the message server MUST return NERR_TooManyNames.<13>

If the message server fails to add *MsgName* to the name table on any LANA, the message server MUST attempt to delete *MsgName* from the name table on any LANAs where it had successfully added *MsgName*. If it fails to delete *MsgName* from any name tables on any LANA, the message server MUST return NERR_InternalError.

If the message server successfully added *MsgName* to all LANAs, the message server MUST return ERROR_SUCCESS.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.7"></a>
#### 3.1.4.7 Sending NetrMessageNameEnum

The message [**client**](#gt_client) MUST select a [**message server**](#gt_message-server) for this protocol by means outside the protocol, and MUST set *ServerName* to the [**NetBIOS name**](#gt_netbios-name) or the [**fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**](#gt_fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn) of the message server.

The message client MUST select the information **Level** that is wanted, either 0 or 1, by means outside the protocol, and MUST set **Level** accordingly.

Fulfilling a [NetrMessageNameEnum](#Section_3.1.4.8) request might require multiple calls to this interface. If this is the first call to the interface for a specific request, the message client MUST set *ResumeHandle* to zero. If this is not the first call in a sequence of calls for a specific request, the message client MUST set *ResumeHandle* to the value of *ResumeHandle* returned by the message server in the last call to NetrMessageNameEnum.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.8"></a>
#### 3.1.4.8 Receiving NetrMessageNameEnum

On receipt of this message, the [**message server**](#gt_message-server) SHOULD check an internal [**access control list (ACL)**](#gt_access-control-list-acl) to determine whether the message [**client**](#gt_client) is authorized to access the name list. If the ACL authorization check is performed, and the message client is not authorized to perform the operation, the message server MUST return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.<14>

Next, the message server MUST validate that the level passed in *InfoStruct* is either 0 or 1. If the level is any other value, the message server MUST return ERROR_INVALID_LEVEL.

If the message client specifies *PrefMaxLen* of 0xFFFFFFFF, the message server MUST attempt to return all names in a single buffer. Otherwise, if the message client specifies *Level* 0, and *PrefMaxLen* is larger than 11,776 bytes, the message server MUST return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.<15>

The message server MUST iterate through its name table in order, starting with the name in ordinal position *ResumeHandle*. If *ResumeHandle* is larger than the number of names in the name table, the message server MUST return NERR_Success.

For each registered name, the message server MUST add a structure that contains the name to a return buffer. The type of structure used MUST be based on the value of Level, and MUST be as specified in section [2.2.2.5](#Section_2.2.2.5).

If the message server fills its buffer before it has iterated through all registered names, it MUST:

- Return the buffer as *InfoStruct*.
- Set *ResumeHandle* to the ordinal value of the last copied name plus 1.
- Set *TotalEntries* to the number of names in the buffer.
- Return NERR_BufTooSmall.
If the last registered name is copied into the buffer, the message server MUST:

- Copy the buffer to *InfoStruct*.
- Set *TotalEntries* to the number of names in the buffer.
- Return NERR_Success.

- Server MUST truncate *MsgName* to 15 characters if *MsgName* is longer than 15 characters.
- Server MUST pad *MsgName* to 15 characters with the ASCII space character if *MsgName* is shorter than 15 characters.
- Server MUST remove the null terminator for *MsgName*, if present.
- Server MUST append the [**NetBIOS suffix**](#gt_netbios-suffix) value 0x03 to the converted *MsgName*.
Then the message server MUST check to see if *MsgName* is in the name table on any [**LANA**](#gt_local-area-network-adapter-lana). If *MsgName* is not in the name table on any LANA, the message server MUST return NERR_NotLocalName.

Next, the message server MUST validate that the level passed in *InfoStruct* is either 0 or 1. If *Level* is any other value, the message server MUST return ERROR_INVALID_LEVEL.

The message server MUST allocate memory for a structure to return information on the name. If the message server fails to allocate a buffer, the message server MUST return ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY.

The type of structure returned MUST be based on the value of *Level*; fields other than names in the structure MUST be populated as specified in section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2). The message server MUST return all names as [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) UTF-16 strings.

If the structure is successfully allocated and populated, the message server MUST return NERR_Success and return a pointer to the structure as *InfoStruct*.

#### 3.2.4.4 Sending Mailslot Messages or SMB Messages

Although this protocol has no methods for constructing or sending [**mailslot**](#gt_mailslot) messages or SMB messages, the [**message server**](#gt_message-server) MUST be able to receive such messages. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss how such messages are constructed.

The sender MUST select a recipient name (called *To*) for the message. *To* MUST be a valid [**NetBIOS name**](#gt_netbios-name) of type 0x03. *To* MUST not begin with an asterisk character.

The sender SHOULD provide a *From* name field, indicating the sender of the message. If no sender name is available, the sender SHOULD use the NetBIOS name of the local computer as the *From* field.

The sender SHOULD provide textual content for the message (called *Text*). *Text* MUST be represented in the [**OEM character set**](#gt_original-equipment-manufacturer-oem-character-set) and MUST be 652 bytes or less in length.

The sender MAY send the message to the mailslot \\recipient name\MAILSLOT\MESSNGR on all [**LANAs**](#gt_local-area-network-adapter-lana).

The sender MAY send the message as a directed SMB on each LANA, as defined in the following.

If the message text is 128 bytes or less in length, the sender SHOULD send the message as an [SMB_COM_SEND_MESSAGE](#Section_3.2.4.1) request message. The SMB_COM_SEND_MESSAGE request message MUST be constructed as follows:

- *From* MUST be a valid NetBIOS name.
- *From* MUST be converted to a null-terminated ASCII string and be placed in the **OriginatorName** field.
- *To* MUST be a valid NetBIOS name.
- *To* MUST be converted to a null-terminated ASCII string and be placed in the **DestinationName** field.
- *Text* MUST be placed in the **Data** buffer.
If the message text is more than 128 bytes in length, the sender SHOULD break the message text into 128-byte segments. In this case:

- The sender MUST send the first segment as an [SMB_COM_SEND_START_MB_MESSAGE](#Section_2.2.3.2.1) request message. The SMB_COM_SEND_START_MB_MESSAGE request message MUST be constructed as follows:
- *From* MUST be a valid NetBIOS name.
- *From* MUST be converted to a null-terminated ASCII string and be placed in the **OriginatorName** field.
- *To* MUST be a valid NetBIOS name.
- *To* MUST be converted to a null-terminated ASCII string and be placed in the **DestinationName** field.
- The sender SHOULD wait for the acknowledgment, an SMB_COM_SEND_START_MB_MESSAGE response message, before proceeding.
- The sender MUST send each additional segment as an [SMB_COM_SEND_TEXT_MB_MESSAGE](#Section_2.2.3.3.2) request message. The SMB_COM_SEND_TEXT_MB_MESSAGE request message MUST be constructed as follows:
- The **Data** field of each of these messages MUST contain sequential, contiguous segments of *Text*.
- Every segment of *Text* except the last SHOULD be exactly 128 bytes in length.
- The sender SHOULD NOT send additional segments until acknowledgment is received that the previous segment is received in the form of an SMB_COM_SEND_TEXT_MB_MESSAGE response message.
- After sending the last segment of *Text*, the sender MUST send an [SMB_COM_SEND_END_MB_MESSAGE](#Section_2.2.3.4) request message.<25>

#### 3.2.4.5 Receiving Mailslot Messages or SMB Messages

When the [**message server**](#gt_message-server) receives a [**mailslot**](#gt_mailslot) message, it MUST check the table of names it is maintaining for each [**LANA**](#gt_local-area-network-adapter-lana) to see whether the name supplied in the *To* parameter matches one of the names in the table. If there is a match, the message server SHOULD display the message in the *Text* parameter. The method of displaying the message is implementation-specific. A message server MAY impose security or other policies that control whether the message is displayed, the maximum length of a message, and so on.<26>

When the message server receives an SMB message, it MUST validate the name supplied in the *To* parameter against the table of names that it is maintaining for each LANA. If there is a match, the message server SHOULD display the message in the *Text* parameter. The method of displaying the message is implementation-specific. A message server MAY impose security or other policies that control whether the message is displayed, the maximum length of a message, and so on. On receiving and successfully processing any SMB request message, the message server MUST send the corresponding SMB response message back to the message [**client**](#gt_client).<27>

When the message server receives an SMB message, it MUST validate the SMB message, and, if the message is not valid, it MUST return an appropriate SMB error code.<28>

| Validation test | SMB error code to return if validation fails |
| --- | --- |
| Message size is greater than or equal to the size of a valid SMB header structure. | 2 |
| SMB protocol prefix = 0xFF. | 3 |
| SMB protocol = S M B. | 4 |
| SMB command matches expected function code. | 5 |
| SMB has the correct number of parameters for the function performed. | 6 |
| SMB header length is less than or equal to the length of the buffer containing the SMB. | 7 |
| Variable-length data block fields in the SMB payload are prefixed by \001 or \005. | 8 |
| Null-terminated dialect strings in the SMB payload are prefixed by \002. | 9 |
| Null-terminated path strings in the SMB payload are prefixed by \003. | 10 |
| Null-terminated strings in the SMB payload are prefixed by \004. | 11 |
| Total length of SMB message is less than or equal to the buffer used to contain the message. | 12 |

When the message server receives an SMB message, if it is unable to buffer the message, it MUST return SMB_ERR_NO_ROOM to the message client in an appropriate SMB reply message. If it is able to successfully buffer the message, it MUST return SMB_ERR_SUCCESS to the message client in an appropriate SMB reply message.

# 4 Protocol Examples

Consider two computers, PRINTSERVER (a print [**server**](#gt_server)) and WORKSTATION (a user's desktop). WORKSTATION has only one network interface card, which is on a physical network that is remote to PRINTSERVER, accessible by way of TCP/IP.

![Name management protocol flow diagram](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Name management protocol flow diagram

Example 1. The [**message server**](#gt_message-server) on WORKSTATION, during boot, registers the [**NetBIOS name**](#gt_netbios-name) "WORKSTATION [03]" with its sole [**LANA**](#gt_local-area-network-adapter-lana). The component that caused the name to be registered did so by using the [NetrMessageNameAdd](#Section_3.1.4.1) method of the name management protocol. The flow of this protocol is illustrated in Figure 1.

Example 2. A user "ALICE" logs on to WORKSTATION. The message server on WORKSTATION registers the NetBIOS name "ALICE [03]" with the LANA. The component that caused the name to be registered did so by using the NetrMessageNameAdd method of the name management protocol. The flow of this protocol is illustrated in Figure 1.

![Name management protocol flow diagram](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: Name management protocol flow diagram

Example 3. Subsequently, Alice uses some program to print a document. Through means unrelated to this example, the print job is delivered to the print server. On finishing its work, the print server needs to notify Alice. The print server selects among the three protocols available to it for message delivery. Because [**mailslots**](#gt_mailslot) and SMB use broadcast mechanisms, and, therefore, are suitable only for machines in the same collision domain, the print server selects the [NetrSendMessage](#Section_3.2.4.1) method of the message-sending protocol.

The print server constructs the message, setting *To* to Alice's NetBIOS name, *From* to its own NetBIOS name, and *Text* to the text Print Job Completed. The print server invokes the NetrSendMessage method that delivers the message to the message service on Alice's machine. The message service causes the text of the message to display on the console. The flow of this protocol is illustrated in Figure 2.

# 5 Security

Some interfaces in this protocol do not support remote authentication or authorization, and can potentially be abused to interfere with or cause spurious message delivery.

<a id="Section_5.1"></a>
## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

Because some interfaces of this protocol are unauthenticated and do not perform authorization, a service that receives and acts on messages in this protocol can be used by an attacker to cause unwanted notifications to a console user. This occurred in the Windows implementation of this protocol (for more information, see [[MSKB-330904]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89940)) and was not due to a code defect in the [**message server**](#gt_message-server) that acted on the protocol messages. It is recommended that this protocol not be implemented due to the lack of security features in the protocol.

# 7 Appendix B: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental software. References to product versions include released service packs.

- Windows 2000 operating system
- Windows XP operating system
- Windows Server 2003 operating system
Exceptions, if any, are noted below. If a service pack or Quick Fix Engineering (QFE) number appears with the product version, behavior changed in that service pack or QFE. The new behavior also applies to subsequent service packs of the product unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.6: The Messenger Service Remote Protocol has been present in Windows operating system products since before the release of Windows NT 4.0 operating system. In Windows 2000, the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over UDP delivery option was introduced. The protocol specified in this document was present through Windows Server 2003. Support for the protocol was disabled by default (but could be enabled by administrator action) for new installations of Windows Server 2003 operating system with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and Windows XP operating system Service Pack 2 (SP2). This protocol was supported only in Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003.

<2> Section 2.2.3: Windows uses whatever transport is bound to a particular [**local area network adapter (LANA)**](#gt_local-area-network-adapter-lana), and supports all of these transports.

<3> Section 2.2.3.1.1: Windows returns a 32-bit error code in the **Status** field when an SMB error occurs.

<4> Section 2.2.3.1.1: Windows always converts ASCII CR, LF, CRLF, and LFCR into a single 0x14 character.

<5> Section 2.2.3.2.1: Windows returns a 32-bit error code in the Status field when an SMB error occurs.

<6> Section 2.2.3.3.1: Windows returns a 32-bit error code in the Status field when an SMB error occurs.

<7> Section 2.2.3.3.1: Windows always converts ASCII CR, LF, CRLF, and LFCR into a single 0x14 character.

<8> Section 2.2.3.4.1: Windows returns a 32-bit error code in the Status field when an SMB error occurs.

<9> Section 3.1.1: The Windows implementation supports a table of up to 256 names for each LANA. Windows does not permit the deletion of the computer name from any LANA while the [**message server**](#gt_message-server) is running.

<10> Section 3.1.4.4: Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 both limit the MsgName parameter to 16 characters, including the terminating null character, when calling NetrMessageNameDel(). If the MsgName is longer than 16 characters, the server returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER. Windows 2000 does not check the length of the MsgName parameter when calling NetrMessageNameDel() but reads in only the first 255 characters.

<11> Section 3.1.4.5: Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 both limit the *MsgName* parameter to 16 characters, including the terminating null character, when calling [NetrMessageNameAdd()](#Section_3.1.4.1). If the *MsgName* is longer than 16 characters, the server returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER. Windows 2000 does not check the length of the *MsgName* parameter when calling NetrMessageNameAdd() but reads in only the first 255 characters.

<12> Section 3.1.4.6: Windows implementations require that the message client be an administrator or a local user of the machine.

<13> Section 3.1.4.6: The name table for each LANA on Windows can hold up to 256 entries.

<14> Section 3.1.4.8: Windows implementations require that the message client be an administrator or a local user of the machine.

<15> Section 3.1.4.8: If the message client specifies *Level* 0, and *PrefMaxLen* is larger than 11,776 bytes, a Windows 2000 Server operating system message server returns ERROR_SUCCESS.

<16> Section 3.1.4.9: Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 both limit the *MsgName* parameter to 16 characters, including the terminating null character, when calling [NetrMessageNameGetInfo()](#Section_3.1.4.9). If the *MsgName* is longer than 16 characters, the server returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER. Windows 2000 does not check the length of the *MsgName* parameter when calling NetrMessageNameGetInfo() but reads in only the first 255 characters.

<17> Section 3.1.4.10: Windows implementations require that the message client be an administrator or a local user of the machine.

<18> Section 3.1.4.11: Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 both limit the *MsgName* parameter to 16 characters, including the terminating null character, when calling [NetrMessageNameDel()](#Section_3.1.4.4). If the *MsgName* is longer than 16 characters, the server returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER. Windows 2000 does not check the length of the *MsgName* parameter when calling NetrMessageNameDel() but reads in only the first 255 characters.

<19> Section 3.1.4.12: Windows implementations require that the message client be an administrator or a local user of the machine.

<20> Section 3.1.4.12: If *MsgName* is the name of the computer, a Windows Server 2003 message server returns ERROR_SUCCESS.

<21> Section 3.2.4.1: hRpcBinding is an interface field, not a wire field, and was implicit rather than explicit in the interface prior to Windows XP. In Windows XP, the interface was changed to add the explicit RPC binding handle. The RPC binding handle is never seen in messages on the network.

<22> Section 3.2.4.1: This error is returned by Windows Vista operating system, Windows Server 2008 operating system, Windows 7 operating system, and Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system, to indicate that that the method is not supported by those versions.

<23> Section 3.2.4.2: Windows-based clients format the name specified in the *To* parameter as the [**NetBIOS name**](#gt_netbios-name) of the recipient (with [**NetBIOS suffix**](#gt_netbios-suffix) value 0x03) and use that to form the binding handle. For information on how the name can be truncated or padded, see section 3.1.4.1.

<24> Section 3.2.4.3: When the message server receives a message for a registered recipient name, the message server causes the message to be displayed on the console of the interactive user of the machine. The maximum message length that displays is 4,095 characters.

<25> Section 3.2.4.4: Windows sends messages of up to 128 bytes using [SMB_COM_SEND_MESSAGE](#Section_3.2.4.1) and uses the multiblock SMB sequence for messages larger than 128 bytes. When a message is more than 128 bytes, Windows breaks the messages into 128-byte segments prior to transmission. Where a behavior is defined as SHOULD, Windows implements that behavior.

The Windows implementation of the message client for the protocols defined in this document rejects messages sent to the recipient name *.

For recipient names that end in an asterisk, Windows attempts to deliver the message through mailslots.

For recipient names that do not end in an asterisk, Windows attempts to deliver the message by way of SMB.

If message delivery over SMB is attempted and fails, Windows attempts to deliver the message by way of a call to [NetrSendMessage](#Section_3.2.4.1).

<26> Section 3.2.4.5: When the message server receives a mailslot message for a registered recipient name, the message server causes the message to be displayed on the console of the interactive user of the machine. The maximum message length that displays is 4,095 characters.

<27> Section 3.2.4.5: When the message server receives an SMB message for a registered recipient name, the message server causes the message to be displayed on the console of the interactive user of the machine. The maximum message length that displays is 4,095 characters.

<28> Section 3.2.4.5: If the message client is unable to validate the SMB, it returns NERR_NetworkError.
