# 1 Introduction

Active Directory Web Services: Data Model and Common Elements contains an XML data model and other protocol components (such as the definition of an XPath 1.0-derived selection language) that are used in various protocols that belong to the set of Active Directory Web Services protocols. The documentation for individual protocols contains references to this document, as needed.

Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose [**directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds), which uses [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) as its primary access protocol. [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) stores information about a variety of objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md). [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is either deployed as [**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**](#gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds) or [**Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)**](#gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds), which are both described in [MS-ADOD](../MS-ADOD/MS-ADOD.md): Active Directory Protocols Overview.

<a id="gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds"></a>
**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**: A [**directory service (DS)**](#gt_directory-service-ds) implemented by a domain controller (DC). The [**DS**](#gt_directory-service-ds) provides a data store for objects that is distributed across multiple DCs. The DCs interoperate as peers to ensure that a local change to an object replicates correctly across DCs. AD DS is a deployment of [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

<a id="gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds"></a>
**Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)**: A [**directory service (DS)**](#gt_directory-service-ds) implemented by a domain controller (DC). AD LDS is a deployment of [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) [MS-ADTS]. The most significant difference between [**AD LDS**](#gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds) and [**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**](#gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds) is that [**AD LDS**](#gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds) does not host domain naming contexts (domain NCs). A server can host multiple [**AD LDS**](#gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds) DCs. Each DC is an independent [**AD LDS**](#gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds) instance, with its own independent state. [**AD LDS**](#gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds) can be run as an operating system [**DS**](#gt_directory-service-ds) or as a directory service provided by a standalone application (Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM)).

<a id="gt_attribute-syntax"></a>
**attribute syntax**: Specifies the format and range of permissible values of an attribute. The syntax of an attribute is defined by several attributes on the attributeSchema object, as specified in [MS-ADTS] section 3.1.1.2. Attribute syntaxes supported by [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) include Boolean, Enumeration, Integer, LargeInteger, String(UTC-Time), Object(DS-DN), and String(Unicode).

<a id="gt_directory-object"></a>
**directory object**: A [**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) object, as specified in [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325), that is a specialization of an object.

<a id="gt_directory-service-ds"></a>
**directory service (DS)**: A service that stores and organizes information about a computer network's users and network shares, and that allows network administrators to manage users' access to the shares. See also [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory).

<a id="gt_directory-tree"></a>
**directory tree**: An [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) [**directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds) is organized into a hierarchical tree structure in which each [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object) has exactly one parent [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object) (except for one object that serves as the root of the tree) and zero or more child [**directory objects**](#gt_directory-object).

<a id="gt_distinguished-name-dn"></a>
**distinguished name (DN)**: A name that uniquely identifies an object by using the [**relative distinguished name (RDN)**](#gt_relative-distinguished-name-rdn) for the object, and the names of container objects and domains that contain the object. The distinguished name (DN) identifies the object and its location in a tree.

<a id="gt_endpoint"></a>
**endpoint**: In the context of a web service, a network target to which a [**SOAP**](#gt_soap) message can be addressed. See [[WSADDR]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=113065).

<a id="gt_global-catalog-gc"></a>
**global catalog (GC)**: A unified partial view of multiple [**naming contexts (NCs)**](#gt_naming-context-nc) in a distributed partitioned directory. The [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) directory service [**GC**](#gt_global-catalog-gc) is implemented by GC servers. The definition of [**global catalog**](#gt_global-catalog-gc) is specified in [MS-ADTS] section 3.1.1.1.8.

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with [**universally unique identifier (UUID)**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also [**universally unique identifier (UUID)**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid).

<a id="gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap"></a>
**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**: The primary access protocol for [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory). Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an industry-standard protocol, established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which allows users to query and update information in a [**directory service (DS)**](#gt_directory-service-ds), as described in [MS-ADTS]. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol can be either version 2 [[RFC1777]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90290) or version 3 [[RFC3377]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91337).

<a id="gt_naming-context-nc"></a>
**naming context (NC)**: An [**NC**](#gt_naming-context-nc) is a set of objects organized as a tree. It is referenced by a DSName. The [**DN**](#gt_distinguished-name-dn) of the DSName is the distinguishedName attribute of the tree root. The [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) of the DSName is the objectGUID attribute of the tree root. The security identifier (SID) of the DSName, if present, is the objectSid attribute of the tree root; for [**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**](#gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds), the SID is present if and only if the [**NC**](#gt_naming-context-nc) is a domain naming context (domain NC). [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) supports organizing several [**NCs**](#gt_naming-context-nc) into a tree structure.

<a id="gt_object-reference-property"></a>
**object reference property**: In Active Directory Web Services, this is the property that uniquely identifies a [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object). It can be expressed as either a [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) or as a [**distinguished name**](#gt_distinguished-name-dn).

<a id="gt_object-reference-syntax"></a>
**object reference syntax**: An [**attribute syntax**](#gt_attribute-syntax) that supports object references. The five object reference syntaxes are specified in [MS-ADTS] section 3.1.1.1.6, and the referential integrity constraints around attributes with these syntaxes are specified in [MS-ADTS] section 3.1.1.2.2.3.

<a id="gt_relative-distinguished-name-rdn"></a>
**relative distinguished name (RDN)**: In the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) directory service, the unique name of a child element relative to its parent in Active Directory. The RDN of a child element combined with the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the parent forms the FQDN of the child.

<a id="gt_soap"></a>
**SOAP**: A lightweight protocol for exchanging structured information in a decentralized, distributed environment. [**SOAP**](#gt_soap) uses XML technologies to define an extensible messaging framework, which provides a message construct that can be exchanged over a variety of underlying protocols. The framework has been designed to be independent of any particular programming model and other implementation-specific semantics. SOAP 1.2 supersedes SOAP 1.1. See [[SOAP1.2-1/2003]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90521).

<a id="gt_soap-fault"></a>
**SOAP fault**: A container for error and status information within a [**SOAP message**](#gt_soap-message). See [[SOAP1.2-1/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94664) section 5.4 for more information.

<a id="gt_soap-header"></a>
**SOAP header**: A mechanism for implementing extensions to a [**SOAP message**](#gt_soap-message) in a decentralized manner without prior agreement between the communicating parties. See [SOAP1.2-1/2007] section 5.2 for more information.

<a id="gt_soap-message"></a>
**SOAP message**: An XML document consisting of a mandatory SOAP envelope, an optional [**SOAP header**](#gt_soap-header), and a mandatory SOAP body. See [SOAP1.2-1/2007] section 5 for more information.

<a id="gt_synthetic-attribute"></a>
**synthetic attribute**: In Active Directory Web Services, an attribute that is part of the XML view of a [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object) but which is not part of the [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object) as stored in the [**directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds).

<a id="gt_transport-layer-security-tls"></a>
**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: A security protocol that supports confidentiality and integrity of messages in client and server applications communicating over open networks. TLS supports server and, optionally, client authentication by using X.509 certificates (as specified in [[X509]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90590)). TLS is standardized in the IETF TLS working group.

<a id="gt_uniform-resource-identifier-uri"></a>
**Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**: A string that identifies a resource. The URI is an addressing mechanism defined in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax [[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453).

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and RPC objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as [**globally unique identifiers (GUIDs)**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [RFC4122] or [C706] must be used for generating the UUID.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

Active Directory Web Services (ADWS) permits access to [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) via the use of common [**SOAP**](#gt_soap)-based Web Service protocols such as WS-Transfer [[WXFR]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90587) and WS-Enumeration [[WSENUM]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90580). These protocols operate on an XML [[XML10]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90600) view of the data stored in the Active Directory [**directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds). The same XML view is shared by all the protocols in the ADWS protocol set. This document specifies that shared XML view.

Additionally, the protocols share a selection language, derived from XPath 1.0 [[XPATH]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90611), that is used to specify which aspect of the XML view is operated on. That shared selection language is also specified in this document.

This document also specifies other shared cross-protocol aspects of ADWS, such as the [**endpoints**](#gt_endpoint) used and shared [**SOAP headers**](#gt_soap-header) and [**SOAP fault**](#gt_soap-fault) details [[SOAP1.2-1/2003]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90521).

Finally, this document provides a mechanism for performing a range retrieval operation through some Web Service protocols in the ADWS protocol set. Range retrieval, as specified in section [2.7](#Section_1.3), allows for returning only a portion of the complete set of values of a multivalued attribute, or specifying that only a certain portion of the set of values of a multivalued attribute be retrieved. For the same purpose, it defines an extension to the shared XML view of data that incorporates this range retrieval extension.

Note that this document does not define a protocol. Rather, it serves as a common repository for information used across the entire ADWS protocol set. For operations such as range retrieval, it provides common extensions to [WXFR] and [WSENUM], which are used by certain protocols within the ADWS protocol set.<1>

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Protocols and Other Structures

The information in this document is used by protocols in the set of Active Directory Web Services protocols. The ADWS protocol documentation set comprises this document and the following documents: [MS-WSDS](../MS-WSDS/MS-WSDS.md), [MS-WSPELD](../MS-WSPELD/MS-WSPELD.md), [MS-WSTIM](../MS-WSTIM/MS-WSTIM.md), and [MS-ADCAP](../MS-ADCAP/MS-ADCAP.md).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Applicability Statement

The XML data model and XPath 1.0-derived selection language is suitable for use when the implementer desires to retrieve and manipulate data stored in a [**directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds) via an XML-based model. It can be particularly useful with protocols, such as many [**SOAP**](#gt_soap)-based Web Service protocols, that are intended to operate over data that is represented as an XML document.

There is an implicit assumption in the design of the data model that the directory service exposes semantics similar to that of a [**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) version 3 directory service [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325). For example, it assumes that objects in the directory consist of attribute-value pairs in which each attribute can have one or more values. It also assumes that the [**directory objects**](#gt_directory-object) can be arranged in a single hierarchical tree structure. The XML data model described in this document might not be suitable for use with directories that do not expose such semantics.

# 2 Data Model and Common Elements

This section discusses the shared protocol elements that are used by various protocols in the set of Active Directory Web Service protocols. In this document, the convention from [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 3.1.1.1.2 is adopted such that, if variable *O* refers to a [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object) and a is the [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) display name of an attribute, then *O*!a denotes the value or values of attribute a on object *O*.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Endpoints

This section specifies the Web Service [**endpoints**](#gt_endpoint) that are used by protocols in the ADWS protocol set. ADWS exposes protocols that can be accessed via an endpoint. Each endpoint can be uniquely identified by a [**Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**](#gt_uniform-resource-identifier-uri). The URIs for the ADWS protocols are shown in the following table. All endpoints use the "net.tcp" URI binding type. For semantics of this binding type, see [MS-NMFTB](../MS-NMFTB/MS-NMFTB.md).

| Endpoint URI | Protocol exposed by endpoint | Authentication mechanism (see below) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| net.tcp://localhost:9389/ActiveDirectoryWebServices/Windows/Resource | [[WXFR]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90587), [MS-WSTIM](../MS-WSTIM/MS-WSTIM.md) | Windows Integrated |

In the preceding table, "localhost" represents the DNS hostname of the server hosting the endpoint. All endpoints listen on TCP port 9389.

The ADWS protocol set uses two types of authentication. Each endpoint (except for the "mex" endpoint) supports one or the other. The forms of authentication are:

- Windows Integrated: These endpoints use integrated Windows authentication with the .Net Negotiate Stream protocol [MS-NNS](../MS-NNS/MS-NNS.md) to authenticate the client and provide message security at the transport layer.
- Username/password: These endpoints use [**TLS**](#gt_transport-layer-security-tls) to protect the TCP transport. TLS is used to negotiate a session key to protect the TCP transport. The client authenticates (at the message layer) to the server by providing a plaintext username and password, as documented in WS-Security [[WSS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=130727) and the WS-Security UserNameToken profile [[WSSUTP1.1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131549).
The "mex" endpoint neither requires nor supports authentication.

## 2.2 XML Namespaces and URIs

The following XML namespaces are defined and referenced by the ADWS protocol set, using the XML namespace mechanisms defined in [[XMLNS-2ED]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90602). A brief informative summary of each namespace is included in the table below. The detailed usage and semantics of each namespace are explained in the portion of the document that makes use of it. Some namespaces are used by multiple ADWS protocols or protocol components. Although this specification associates a specific XML namespace prefix for each XML namespace that is used, the choice of any particular XML namespace prefix is implementation-specific and is not significant for interoperability.

| Prefix | Namespace URI | Informative summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ad: | http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory | The core ADWS namespace. Most ADWS protocol elements are located in this namespace. |
| addata: | http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory/Data | The namespace for ADWS protocol elements that correspond to the [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) display names of [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) classes and attributes. |
| adlq: | http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory/Dialect/LdapQuery | The LdapQuery language, defined in [MS-WSDS](../MS-WSDS/MS-WSDS.md). |
| da: | http://schemas.microsoft.com/2006/11/IdentityManagement/DirectoryAccess | The namespace for the [MS-WSTIM](../MS-WSTIM/MS-WSTIM.md) protocol. |
| ca: | http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory/CustomActions | The namespace for the [MS-ADCAP](../MS-ADCAP/MS-ADCAP.md) protocol. |

Additionally, ADWS defines the following three [**URIs**](#gt_uniform-resource-identifier-uri) which do not correspond to XML namespaces.

| URI | Informative summary |
| --- | --- |
| http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory/Data/fault | The fault action URI [[SOAP1.2-1/2003]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90521) for ADWS-defined [**SOAP**](#gt_soap) faults, excluding those defined by [MS-WSTIM] (used for the "[Action]" property of [[WSASB]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=120449)). |
| http://schemas.microsoft.com/2006/11/IdentityManagement/DirectoryAccess/fault | The fault action URI [SOAP1.2-1/2003] for SOAP faults defined by [MS-WSTIM] protocol (used for the "[Action]" property of [WSASB]). |
| http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory/Dialect/XPath-Level-1 | The name of the XPath 1.0-derived selection language defined in section [2.4](#Section_2.4). |

Although not defined by ADWS, the following XML namespaces are referenced elsewhere in this document.

| Prefix | Namespace URI | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| soapenv: | http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope | [SOAP1.2-1/2003] |

<a id="Section_2.3"></a>
## 2.3 XML Data Model

This section documents how [**directory objects**](#gt_directory-object), each of which is a collection of [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) attributes (with one or more values stored in each attribute) [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md), are represented in XML. This XML view of directory objects is shared by the protocols in the ADWS protocol set.

<a id="Section_2.3.1"></a>
### 2.3.1 Object Naming

In the ADWS data model, [**directory objects**](#gt_directory-object) are identified by their [**object reference property**](#gt_object-reference-property). The object reference property can be either a [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) or the object's [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) [**distinguished name**](#gt_distinguished-name-dn).

**Note** Unless otherwise specified, GUID values are represented using the following forms in this document:

- In the descriptive text, GUID values are represented by Curly Braced String form defined in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.3.4.3.
- In the XML examples and definitions, GUID values are represented by the string form of a [**universally unique identifier (UUID)**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid), as specified in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) section 3.
For a directory object *O*, to specify the object reference property of *O* as a GUID, the value of the GUID MUST equal the value of *O*!objectGUID. Alternatively, the object reference property of *O* can be specified as *O*'s LDAP distinguished name (*O*!distinguishedName) instead.

The object reference property (in either GUID or distinguished name form) in a [**SOAP message**](#gt_soap-message) request identifies the directory object that should be operated on by the operation specified in that message (see section [2.5.2](#Section_2.3.3.1)). The object reference property in a [**SOAP**](#gt_soap) response message indicates the identity of a directory object that is returned in that response message.

The object reference property value in the GUID form of {11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111} exclusively refers to the LDAP rootDSE [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325).

The following SOAP message requests use the object reference property as either the GUID or the distinguished name:

- In adlq:BaseObject in LdapQuery [MS-WSDS](../MS-WSDS/MS-WSDS.md)
- In the ad:objectReferenceProperty [**SOAP header**](#gt_soap-header) for a WS-Transfer [[WXFR]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90587) Get, Put, or Delete operation (section 2.5.2)
- In the ad:objectReferenceProperty SOAP header for a [MS-WSTIM](../MS-WSTIM/MS-WSTIM.md) BaseObjectSearchRequest or ModifyRequest operation (section 2.5.2)
- As the value of a directory attribute which has an [**object reference syntax**](#gt_object-reference-syntax) (see [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md), section 3.1.1.1.6)
- In the ad:container-hierarchy-parent (see section [2.3.3.2](#Section_2.3.3.2)) [**synthetic attribute**](#gt_synthetic-attribute) for a WS-Transfer Put or Create operation
- In the ad:container-hierarchy-parent (see section 2.3.3.2) synthetic attribute for a [MS-WSTIM] ModifyRequest or AddRequest operation
The object reference property in a protocol response can be in either GUID or distinguished name form.

<a id="Section_2.3.2"></a>
### 2.3.2 XML View of Directory Objects

In the XML view of the [**directory objects**](#gt_directory-object) presented by ADWS, the XML elements are named for the [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) classes and attributes used in the directory object. Additionally, XML elements are used to represent the ADWS [**synthetic attributes**](#gt_synthetic-attribute), described in the next section.

Begin by defining how a single LDAP attribute and its value(s) are represented in the XML view. Let *A* be the LDAP display name of an attribute that has values *V1(A)*...*Vn(A)*. Let *S1(A)*...*Sn(A)* be the XML representation of values *V1*...*Vn* as described in section [2.3.4](#Section_2.3.4). Let *LDAPSYN(A)* be the LDAP [**attribute syntax**](#gt_attribute-syntax) of attribute *A*, and let *XMLSYN(A)* be the corresponding XML syntax, as described in section 2.3.4. The XML representation for this attribute is the following.

<addata:A LdapSyntax="LDAPSYN(A)">

<ad:value xsi:type="XMLSYN(A)">

S1(A)

</ad:value>

...

...

<ad:value xsi:type="XMLSYN(A)">

Sn(A)

</ad:value>

</addata:A>

Now extend this view to an entire directory object. Let *O* be an object in the directory. Let *C* be the LDAP display name of the most specific structural object class ([MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 3.1.1.1.4) of *O*. Let *A1*...*An* be the LDAP display names of all the LDAP attributes of *O*. Then, the representation of *O* as the XML view in the data model is the following.

<addata:C>

<addata:A1 LdapSyntax="LDAPSYN(A1)">

<ad:value xsi:type="XMLSYN(A1)">

S1(A1)

</ad:value>

...

...

<ad:value xsi:type="XMLSYN(A1)">

Sn(A1)

</ad:value>

</addata:A1>

...

...

<addata:An LdapSyntax="LDAPSYN(An)">

<ad:value xsi:type="XMLSYN(An)">

S1(An)

</ad:value>

...

...

<ad:value xsi:type="XMLSYN(An)">

Sn(An)

</ad:value>

</addata:An>

</addata:C>

Not shown in the above example are the ADWS synthetic attributes. These are shown in the next section.

The root element is named for the LDAP display name of the most specific structural object class of *O*, and is in the http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory/Data XML namespace. When representing an LDAP display name where the most specific structural object class of *O* is not available, "top" is used for the name of the root element. Additionally, when representing the LDAP rootDse, "top" is used for the name of the root element.

Each child element represents a single LDAP attribute stored on that object and is named for that attribute's LDAP display name (and is also located in the http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory/Data XML namespace). This element can have an XML attribute named LdapSyntax that represents the LDAP attribute syntax of that LDAP attribute. Each child element under an attribute represents a single value stored in that attribute. The actual value is represented as a text node under this ad:value element.

The LdapSyntax XML attribute is present for each LDAP attribute specified in a [**SOAP**](#gt_soap) response, including the above XML representation of a directory object.

The LdapSyntax XML attribute is optional in a SOAP request.

Multiple directory objects are represented as sibling XML elements, regardless of the hierarchical relationship between the objects in the LDAP [**directory tree**](#gt_directory-tree).

<a id="Section_2.3.3"></a>
### 2.3.3 Synthetic Attributes

In addition to containing the [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) attributes of a [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object), the XML view of that object contains up to four additional attributes that are not part of that object's representation stored in the [**directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds) (that is, the four attributes are constructed by the server implementing the ADWS protocol set). These are referred to as the [**synthetic attributes**](#gt_synthetic-attribute) of ADWS. They can be distinguished from LDAP attributes because the elements that represent the synthetic attributes have names that are in the http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory XML namespace rather than in the http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory/Data XML namespace that is used for LDAP attributes and classes. Additionally, the LdapSyntax XML attribute is never included in the XML representation of a synthetic attribute.

The four synthetic attributes are specified in the following subsections.

<a id="Section_2.3.3.1"></a>
#### 2.3.3.1 ad:objectReferenceProperty

The [**synthetic attribute**](#gt_synthetic-attribute) ad:objectReferenceProperty contains the [**object reference property**](#gt_object-reference-property) of the [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object), as described in section [2.3.1](#Section_2.3.1). Values of this attribute have xsi:type equal to "xsd:string".

This attribute is read only.

This attribute is optional.<2>

The following is an example of the ad:objectReferenceProperty synthetic attribute as it would be found in the XML view of a directory object. In this example, the object reference property is in the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) form.

<ad:objectReferenceProperty>

<ad:value xsi:type="xsd:string">

e4f8a504-d7df-4b63-a636-5642d3bf1cf6

</ad:value>

</ad:objectReferenceProperty>

<a id="Section_2.3.3.2"></a>
#### 2.3.3.2 ad:container-hierarchy-parent

The [**synthetic attribute**](#gt_synthetic-attribute) ad:container-hierarchy-parent contains the [**object reference property**](#gt_object-reference-property) (as described in section [2.3.1](#Section_2.3.1)) of the [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object) that is the object's parent in the [**directory tree**](#gt_directory-tree). If the directory object has no parent (that is, if it is the root of its [**naming context**](#gt_naming-context-nc)), this attribute is omitted from the object's XML view.<3> Values of this attribute have xsi:type equal to "xsd:string".

This attribute can be modified. When this attribute is modified, the object's location in the directory is made consistent with the value of this attribute.

The following is an example of the ad:container-hierarchy-parent synthetic attribute as it would be found in the XML view of a directory object. In this example, the object reference property is in the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) form.

<ad:container-hierarchy-parent>

<ad:value xsi:type="xsd:string">

d8f7a25a-26f5-4463-bbe3-aa01e4002afd

</ad:value>

</ad:container-hierarchy-parent>

<a id="Section_2.3.3.3"></a>
#### 2.3.3.3 ad:distinguishedName

The [**synthetic attribute**](#gt_synthetic-attribute) ad:distinguishedName contains the [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) [**distinguished name**](#gt_distinguished-name-dn) of the [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object); that is, the value of *O*!distinguishedName where *O* is the directory object being represented as a XML view. Values of this attribute have xsi:type equal to "xsd:string".

This attribute is read only.

The following is an example of the ad:distinguishedName synthetic attribute as it would be found in the XML view of a directory object.

<ad:distinguishedName>

<ad:value xsi:type="xsd:string">CN=Test,DC=fabrikam,DC=com</ad:value>

</ad:distinguishedName>

<a id="Section_2.3.3.4"></a>
#### 2.3.3.4 ad:relativeDistinguishedName

The [**synthetic attribute**](#gt_synthetic-attribute) ad:relativeDistinguishedName contains the [**relative distinguished name**](#gt_relative-distinguished-name-rdn) of the [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object). Values of this attribute have xsi:type equal to "xsd:string".

This attribute can be modified. When this attribute is modified, the object's relative distinguished name is made consistent with the value of this attribute.

The following is an example of the ad:relativeDistinguishedName synthetic attribute as it would be found in the XML view of a directory object.

<ad:relativeDistinguishedName>

<ad:value xsi:type="xsd:string">CN=Test</ad:value>

</ad:relativeDistinguishedName>

<a id="Section_2.3.4"></a>
### 2.3.4 Syntax Mapping

As mentioned in section [2.3.2](#Section_2.3.2), the content of the <ad:value> element is the value of the directory attribute (or [**synthetic attribute**](#gt_synthetic-attribute)) represented as an XML value. For [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) directory attributes, the choice of the XML syntax for this value (and thus, the corresponding textual representation of that XML value) is dependent on the [**attribute syntax**](#gt_attribute-syntax) of the LDAP directory attribute. This mapping is specified in the following table. *LDAPSYN* and *XMLSYN* refer to the variables of the same names used in section 2.3.2. The attribute syntaxes are as specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 3.1.1.2.2.2.

| LDAP attribute syntax | LDAPSYN | XML syntax (XMLSYN) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Boolean | Boolean | xsd:string |
| Enumeration | Enumeration | xsd:string |
| Integer | Integer | xsd:string |
| LargeInteger | LargeInteger | xsd:string |
| Object(Access-Point) | AccessPoint | xsd:string |
| Object(DN-String) | DNString | xsd:string |
| Object(OR-Name) | ORName | xsd:string |
| Object(DN-Binary) | DNBinary | xsd:string |
| Object(DS-DN) | DSDNString | xsd:string |
| Object(Presentation-Address) | PresentationAddress | xsd:string |
| Object(Replica-Link) | ReplicaLink | xsd:base64Binary |
| String(Case) | CaseString | xsd:string |
| String(IA5) | IA5String | xsd:string |
| String(NT-Sec-Desc) | NTSecurityDescriptor | xsd:base64Binary |
| String(Numeric) | NumericString | xsd:string |
| String(Object-Identifier) | ObjectIdentifier | xsd:string |
| String(Octet) | OctetString | xsd:base64Binary |
| String(Printable) | PrintableString | xsd:string |
| String(Sid) | SidString | xsd:base64Binary |
| String(Teletex) | TeletexString | xsd:string |
| String(Unicode) | UnicodeString | xsd:string |
| String(UTC-Time) | UTCTimeString | xsd:string |
| String(Generalized-Time) | GeneralizedTimeString | xsd:string |

The LDAP directory attributes located on the LDAP rootDse do not have attribute syntaxes defined for them. Mappings between an implementation's **rootDse** attributes and XML syntaxes is implementation specific. <4>

For the synthetic attributes, the choice of XML syntax is as specified in the following table.

| Synthetic attribute | XML syntax (XMLSYN) |
| --- | --- |
| [ad:objectReferenceProperty](#Section_2.3.3.1) | xsd:string |
| [ad:container-hierarchy-parent](#Section_2.3.3.2) | xsd:string |
| [ad:distinguishedName](#Section_2.3.3.3) | xsd:string |
| [ad:relativeDistinguishedName](#Section_2.3.3.4) | xsd:string |

<a id="Section_2.4"></a>
## 2.4 XPath 1.0-Derived Selection Language

Some Web Service protocols in the ADWS protocol set require the use of a selection language to specify which portion of the [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object) to operate on. In other words, the selection language permits the requestor to specify that only certain attributes are to be retrieved from the directory object (rather than every attribute) or to specify that a particular attribute or attribute value is to be added, replaced, or removed from a directory object.

The ADWS protocol set uses a selection language that is derived from XPath 1.0 [[XPATH]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90611) for this purpose. This selection language is applied to the XML view (described in section [2.3.2](#Section_2.3.2)) of the directory object. A compliant implementation need only implement the subset of the language described in this section. This derived language is identified by the following [**URI**](#gt_uniform-resource-identifier-uri):

http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory/Dialect/XPath-Level-1

For simplicity, this language will be referred to as "XpathSelection" in the remainder of this section.

The grammar for XpathSelection is shown below in ABNF notation.

XpathSelection = (root elements)

root = "/"

elements = (element [additional-element] [selection-predicate])

additional-element = ("/" element)

element = QName

selection-predicate = ("[" value-element "=" value "]")

value-element = (Prefix ":value") / "value"

value = qdstring

Where qdstring is defined in [[RFC2252]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90326) section 4.1 and QName and Prefix are defined in [[XMLNS-2ED]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90602) section 4.

The value-element is the string literal "value" qualified with an XML namespace prefix that corresponds to the XML namespace URI "http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory" in the scope of the XML node in which the XpathSelection expression appears. This is illustrated in the following example.

<node1 xmlns:ad="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory">

/element1/element2[ad:value="abc"]

</node1>

Without the selection-predicate, an XpathSelection expression is analogous to an XPath 1.0 absolute location path with one or two location steps along the child axis. The expression "/X" selects the XML element named "X" whose parent is the root node of the XML document. The expression "/X/Y" selects the XML element named "Y" whose parent is the XML element named "X" whose parent, in turn, is the root node of the document. For example, given the following XML document:

<addata:user>

<addata:description LdapType="UnicodeString">

<ad:value xsi:type="xsd:string">

First sample description

</ad:value>

<ad:value xsi:type="xsd:string">

Second sample description

</ad:value>

</addata:description>

</addata:user>

The XpathSelection expression "/addata:user" selects the entire <addata:user> element (including child elements), while the XpathSelection expression "/addata:user/addata:description" selects the following portion.

<addata:description LdapType="UnicodeString">

<ad:value xsi:type="xsd:string">

First sample description

</ad:value>

<ad:value xsi:type="xsd:string">

Second sample description

</ad:value>

</addata:description>

However, unlike an XPath 1.0 expression, the comparison of the LocalPart of the QName is done in a case-insensitive manner. For example, the following XpathSelection expressions are equivalent:

/addata:user/addata:description

/addata:USER/addata:DESCRIPTION

/addata:User/addata:Description

The inclusion of a selection-predicate allows an individual <ad:value> element to be specified. The predicate "[ad:value="X"]" matches the <ad:value> element whose child text node is equal to "X". The equality comparison is done using a comparison operation appropriate to the [**attribute syntax**](#gt_attribute-syntax) of the directory attribute, as specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 3.1.1.2.2.4 (for example, values for attributes that are of type String(case) in the directory are compared using a case-insensitive string comparison, while values of type Integer are compared as integers).

Using the previous XML document, the XpathSelection expression "/addata:user/addata:description[ad:value="First sample description"]" selects the following portion.

<ad:value xsi:type="xsd:string">

First sample description

</ad:value>

<a id="Section_2.5"></a>
## 2.5 Common SOAP Headers

The following sections describe [**SOAP headers**](#gt_soap-header) that are defined by the ADWS protocol set. These headers, and the ADWS protocols that use them, are summarized in the following table.

| SOAP 1.2 header (with namespace prefix) | Informative summary | Protocols in which header is used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ad:instance | Specifies the [**directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds) against which the operation is to be performed. | [[WXFR]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90587) [MS-WSTIM](../MS-WSTIM/MS-WSTIM.md) [[WSENUM]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90580)/[MS-WSDS](../MS-WSDS/MS-WSDS.md) |
| ad:objectReferenceProperty | Specifies the [**object reference property**](#gt_object-reference-property) of the [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object) against which the operation is to be performed. | [WXFR] [MS-WSTIM] |

<a id="Section_2.5.1"></a>
### 2.5.1 ad:instance Header

An implementation can allow multiple [**directory services**](#gt_directory-service-ds) to be accessed via a single [**endpoint**](#gt_endpoint).<5> The ad:instance [**SOAP header**](#gt_soap-header), which is located in the http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory XML namespace, is included in a [**SOAP**](#gt_soap) request message to specify which directory service the request is intended for.

The content of the ad:instance header is the string literal "ldap:" followed by an integer (expressed as a string in base 10) that specifies the TCP port number of the desired directory service's [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) interface.

In the following example, the requestor is asking that the operation (a WS-Transfer Get [[WXFR]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90587)) that is specified in the [**SOAP message**](#gt_soap-message) be performed against the directory service that listens on port 3268.

The ad:objectReferenceProperty [**SOAP header**](#gt_soap-header), which is located in the http://schemas.microsoft.com/2008/1/ActiveDirectory XML namespace, is attached to a [**SOAP**](#gt_soap) request message to specify the [**object reference property**](#gt_object-reference-property) of the [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object) against which the operation specified in the [**SOAP message**](#gt_soap-message) is to be performed. For example, if the SOAP message specifies a WS-Transfer Get operation [[WXFR]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90587), the ad:objectReferenceProperty header specifies the directory object that is to be returned.

The content of the ad:objectReferenceProperty header is the directory object's object reference property in either [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) or [**distinguished name**](#gt_distinguished-name-dn) form, as specified in section [2.3.1](#Section_2.3.1). For example, in the following request, the requestor is asking that the operation (a WS-Transfer Get) specified in the SOAP message be performed against the object whose object reference property (specified as a GUID) is {a492d5f2-18c3-4f93-87d8-09a8c66bb5e4}. In conjunction with the ad:instance SOAP header, this uniquely identifies a single directory object located in a single [**directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds).

The ad:objectReferenceProperty is relative to the [ad:instance header](#Section_2.5.1) specified in the request. If the ad:instance header is not specified, the directory object cannot be uniquely identified, because directory objects on different directory services could share the same GUID or distinguished name.

The ad:instance and ad:objectReferenceProperty header elements are included in the wxf:resourceCreated/wsa:ReferenceParameters element of the response to a WS-Transfer Create operation, as shown in the following example.

In the following descriptions, XPath 1.0 [[XPATH]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90611) notation is used to indicate the XML element or attribute that is being referred to.

A single SOAP fault can specify ad:FaultDetail/ad:Error, ad:FaultDetail/ad:ShortError, or both in addition to exactly one of the following:<6>

- ad:FaultDetail/ad:ArgumentError
- ad:FaultDetail/ad:DirectoryError
- ad:FaultDetail/ad:InvalidAttributeType
- ad:FaultDetail/ad:InvalidOperation
- ad:FaultDetail/ad:InvalidChange
- ad:FaultDetail/ad:InvalidAttributeTypeOrValue
The use of ad:FaultDetail/ad:ArgumentError is implementation-defined.<7>

The presence of ad:FaultDetail/ad:DirectoryError in a SOAP fault indicates that an error was returned by the [**directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds).

| Element | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| ad:FaultDetail/ad:DirectoryError/ad:Message | A human-readable error message string explaining the nature of the directory error that occurred. |
| ad:FaultDetail/ad:DirectoryError/ad:ErrorCode | An [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) resultCode as specified in [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325). |

## 2.7 Range Retrieval

Retrieving the contents of a multivalued attribute from a group such as a distribution list can often result in a large number of returned values. A [**directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds) can place limits on the maximum number of attribute values that can be retrieved in a single query.<10> If an attribute has more values than can be returned by the server in a single call, the only way to enumerate all of the attribute values is through the use of the range option.

Range retrieval involves requesting a limited number of attribute values in a single query. The number of values requested must be less than or equal to the maximum number of values supported by the server. To reduce the number of times the query must contact the server, the number of values requested should be as close to this maximum as possible.

To support range retrieval, the WS-Transfer and WS-Enumeration Web Service protocols in the ADWS protocol set require defining an XML representation to return portions of a multivalued attribute or to specify which portion of the attribute to retrieve. The following sections provide an extension to the XML serialization of the data model defined in section [2.3.2](#Section_2.3.2) that specifies an XML representation of an attribute with only a portion of its values. They also define extensions to the WS-Transfer [[WXFR]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90587) and WS-Enumeration [[WSENUM]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90580) protocols that indicate how a requester is to specify the portion of the attribute values to be returned.

<a id="Section_2.7.1"></a>
### 2.7.1 XML View of Multivalued Attribute with Range Option

Section [2.3.2](#Section_2.3.2) describes the XML view of a [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object) and its attributes as presented by ADWS. This section defines extensions to such an XML view for a multivalued attribute in which only a subset of the values are represented in the XML. This subset is referred to as a range of values. This range of values is represented by XML attributes RangeLow and RangeHigh. For example, suppose that an attribute contains 5,000 values. The XML view might contain only the first 1,000 values, in which case RangeLow and RangeHigh would be 0 and 999, respectively.

The following description defines how a multivalued [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) attribute and a portion of its value(s) limited by a range are represented in the XML view. Let *B* be the LDAP display name of the multivalued attribute that contains the complete set of values *V1(B)*…*Vn(B)*. Let *RANGELOW(B)* and *RANGEHIGH(B)* be the respective lower and higher range of values returned by the server for the multivalued attribute. Let *V*RANGELOW(B) and *V*RANGEHIGH(B) be the returned values lying between *RANGELOW(B)* and *RANGEHIGH(B)* of values *V1(B)* and *Vn(B)*. Let *S*RANGELOW(B)*(B)*…*S*RANGEHIGH(B)*(B)* be the XML representation of values *V*RANGELOW(B)…*V*RANGEHIGH(B) as described in section [2.3.4](#Section_2.3.4). Let *LDAPSYN(B)* be the LDAP [**attribute syntax**](#gt_attribute-syntax) of attribute *B* and let *XMLSYN(B)* be the corresponding XML syntax, as described in section 2.3.4. The XML representation for this multivalued attribute with range option is the following.

<addata:B RangeLow="RANGELOW(B)" RangeHigh="RANGEHIGH(B)" LdapSyntax="LDAPSYN(B)">

<ad:value xsi:type="XMLSYN(B)">

S(RANGELOW(B))(B)

</ad:value>

...

...

<ad:value xsi:type="XMLSYN(B)">

S(RANGEHIGH(B))(B)

</ad:value>

</addata:B>

If *O* is the directory object, *C* being the LDAP display name of the most specific structural object class ([MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 3.1.1.1.4) and *B* being one its multivalued attributes, then the following representation of *O* as the XML view in the data model described in section 2.3.2 remains unchanged except for the multivalued attribute XML representation comprised of range attributes.

<addata:C>

...

...

<addata:B RangeLow="RANGELOW(B)" RangeHigh="RANGEHIGH(B)" LdapSyntax="LDAPSYN(B)">

<ad:value xsi:type="XMLSYN(B)">

S(RANGELOW(B))(B)

</ad:value>

...

...

<ad:value xsi:type="XMLSYN(B)">

S(RANGEHIGH(B))(B)

</ad:value>

</addata:B>

...

...

</addata:C>

For each multivalued LDAP attribute for which the server is including only a portion of the values contained in that attribute, both the RangeLow and RangeHigh XML attributes are returned.

ADWS specification of the possible values of these XML attributes, which are returned in the response as part of the XML view of the object for a request with range specification, is illustrated in section [2.7.2](#Section_1.3).

<a id="Section_2.7.2"></a>
### 2.7.2 Range Specifiers for Requests

The range option for an attribute query is represented using the following XML attributes in the request:

RangeLow="*RANGELOW*" RangeHigh="*RANGEHIGH*"

where *RANGELOW* is the zero-based index of the first attribute value to retrieve, and *RANGEHIGH* is the zero-based index of the last attribute value to retrieve.

When querying for an attribute, a request can specify a RangeLow XML attribute in addition to a RangeHigh XML attribute to retrieve values between the lower and higher range, inclusively. A [**SOAP**](#gt_soap) request to retrieve multivalued attributes containing a RangeHigh XML attribute must also contain a RangeLow XML attribute. A SOAP request to retrieve multivalued attributes not containing a RangeHigh attribute specifies a request to retrieve all the values beyond *RANGELOW* (this is subject to the limit imposed by the server on the maximum number of values that can be returned).

In search queries and results, zero is used for *RANGELOW* to specify the first entry and the wildcard character (*) is used for *RANGEHIGH* to specify all remaining entries. If specified, *RANGELOW* MUST be of type positive integer. If specified, *RANGEHIGH* MUST be either a positive integer or the wildcard character (*).

Both RangeLow and RangeHigh can be absent if the range retrieval extensions as illustrated in [2.7.2.1](#Section_2.7.2.1) and [2.7.2.2](#Section_2.7.2.2) are not used. Both RangeLow and RangeHigh attributes being absent from a request specifies a request for all values to be returned in that single call. For example, if a distribution list contains 1,000 member values, and if this number is less than the directory service-imposed limit on the maximum values that can be retrieved in a single query (1,500 for instance), all 1,000 values must be returned.

If the list of values is larger than the maximum limit of values the server can return, for example 2,000 member values, the first response contains the member attribute with RangeLow and RangeHigh XML attributes specifying the lower and higher range, respectively, and containing all the member values in this range.

To retrieve the next group of member values in the previous example, the search query can be repeated with a range specification that begins at the attribute number that is one past the RANGEHIGH value that was returned in the previous call. This process can be repeated until the last group of values is retrieved. In the above example, the first call would return member values in the range RangeLow as "0" and RangeHigh as "1,499". To retrieve the remaining values, the search query would request member values with RangeLow = 1,500 and RangeHigh = *, and would be given member values in the range RangeLow as "1,500" and RangeHigh as "2000".

The ADWS protocol set shares these range specifiers as common XML attributes that are used to extend WS-Transfer [[WXFR]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90587) Get and WS-Enumeration [[WSENUM]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90580) Enumerate requests, which are described in subsequent sections.

The following table lists examples of how to implement range specifiers.

| Example | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| RangeLow="0" RangeHigh="*" | Retrieve all attribute values.* |
| RangeLow="0" RangeHigh="500" | Retrieve the 1st to 501st values, inclusive. |
| RangeLow="2" RangeHigh="3" | Retrieve the 3rd and 4th values. |
| RangeLow="501" RangeHigh="*" | Retrieve the 502nd and all remaining values.* |

(*) This is subject to the limits imposed by the server.<11>

The following sections illustrate extensions to the WS-Transfer [WXFR] and WS-Enumeration [WSENUM] protocols by specifying how requestors could retrieve only a portion of the attribute values through an Enumerate or Get request using the range specifiers defined previously.

<a id="Section_2.7.2.1"></a>
#### 2.7.2.1 WS-Transfer Range Retrieval Extensions

This section illustrates a range retrieval extension to the Get operation of the WS-Transfer [[WXFR]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90587) protocol, which, when used with [MS-WSTIM](../MS-WSTIM/MS-WSTIM.md) extensions, provides a way to retrieve portions of a multivalued attribute of a specific [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object).

In this example, the following is the XML representation of the da:AttributeType XML element defined in [MS-WSTIM] section 2.2.3.1, with range specifiers for retrieving only portions of the multivalued attribute.

<da:AttributeType RangeLow="0" RangeHigh="*">

addata:member

</da:AttributeType>

The updated XML schema definition for the da:AttributeType element relative to the schema definition defined in [MS-WSTIM] would be similar to the following.

<xsd:element name="AttributeType">

<xsd:complexType>

<xsd:complexContent>

<xsd:extension base="ExtensibleType">

<xsd:attribute name="RangeLow" use="required" type="xsd:nonNegativeInteger"/>

<xsd:attribute name="RangeHigh" use="optional" type="xsd:string"/>

</xsd:sequence>

</xsd:restriction>

</xsd:complexContent>

</xsd:complexType>

<a id="Section_2.7.2.2"></a>
#### 2.7.2.2 WS-Enumeration Range Retrieval Extensions

This section illustrates a range retrieval extension to the Enumerate operation of the WS-Enumerate [[WSENUM]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90580) protocol, which, when used with [MS-WSDS](../MS-WSDS/MS-WSDS.md) extensions, provides a way to retrieve portions of a multivalued attribute of selected [**directory objects**](#gt_directory-object) during a pull operation.

In this example, the following is the XML representation of the ad:SelectionProperty XML element defined in [MS-WSDS] section 3.1.4.1.1.2.1, with range specifiers for retrieving only portions of the multivalued attribute.

<ad:SelectionProperty RangeLow="0" RangeHigh="*">

addata:member

</ad:SelectionProperty>

The updated XML schema definition for the ad:SelectionProperty element relative to the schema defined in [MS-WSDS] would be similar to the following.

<xsd:element name="SelectionProperty">

<xsd:complexType>

<xsd:complexContent>

<xsd:extension base="xsd:string">

<xsd:attribute name="RangeLow" use="required" type="xsd:nonNegativeInteger"/>

<xsd:attribute name="RangeHigh" use="optional" type="xsd:string"/>

</xsd:extension>

</xsd:complexContent>

</xsd:complexType>

</xsd:element>

# 3 Structure Examples

This section contains examples of the XML view of sample [**directory objects**](#gt_directory-object), including the ADWS [**synthetic attributes**](#gt_synthetic-attribute). For illustrative purposes, these examples are shown in the context of protocols in the ADWS protocol set.

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 WS-Transfer 'Get' Example

The following example shows a WS-Transfer Get [[WXFR]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90587) operation. Both the [**SOAP**](#gt_soap) request message and the SOAP response message are shown. This example retrieves the complete XML view of a [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object). In this example, the most specific structural object class of the directory object is user. The object has an [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) [**distinguished name**](#gt_distinguished-name-dn) of "CN=TestUser1,DC=fabrikam,DC=com". The [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) for its [**object reference property**](#gt_object-reference-property) is {1e0f3427-bbcb-474d-a532-a2ba6168c4dc}, and its parent object has a object reference property whose GUID is {e4f8a504-d7df-4b63-a636-5642d3bf1cf6}.

## 3.2 WS-Transfer Identity Management Extension 'ModifyRequest' Example

This example demonstrates a [MS-WSTIM](../MS-WSTIM/MS-WSTIM.md) ModifyRequest operation. Both the [**SOAP**](#gt_soap) request message and the SOAP response message are shown. In the SOAP request message, the requestor is specifying that the [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) directory attribute whose LDAP display name is "description" is to have its value replaced with the new value "Modified description attribute". The requestor is also asking that the values "(212) 555-0100" and "(516) 555-0100" be appended to the set of existing values (if any) in the LDAP directory attribute whose LDAP display name is "otherTelephone". The [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object) on which this operation is being performed is identified by its [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid)-valued [**object reference property**](#gt_object-reference-property) {cf041608-84b9-4fd0-a83c-46d40a964b88}.

## 3.3 WS-Enumeration 'Pull' Example

This example demonstrates a WS-Enumeration Pull operation [[WSENUM]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90580) using a previously obtained enumeration context. Both the [**SOAP**](#gt_soap) request message and the SOAP response message are shown. In the response message, two [**directory objects**](#gt_directory-object) are returned. Both objects have the same parent directory object, as evidenced by the fact that both have the same value for their [ad:container-hierarchy-parent](#Section_2.3.3.2) [**synthetic attribute**](#gt_synthetic-attribute). In this example, the WS-Enumeration Enumerate operation that began the search requested three attributes to be returned: the [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) directory attribute addata:givenName and the synthetic attributes ad:container-hierarchy-parent and [ad:relativeDistinguishedName](#Section_2.3.3.4). The [ad:objectReferenceProperty](#Section_2.3.3.1) synthetic attribute is automatically included in the response by the server [MS-WSDS](../MS-WSDS/MS-WSDS.md).

# 5 Appendix A: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

The terms "earlier" and "later", when used with a product version, refer to either all preceding versions or all subsequent versions, respectively. The term "through" refers to the inclusive range of versions. Applicable Microsoft products are listed chronologically in this section.

- Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system
- Windows Server 2016 operating system
- Windows Server operating system
- Windows Server 2019 operating system
- Windows Server 2022 operating system
- Windows Server 2025 operating system
Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.3: The following products are applicable to Active Directory Web Services: Data Model and Common Elements:

- Active Directory Management Gateway Service contains the server implementation of the ADWS set of protocols that use Active Directory Web Services: Data Model and Common Elements.
- Remote Server Administration Tools (excluding Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows Vista operating system) contains the client implementation. For more information about Remote Server Administration Tools, see [[MSFT-RSAT]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839006).
- Windows Server 2008 R2 and later contain both the server and the client implementations.
Active Directory Management Gateway Service is available for Windows Server 2003 operating system with Service Pack 2 (SP2), Windows Server 2003 R2 operating system with Service Pack 2 (SP2), and Windows Server 2008 operating system.

<2> Section 2.3.3.1: Microsoft implementations of Active Directory Web Services: Data Model and Common Elements do not return the [ad:objectReferenceProperty](#Section_2.3.3.1) [**synthetic attribute**](#gt_synthetic-attribute) if the requestor does not have permission to read *O*!objectGUID, where *O* is the [**directory object**](#gt_directory-object) being represented as an XML view.

<3> Section 2.3.3.2: Microsoft implementations of Active Directory Web Services: Data Model and Common Elements in Active Directory Management Gateway Service for Windows Server 2003 operating system omits this attribute from the XML view of all directory objects, regardless of whether the directory object has a parent.

<4> Section 2.3.4: Microsoft implementations of Active Directory Web Services: Data Model and Common Elements use the following mapping between **rootDse** attributes (specified by their [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) display names) and XML syntaxes.

<5> Section 2.5.1: Microsoft implementations of Active Directory Web Services: Data Model and Common Elements provide access to any [**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**](#gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds) or [**Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)**](#gt_active-directory-lightweight-directory-services-ad-lds) [**directory service**](#gt_directory-service-ds) that is running on the same computer as ADWS. AD DS can be accessed via "ldap:389". If the machine is also an AD DS [**global catalog**](#gt_global-catalog-gc), then the global catalog can be accessed as "ldap:3268". An AD LDS instance can be accessed as "ldap:N", where N is the LDAP port number that the AD LDS instance has been configured to use.

<6> Section 2.6: Microsoft implementations of Active Directory Web Services: Data Model and Common Elements include both ad:FaultDetail/ad:Error and ad:FaultDetail/ad:ShortError elements.

<7> Section 2.6: Microsoft implementations of Active Directory Web Services: Data Model and Common Elements use ad:FaultDetail/ad:ArgumentError to indicate that an invalid argument was passed from one internal function to another.

| Element | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| ad:FaultDetail/ad:ArgumentError/ad:Message | A human-readable error message string explaining the nature of the argument error that occurred. |
| ad:FaultDetail/ad:ArgumentError/ad:ParameterName | The name of the function parameter whose argument was invalid. |

<8> Section 2.6: Microsoft implementations of Active Directory Web Services: Data Model and Common Elements translate LDAP error codes to Win32 error codes ([MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.2) using the following table.

| LDAP Error | Win32 Error | Column 3 | Column 4 |
