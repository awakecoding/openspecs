# 1 Introduction

Virtualizing storage allows for high availability and more efficient use of physical storage space. Virtual files can be hosted either locally or remotely for multiple access. An implementer can also leverage network adapters that have Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) capability to provide faster throughput and lower latency and CPU utilization. This document provides an overview of the protocols that support virtual storage and provides examples of their use.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_application"></a>
**application**: A participant that is responsible for beginning, propagating, and completing an atomic transaction. An application communicates with a transaction manager in order to begin and complete transactions. An application communicates with a transaction manager in order to marshal transactions to and from other applications. An application also communicates in application-specific ways with a resource manager in order to submit requests for work on resources.

<a id="gt_authentication-service-as"></a>
**Authentication Service (AS)**: A service that issues ticket granting tickets (TGTs), which are used for authenticating principals within the realm or domain served by the [**Authentication Service**](#gt_authentication-service).

<a id="gt_file-client"></a>
**file client**: An application that implements client-side file access protocol components and enables the primary actor, the user, to access the shared files on a remote file server.

<a id="gt_file-server"></a>
**file server**: The service or process on a server computer that implements the server-side file access protocol components to enable remote file sharing for the file clients.

<a id="gt_high-availability-share"></a>
**high-availability share**: A share that supports continuous availability of data by storing copies of that data on multiple hosts.

<a id="gt_open"></a>
**open**: A runtime object that corresponds to a currently established access to a specific file or a named pipe from a specific client to a specific server, using a specific user security context. Both clients and servers maintain opens that represent active accesses.

<a id="gt_small-computer-system-interface-scsi"></a>
**small computer system interface (SCSI)**: A set of standards for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices.

<a id="gt_user"></a>
**user**: The real person who has a member account. The user is authenticated by being asked to prove knowledge of the secret password associated with the user name.

<a id="gt_virtual-disk"></a>
**virtual disk**: A disk that does not have a physical mechanical counterpart to it, and is not exposed as a hardware array LUN. It is a disk that uses a file to store its data. When this file is exposed to the operating system as a disk device, the exposed disk device emulates and, for all intents and purposes, behaves like a physical disk.

<a id="gt_virtual-disk-file"></a>
**virtual disk file**: The file that is the backing store for a [**virtual disk**](#gt_virtual-disk). This file may be exposed to an operating system as a disk device. The exposed disk device is referred to as a [**virtual disk**](#gt_virtual-disk).

## 1.3 Overview

This document provides an overview of the functionality of and relationship among the Virtual Storage protocols, which provide a means for a client to access, read, and write to virtual storage (for example, a [**virtual disk file**](#gt_virtual-disk-file)) on a remote server. Virtual Storage protocols can also provide this functionality to multiple clients by using a shared virtual [**SCSI**](#gt_small-computer-system-interface-scsi) disk.

This document describes the intended functionality of the Virtual Storage protocols and how those protocols interact with each other. It provides examples of some common use cases. It does not restate the processing rules and other details that are specific for each protocol. Those details are described in the specifications for the protocols and data structures that belong to this group.

The file client attempts to establish a tree connection to the file server, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.4.2.4, using an SMB2 TREE_CONNECT Request ([MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 2.2.9).
- The file server processes the SMB2 TREE_CONNECT Request, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.3.5.7. The file server responds with an SMB2 TREE_CONNECT Response, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 2.2.10.
- The file client processes the SMB2 TREE_CONNECT Response, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.5.5, and returns STATUS_SUCCESS to the RSVD client.
- Upon success, the RSVD client requests opening the shared virtual SCSI disk by sending the file name of the shared virtual SCSI disk, and an SVHDX_OPEN_DEVICE_CONTEXT structure ([MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 2.2.4.12), and requests that the **CreateOptions** field of the SMB2 CREATE Request be set to FILE_NO_INTERMEDIATE_BUFFERING. The values for the SVHDX_OPEN_DEVICE_CONTEXT structure are described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.1.4.2.
- The file client processes the request, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.4.3. The file client constructs an SMB2 CREATE Request that contains an SMB2_CREATE_CONTEXT Request ([MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 2.2.13.2). The **Buffer** field of the SMB2_CREATE_CONTEXT will contain the SVHDX_OPEN_DEVICE_CONTEXT structure that was passed in from the RSVD client ([MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 2.2.13.2.14).
- The file server processes the SMB2 CREATE Request, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) sections 3.3.5.9 and 3.3.5.9.14. If successful, the file server passes the SVHDX_OPEN_DEVICE_CONTEXT structure that is contained in the SMB2_CREATE_CONTEXT Request to the RSVD server.

### 3.2.2 Interacting with a Shared Virtual SCSI Disk

**Goal**

This use case supports sending and receiving SCSI commands to a shared virtual SCSI disk.

**Context of use**

The user interacts with the application, causing information about the shared virtual SCSI disk to be accessed for the contents contained in the shared virtual SCSI disk. Other events can also cause the application to send SCSI commands to the shared virtual SCSI disk.

**Actors**

**Application**: The application is the primary actor that triggers this use case.

**RSVD Client**: The RSVD client is a supporting actor that both implements the client role and consumes the services that are offered by the RSVD server.

**RSVD Server**: The RSVD server is a supporting actor that implements the server role and services the requests made by the RSVD client.

**File Client**: The file client is a supporting actor that implements client-side protocol components and consumes the file services that are offered by the file server.

**File Server**: The file server is a supporting actor and implements server-side protocol components and the file services that are consumed by the file client.

**Preconditions**

The application has a valid file handle to the shared virtual SCSI disk, as described in section [3.2.1](#Section_3.2.1).

**Main success scenario**

- Trigger: Based on user interaction or an event, the application sends a SCSI command to the shared virtual SCSI disk.
- Before sending the first SCSI command, the application queries the shared virtual SCSI disk for information about itself. The application can retrieve this information as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.1.4.6.
- The RSVD server processes the request, as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.2.5.5.1.
- The application sends a SCSI command to the shared virtual SCSI disk, as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.1.4.9.
- The RSVD server processes the SCSI command, as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.2.5.5.5, and sends the response from the shared virtual SCSI disk back to the RSVD client.
- The RSVD client passes any error or success data back to the application.
**Postcondition**

The application has received the data it requested from the shared virtual SCSI disk.

**Variations**

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.2.1"></a>
#### 3.2.2.1 Success Case Example

The following diagram shows the steps required for the application to send SCSI commands to the shared virtual SCSI disk. The application has to first retrieve the information about the shared virtual SCSI disk before SCSI commands can be sent.

![Interacting with a shared virtual SCSI disk](media/image9.png)

Figure 9: Interacting with a shared virtual SCSI disk

The application is required to have a handle to the shared virtual SCSI disk, as described in section [3.2.1](#Section_3.2.1).

- Before the first SCSI command can be sent, the application has to retrieve the shared virtual SCSI disk’s information. The application calls the RSVD client, providing the handle to the shared virtual SCSI disk that was received in section [3.2.1](#Section_3.2.1) and providing the maximum buffer size the application will accept, as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.1.4.6. The RSVD client constructs an SVHDX_TUNNEL_OPERATION_HEADER structure, as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.1.4.6. The RSVD client then calls the file client, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.4.20.11, providing the handle, the control code of FSCTL_SVHDX_SYNC_TUNNEL_REQUEST, the SVHDX_TUNNEL_OPERATION_HEADER structure ([MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 2.2.4.11), and the buffer size.
- The file client processes the request and sends an SMB2 IOCTL Request ([MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 2.2.31) to the file server, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.3.5.15.15, with the SVHDX_TUNNEL_OPERATION_HEADER structure in the **Buffer** field and the **MaxOutputResponse** field set to the response buffer size.
- The file server processes the SMB2 IOCTL Request and passes the SVHDX_TUNNEL_OPERATION_HEADER structure, the handle, and the value from the **MaxOutputResponse** field to the RSVD server, as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.2.4.
- The RSVD server processes the request, as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) sections 3.2.5.5 and 3.2.5.5.1. The RSVD server returns an SVHDX_TUNNEL_OPERATION_HEADER structure and an SVHDX_TUNNEL_INITIAL_INFO_RESPONSE structure to the file server containing the response.
- The file server creates an SMB2 IOCTL Response, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 2.2.32, with the SVHDX_TUNNEL_OPERATION_HEADER and SVHDX_TUNNEL_INITIAL_INFO_RESPONSE structures in the **Buffer** field. The SMB2 IOCTL Response is sent to the file client.
- The file client processes the SMB2 IOCTL Response as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.5.14.13. The file client sends the response data to the RSVD client as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.1.5.5.
- The RSVD client processes the response and sends the status and the shared virtual SCSI disk’s information to the application. With the virtual SCSI disk’s information, the application can now send SCSI commands to the shared virtual SCSI disk.
The application calls the RSVD client as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.1.4.9.

- The RSVD client constructs an SVHDX_TUNNEL_OPERATION_HEADER and SVHDX_TUNNEL_SCSI_REQUEST structure. The RSVD client is only a transport for the SCSI commands and doesn’t perform any processing on the application-provided values for the **CDBLength**, **SenseInfoExLength**, **DataIn**, **SrbFlags**, and **CDBBuffer** fields of the SVHDX_TUNNEL_SCSI_REQUEST structure. If the optional fields are not provided by the application, the **DataTransferLength** field is set to zero and the **DataBuffer** field is set to empty. The RSVD client then calls the interface on the file client, described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.4.20.11, and provides the handle and the SVHDX_TUNNEL_OPERATION_HEADER and SVHDX_TUNNEL_SCSI_REQUEST structures.
- The file client processes the request, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.4.20.11, and sends and SMB2 IOCTL Request to the file server. The **Buffer** field of the SMB2 IOCTL Request has to contain the SVHDX_TUNNEL_OPERATION_HEADER and SVHDX_TUNNEL_SCSI_REQUEST structures.
- The file server processes the request as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.3.5.15.15. The file server passes the SVHDX_TUNNEL_OPERATION_HEADER and SVHDX_TUNNEL_SCSI_REQUEST structures to the RSVD server as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.2.4.
- The RSVD server processes the request as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) sections 3.2.5.5 and 3.2.5.5.5. The RSVD server issues the CDB command contained in the SVHDX_TUNNEL_SCSI_REQUEST structure to the shared virtual SCSI disk. The RSVD server constructs an SVHDX_TUNNEL_OPERATION_HEADER and SVHDX_TUNNEL_SCSI_RESPONSE structure that contains the response to the CDB command from the shared virtual SCSI disk.
- The file server creates an SMB2 IOCTL Response, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 2.2.32, with the SVHDX_TUNNEL_OPERATION_HEADER and SVHDX_TUNNEL_SCSI_RESPONSE structures in the **Buffer** field. The SMB2 IOCTL Response is then sent to the file client.
- The file client processes the SMB2 IOCTL Response as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.5.14.13. The file client sends the response data to the RSVD client as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.1.5.8.
- The RSVD client processes the response and sends the status and the results of the CDB command to the application.

### 3.2.3 Disconnecting from a Shared Virtual SCSI Disk

**Goal**

To close the connection to the shared virtual SCSI disk.

**Context of use**

The user no longer needs access to the contents of the shared virtual SCSI disk.

**Actors**

**Application**: The application is the primary actor that triggers this use case.

**RSVD Client**: The RSVD client is a supporting actor that both implements the client role and consumes the services that are offered by the RSVD server.

**RSVD Server**: The RSVD server is a supporting actor that implements the server role and services the requests made by the RSVD client.

**File Client**: The file client is a supporting actor that implements client-side protocol components and consumes the file services that are offered by the file server.

**File Server**: The file server is a supporting actor and implements server-side protocol components and the file services that are consumed by the file client.

**Preconditions**

The application has a file handle identifying the shared virtual SCSI disk.

**Main success scenario**

- Trigger: The application receives input from the user indicating that the connection to the shared virtual SCSI disk can be closed.
- The application uses the interface described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.1.4.3 to close the open on the shared virtual SCSI disk using the file client.
- The file client closes the open as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.4.5.
- The file server processes the close, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.3.4.17, and causes the RSVD server to close the open as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.2.5.2.
- Optionally, the file client can disconnect from the share.
**Postcondition**

The open to the shared virtual SCSI disk is now closed.

**Variations**

After the file handle is closed, the file client can optionally log off from the share.

#### 3.2.3.1 Success Case Example

The following diagram shows the steps required to close the connection to the shared virtual SCSI disk. Optionally, the file client can log off from the share.

![Disconnecting from a shared virtual SCSI disk](media/image10.png)

Figure 10: Disconnecting from a shared virtual SCSI disk

The application is required to have a handle to the shared virtual SCSI disk as described in section 3.2.1.

- The application requests that the RSVD client close its connection to the shared virtual SCSI disk as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.1.4.3. The RSVD client requests that the file client process the close as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.4.5.
- The file client sends an SMB2 CLOSE Request to the file server. The file server passes the close request to the RSVD server as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.2.5.2.
- The RSVD server processes the close request.
- The RSVD server requests that the file server send an SMB2 CLOSE Response, containing the status code returned from the close operation, to the file client.
- The file client processes the SMB2 CLOSE Response, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.5.9, and passes the status code to the RSVD client.
- The RSVD client returns the response to the application as described in [MS-RSVD](../MS-RSVD/MS-RSVD.md) section 3.1.5.2.
Optionally, the file client can disconnect from the file server.

- The file client processes the disconnect request as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.4.22. The file client sends an SMB2 TREE_DISCONNECT Request ([MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 2.2.11) to the file server.
- The file server processes the SMB2 TREE_DISCONNECT Request as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.3.5.8. The file server then sends an SMB2 TREE_DISCONNECT Response ([MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 2.2.12) to the file client.
- The file client processes the SMB2 TREE_DISCONNECT Response as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.5.6. The file client then terminates the connection to the file server, as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.4.23, by sending an SMB2 LOGOFF Request.
- The file server processes the SMB2 LOGOFF Request as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.3.5.6. The file server then sends an SMB2 LOGOFF Response to the file client.
- Finally, the file client processes the SMB2 LOGOFF Response as described in [MS-SMB2](../MS-SMB2/MS-SMB2.md) section 3.2.5.4.
