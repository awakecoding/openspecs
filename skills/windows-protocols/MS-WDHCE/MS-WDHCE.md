## 1.3 Overview

The Miracast v1.1 protocol [[WF-DTS1.1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=509809) only supports a single stream from the source to the sink, this means that the mouse image has to be part of the desktop image that is encoded and streamed to the sink. This binds the mouse cursor refresh rate and latency to that of the desktop image. Currently the Miracast stream is typically 30 Hz with a screen to screen latency of around 200ms. As a reference point the screen to screen latency over HDMI wire is around 32ms. We know from usability studies that mouse cursor latency is more noticeable to the user than the rest of the desktop. So it would be desirable to decouple the mouse cursor from the rest of the desktop image.

It is possible to send the mouse cursor information in a separate stream to the sink so the update rate of the cursor can be de-coupled from the update rate of the desktop image. This would require the graphics driver to send the information and the Miracast receiver to be able to receive 2 streams and then blend the cursor image with the desktop image.

This document describes the hardware capabilities that a sink would need in order to process and display the cursor information and additional detail the protocol changes required to send this additional stream to the sink.

This document assumes that the mouse cursor and position information is sent by the source and received by the sink. Any bitmap/cursor shape information has been successfully transmitted in a lossless manner.

For the Miracast scenario, the cursor image size would typically be smaller than 48x48, even in high DPI scenarios the cursor image is expected to be less than 64x64. Ultimately the application is in control of the cursor shape (max 256x256) so the solution has to work with arbitrary cursors.

In an artificial scenario where the user is moving an animated cursor constantly, we observed a max of 100 mouse positions updates per second and 20 mouse cursor shape changes per second.

In some configurations, it is possible that a device might not support the Microsoft Hardware Cursor extension but might support the previous standard of Intel Fast Cursor. Applicable information for Intel Fast Cursor is described in the appropriate sections for devices that support both extensions.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This document describes an extension to the existing Miracast v1.1 standard for Wireless Display over WiFi Direct [[WF-DTS1.1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=509809). The protocol communicates over RTP/RTSP as described in the Miracast standard and this extension adds an additional capability query and support for side channel UDP communication between a source and receiver device during a Miracast session.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

This extension is to be implemented by a device (either source or receiver) that implements the Miracast v1.1 protocol [[WF-DTS1.1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=509809). This extension is only available when used in conjunction with other devices that support this extension, otherwise the functionality will be ignored.

A source that implements this extension sends mouse cursor information to the sink in a similar format to an OS passing cursor information to a local display driver. Some sinks cannot support the XOR operation used by monochrome and color mask cursors, and in order to allow hardware cursor functionality on those sinks, the sink capabilities include a flag noting whether the sink supports the XOR operation. If the sink does not support XOR, the source converts any XOR masks into non-XOR masks. If a sink supports this extension, then it must support the alpha color cursor image type.

With the alpha cursor color image, a 32 bits per pixel ARGB image is supplied, with the 8 bit alpha value used to blend between the RGB values in the display image and the RGB values in the cursor image. The result of the blending operation is sent to the display.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The goal for this extension is to improve the end-to-end latency of the mouse cursor when streaming over Miracast. This is a valuable improvement to the baseline Miracast protocol particularly in scenarios such as productivity or gaming where low-latency responsive user input with a mouse is a high priority. If both devices participating in a Miracast session support this extension, it is recommended for use 100% of the time.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

**Supported Transports:** This protocol is be implemented on top of TCP/UDP as specified in the Miracast v1.1 specification [[WF-DTS1.1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=509809).

**Capability Negotiation:** This extension performs explicit capability negation in the M3 capabilities message as defined in the Miracast protocol.

A new optional RTSP parameter 'microsoft_cursor' is used to query for hardware cursor support and capabilities. The following is the ABNF format for the response from the sink to the microsoft_cursor using the GET_PARAMETER command as specified in [WF-DTS1.1] section 6.2.2.

microsoft-cursor = "none" / sink-cursor-caps ; "none" means the sink does not support this hardware cursor extension ; otherwise it is assumed that the sink can support per pixel 8bit ; alpha blending of hardware cursor.

sink-cursor-caps = xor-support SP x-max SP y-max SP port

xor-support = "none" / "full" ; "none" means the sink does not support XOR blending operations at ; all, "full" indicates the sink can perform the XOR blending ; operations.

x-max = 4HEXDIG ; the maximum width of the cursor the sink supports in pixels, the sink ; supports this width for all cursor formats.

y-max = 4HEXDIG ; the maximum height of the cursor the sink supports in pixels, the ; sink supports this height for all cursor formats.

port = 4HEXDIG ; this is the UDP port to which the source sends the mouse cursor ; position and shape changes.

In the case that a device supports Intel Fast Cursor as well, the following information also applies. A new optional RTSP parameter 'intel_fast_cursor' is used to query for Intel Fast Cursor support and capabilities. The following is the ABNF format for the response from the sink to the intel_fast_cursor using the GET_PARAMTETER command, as specified in [WF-DTS1.1] section 6.2.2.

intel-fast-cursor = "intel_fast_cursor:" SP "port=" fast-cursor-port

fast-cursor-port = IPPORT

Fast cursor ports are a value from the port range (49152 to 65535) with the exception of older Intel WiDi devices that can only support fast cursor messages on port 1232.

Note that a sink that supports the Intel Fast Cursor extension ignores a fast cursor message if: (1) it does not conform to the ABNF rules; (2) the x parameter is equal to or greater than the width parameter; (3) the y parameter is equal to or greater than the height parameter; or (4) the sink has transmitted a UIBC packet within the previous 100ms. If a sink receives a fast cursor message containing the current-position ABNF rule, the sink displays a locally rendered cursor at the indicated location. If a sink receives a fast cursor message containing the hidden ABNF rule (see section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2)), the sink does not display any locally rendered cursors. If it has been more than 100ms since a fast cursor message was received, a sink does not display any locally rendered cursors.

## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol uses HRESULT values as defined in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.1. Vendors can define their own HRESULT values, provided they set the C bit (0x20000000) for each vendor-defined value, indicating the value is a customer code.

## 1.9 Standards Assignments

## 2.1 Transport

As defined by the Miracast v1.1 protocol [[WF-DTS1.1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=509809), this extension uses RTSP, which uses TCP at the transport layer to maintain an end-to-end connection. The capability negotiation portion of this extension occurs over RTSP.

A new RTSP parameter is defined that is part of M3 capabilities request that will query for the sink’s support of hardware cursor and capabilities. If supported, the source will send mouse pointer position and shape updates to the sink over UDP, and the sink MUST decide which UDP port to use.

There will not be any acknowledgment scheme to ensure delivery of the mouse point position or shape changes, but because mouse pointer image packets are bigger and missing one greatly affects the user experience, the source sends the update multiple times to ensure the sink receives the update.

The source will expand all monochrome cursors into masked color cursors before sending to the sink.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

Both the mouse position and shape packets use an RTP header as follows.

| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable | **0** | Version P X CC M PT Sequence Number |
| Variable | **32** | Timestamp - - - - - - |
| Variable | **64** | SSRC identifier - - - - - - |

We define a new ‘Microsoft cursor’ application profile. For this protocol extension, the following values are used in the RTP header.

| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable | **Version (2 bits)** | 2 |
| **P (1 bit)** | 0 (No padding) | - |
| **X (1 bit)** | 0 (No extension) | - |
| Variable | **CC (4 bits)** | 0 (No CSRC) |
| **M (1 bit)** | 0 (No marker used) | - |
| Variable | **PT (7 bits)** | 0 (Mouse position/shape update payload for this profile) |
| Variable | **Sequence Number (16 bits)** | Incrementing sequence number starting at zero |
| Variable | **Timestamp (32 bits)** | 0 (Not used) |
| Variable | **SSRC identifier (32 bits)** | 0 (Not used) |

All network data is transmitted in network byte order.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Namespaces

None.

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 Mouse pointer position message

When the graphics driver is informed of a mouse position change, it sends a message to the sink so that the sink can update the screen location of the mouse pointer on the wireless display. The UDP messages have an RTP header (as specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2)) followed by a binary message in the following format.

| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8 bit unsigned | MsgType | The type of cursor message, valid values 0x01 Mouse cursor position update 0x02 Mouse cursor shape update 0x03 Mouse cursor shape continuation For mouse cursor position update this will be 0x01 |
| 16 bit unsigned | PacketMsgSize | The total size of this message in bytes, for mouse pointer update this is 0x0007 |
| 16 bit signed | XPos | The X position of the upper-left corner of the pointer position relative to this Miracast display, see notes below. |
| 16 bit signed | YPos | The Y position of the upper-left corner of the pointer position relative to this Miracast display, see notes below |

The mouse position update packet MUST always be in its own UDP packet and hence will always be located directly after the RTP header.

If Intel Fast Cursor is supported<1> the following variation of the mouse pointer position message will be used. One 32-bit fast cursor message will be sent for each UDP packet, formatted as follows.

fast-cursor-message = "fast-cursor=" hidden / current-position hidden = "0:0:0:0:0" current-position = width ":" height ":" x ":" y ":" orientation width = 1*4DIGIT ; total pixel width of the host screen (e.g. 1920) height = 1*4DIGIT ; total pixel height of the host screen (e.g., 1080) x = 1*4DIGIT ; x coordinate of the cursor position [0..width-1] y = 1*4DIGIT ; y coordinate of the cursor [0..height-1] orientation = "0" / "90" / "180" / "270" ; degrees of display rotation

<a id="Section_2.2.3"></a>
### 2.2.3 Mouse pointer shape message

When the graphics driver is given a new mouse pointer shape, it sends one or more messages to the sink. Each message is a UDP packet beginning with an RTP header, as specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2). If the pointer image data fits in a single UDP packet, only one message is sent. If the image data is too large for a single UDP packet, the first packet is followed by packets containing the remaining image data.

The first packet consists of an RTP header followed by the fields in the following table, in this order:

| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8 bit unsigned | MsgType | The type of cursor message. This will be 0x02 to indicate that it is the start of the mouse cursor shape update messages. |
| 16 bit unsigned | PacketMsgSize | The total size of this message (not including the RTP header) in bytes. For mouse pointer shape update messages, this includes the fields in this table and any image data contained within the packet. This excludes any data contained in continuation packets. |
| 32 bit unsigned | TotalImageDataSize | The total size of the image data for this cursor. This includes image data in this packet plus any image data in subsequent packets. Recall that the image data for a single cursor can be split across multiple packets. |
| 16 bit unsigned | CursorImageId | The ID of the cursor images; this will be used to distinguish between new shapes and re-transmission of current shape |
| 16 bit signed | XPos | The X position of the upper-left corner of the pointer position relative to this Miracast display; see notes below. |
| 16 bit signed | YPos | The Y position of the upper-left corner of the pointer position relative to this Miracast display; see notes below |
| 8 bit unsigned | CursorImageType | The type of cursor image being sent; valid values are: 0x01 Disabled 0x02 Masked color image, PNG compressed 0x03 Color cursor image, PNG compressed |
| 16 bit unsigned | HotSpotXPos | The X-axis offset of the hot spot offset from the upper-left corner of the cursor image. |
| 16 bit unsigned | HotSpotYPos | The Y-axis offset of the hot spot offset from the upper-left corner of the cursor image. |
| 8 bit unsigned array | ImageData | The portion of the total cursor image data that is contained within this packet. The size of the image data in this packet is PacketMsgSize-18. If PacketMsgSize-18 is equal to TotalImageDataSize, the complete cursor image is contained within this single packet and no continuation packet is needed for this cursor image update. |

If the image data does not fit into a single packet, one or more mouse cursor shape continuation packets are sent to communicate the remaining image data. Each continuation packet begins with an RTP header and is followed by the fields in the following table, in this order:

| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8 bit unsigned | MsgType | The type of cursor message. For mouse cursor shape continuation messages, this will be 0x03. |
| 16 bit unsigned | PacketMsgSize | The total size of this message (not including the RTP header) in bytes. For mouse pointer shape continuation messages, this includes the fields in this table and any image data contained within the packet. This excludes any data contained in any subsequent continuation packets. |
| 32 bit unsigned | TotalImageDataSize | The total size of the image data for this cursor. This includes image data in this packet plus any image data in preceding and subsequent packets. Recall that the image data for a single cursor can be split across multiple packets. |
| 16 bit unsigned | CursorImageId | The ID of this cursor images; this will be used to distinguish between new shapes and re-transmission of current shape. |
| 32 bit signed | PacketPayloadOffset | The offset into the entire mouse shape data buffer (of compressed PNG data) where the ImageData in this packet should go. This allows the sink process the packets out of order as this gives them the information needed to copy this packets part of the mouse image into the correct location in the buffer. |
| 8 bit unsigned array | ImageData | The portion of the total cursor image data that is contained within this packet, the size of image data in this packet is PacketMsgSize-13. |

The mouse pointer shape messages also contain the current mouse pointer position. Just like the mouse cursor position, it is updated only once per frame during the vertical blank period. The latest image replaces any previous image.

## 3.1 Source Details

**Source sending mouse pointer position updates:**

The source MUST send pointer position update messages as defined in section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2).

This mouse cursor position update message gives the new location of the upper-left side of the mouse cursor image. This is not affected by the location of the pointer's hot spot within the cursor image. If the sink needs to know the position of the hot spot (for example with UIBC), then it MUST add the hot spot offset that was sent in the last mouse cursor image update.

**Note** The X and Y position can be negative and the sink MUST perform any clipping that is necessary to ensure that only the visible part of the mouse cursor is displayed.

Because the UDP packets can be delivered out of order, the sink needs to maintain the RTP sequence number of the last mouse position update (either mouse position or shape packet) and store the new mouse position (or shape packet) if the RTP sequence number is higher (accounting for RTP sequence number wrap).

**Source sending mouse pointer shape updates**

The source MUST send mouse pointer shape update messages as defined in section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3).

**Note** If the image type is disabled, the sink stops displaying a hardware cursor from the start of the next frame.

The sink maintains the CursorImageId of the last shape update it received so when it receives a new mouse pointer shape packet, it can discard the packet if the CursorImageId is not greater than the previous shape update. In the case where the CursorImageId is the same, the XPos and the YPos can still be used to update the current pointer position (if RTP sequence number of shape update is greater than that of the last position update).

Because we do not use an acknowledgement mechanism, the source needs to transmit the cursor image multiple times to the sink to ensure that the sink displays the correct image. The source sends the same cursor image up to 4 times at 100ms intervals (1 transmission, then 3 retransmissions), this resent schedule is reset every time the mouse image is updated.

**Testing Note:** Even with a 64Kb UDP packet, it is still possible for the compressed image to span multiple packets, so the source and sink MUST both test with mouse shape updates that span multiple UDP packets. It is recommended to test with a 256x256 cursor image that compresses to more than 64Kb in size to verify this behavior. For source implementations, it is recommended to compile the graphics driver to use a very small UDP packet size to test this behavior.

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

**Mouse pointer position:** The position of the mouse cursor on the source device's screen.

**Mouse pointer shape:** The image used to visually represent the mouse pointer, which can change shape contextually when the user performs actions like clicking links or resizing windows.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

Initialization of this extension occurs during the capabilities query defined by the Miracast standard. A new optional RTSP parameter ‘microsoft_cursor’ is used to query for hardware cursor support and capabilities.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

When a user causes a mouse cursor shape change, the source’s graphics driver is informed, and MUST send a message to the sink communicating this shape change, as described in section [3.1.1](#Section_3.1.1).

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

## 3.2 Sink Details

The mouse pointer position and shape on the display should be update once per frame during the vertical blank period to avoid any tearing of the mouse image.

<a id="Section_3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

**Mouse pointer position:** The position of the mouse cursor on the source device's screen.

**Mouse pointer shape:** The image used to visually represent the mouse pointer, which can change shape contextually when the user performs actions like clicking links or resizing windows.

<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

Initialization of this extension occurs during the capabilities query defined by the Miracast standard. A new optional RTSP parameter ‘microsoft_cursor’ is used to query for hardware cursor support and capabilities.

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

It is unnecessary for the sink to display the mouse pointer for every individual shape or position message received—just the most recent one. For example, if during one frame the sink receives 10 position updates and 5 shape changes, then the mouse pointer position and shape for the next frame should be the most recent position and shape that the sink received.

For example:

| Event | Frame number being scanned out to TV/monitor | Mouse position displayed on screen | Mouse shape displayed on screen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VSync of TV/monitor | 0 | Pos1 | Shape1 |
| VSync of TV/monitor | 1 | Pos1 | Shape1 |
| Receive new mouse position Pos2 | 1 | Pos1 | Shape1 |
| Receive new mouse position Pos3 | 1 | Pos1 | Shape1 |
| Receive new mouse shape Shape2 Pos 4 | 1 | Pos1 | Shape1 |
| VSync of TV/monitor | 2 | Pos4 | Shape2 |
| Receive new mouse position Pos5 | 2 | Pos4 | Shape2 |
| Receive new mouse shape Shape3 Pos 6 | 2 | Pos4 | Shape2 |
| Receive new mouse position Pos7 | 2 | Pos4 | Shape2 |
| Receive new mouse shape Shape4 Pos 8 | 2 | Pos4 | Shape2 |
| Receive new mouse position Pos9 | 2 | Pos4 | Shape2 |
| Receive new mouse position Pos10 | 2 | Pos4 | Shape2 |
| VSync of TV/monitor | 3 | Pos10 | Shape4 |

<a id="Section_3.2.6"></a>
### 3.2.6 Timer Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.7"></a>
### 3.2.7 Other Local Events

Sources can support multiple cursor types, though the source MUST convert the cursor image and PNG compress it before sending it to the sink. The table below illustrates how the source converts the different types of cursors into cursor images to send to the sink. As can be seen below, a sink that supports the XOR operation only receives masked color and color cursor shapes, but in the case where a sink does not support the XOR operation, it is sent as a color cursor with 8bpp alpha.

| Source cursor type | Sink that supports XOR | Sink that does not support XOR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monochrome without XOR pixels | Masked color without XOR | Color cursor with 8bpp alpha |
| Monochrome with XOR pixels | Masked color with XOR | Color cursor with 8bpp alpha |
| Masked color without XOR pixels | Masked color without XOR | Color cursor with 8bpp alpha |
| Masked color with XOR pixels | Masked color with XOR | Color cursor with 8bpp alpha |
| Color cursor with 8bpp alpha | Color cursor with 8bpp alpha | Color cursor with 8bpp alpha |

<a id="Section_4"></a>
# 4 Protocol Examples

On initial connection, a source that has implemented the hardware cursor extension queries the capabilities of the sink through the M3 message defined in the Miracast protocol [[WF-DTS1.1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=509809). The sink responds with acknowledgement of capabilities and supported extensions.

If the sink reports that it does support the hardware cursor extension, the source sends cursor position and shape updates as specified by the extension. The following is an example response message from a sink that supports the hardware cursor extension.

| M3 message | Sink response |
| --- | --- |
| microsoft_cursor | full 0x0200 0x0200 50001 |

The previous example indicates that this sink supports XOR cursor types (full), supports cursor shapes up to 512x512 pixels, and has chosen to communicate over port 50001.

If the sink does not explicitly report that it supports the hardware cursor extension, the source encodes the cursor image into the desktop image. Such a source would simply report no support in the following response.

| M3 message | Sink response |
| --- | --- |
| microsoft_cursor | none |

When a sink reports support of the hardware cursor extension, it will then receive cursor messages from the source for the duration of the Miracast session each time the cursor position or shape changes on the source. The sink will receive multiple mouse cursor message types.

The example below demonstrates a sample mouse cursor position update; when receiving a cursor position update the sink then updates its internal cursor position. The example message below indicates that the cursor position has been updated, and is located at the x, y coordinate (13,10).

| Message parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| MsgType | 0x1 |
| PacketMsgSize | 0x7 |
| Xpos | 12 |
| Ypos | 10 |

The example below demonstrates a sample mouse shape update message; when receiving a cursor shape update, the sink updates the cursor image displayed. The example below demonstrates the more complex example in which the shape change message is large enough that a shape change continuation message is required as well.

**Initial shape change message**

| Message parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| MsgType | 0x2 |
| PacketMsgSize | 0x112 |
| TotalImageDataSize | 0x200 |
| CursorImageID | 0x1234 |
| Xpos | 12 |
| Ypos | 10 |
| CursorImageType | 0x3 |
| HotSpotXPos | 18 |
| HotSpotYPos | 15 |
| ImageData | First 0x100 bytes of PNG cursor |

**Shape continuation message**

| Message parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| MsgType | 0x3 |
| PacketMsgSize | 0x10D |
| TotalImageDataSize | 0x200 |
| CursorImageID | 0x1234 |
| PacketPayloadOffset | 0x100 |
| ImageData | Next 0x100 bytes of PNG cursor |

For smaller shape change message, the continuation message is not necessary but this example has shown a larger message for completeness.

**Intel Fast Cursor Message**

Examples of valid fast cursor messages and the corresponding cursor position when in a 1920x1080 resolution are:

| Message | Description |
| --- | --- |
| fast_cursor=1920:1080:0:0:0 | Cursor at upper-left corner |
| fast_cursor=1920:1080:1919:1079:0 | Cursor at lower-right corner |
| fast_cursor=1366:768:682:383:0 | Cursor at center of the screen |
| fast_cursor=0:0:0:0:0 | Cursor is hidden |
