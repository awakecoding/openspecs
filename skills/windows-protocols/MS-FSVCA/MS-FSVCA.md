# 1 Introduction

The File Set Version Comparison Algorithms are designed to provide a compact representation of a given replica’s file version state and then generate the list of changes between two replicas. See [[MSDN-MSF]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=298530) for related information.

Sections 1.6 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_clock-vector"></a>
**clock vector**: A replica key/tick count pair that represents updates to a replica. Any change that occurs between 0 and the tick count is contained in the vector.

<a id="gt_knowledge"></a>
**knowledge**: The metadata that is maintained by each participant that describes all the changes it has tracked. In its simplest form, known as a watermark, a knowledge item is a clock vector that consists of pairs of replica keys and replica tick counts.

<a id="gt_range"></a>
**range**: A set of continuous item identifiers to which the same clock vector applies. A range is represented by a starting point, an ending point, and a clock vector that applies to all IDs that are in between.

<a id="gt_replica"></a>
**replica**: A particular repository of file and directory information to be synchronized, and the metadata store that represents that repository.

<a id="gt_synchronization-community"></a>
**synchronization community**: A set of replicas that keep their data synchronized with one another.

<a id="gt_tick-count"></a>
**tick count**: A monotonically increasing number that is specific to a replica and combined with a replica key to make a version.

<a id="gt_version"></a>
**version**: A marker that is used to represent an item that has been deleted. A tombstone is used to track deleted items and prevent their reintroduction into the synchronization community.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the [Errata](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=850906).

## 1.3 Overview

These algorithms describe how to build and serialize a compact representation of version state across a data set consisting of files and directories. It also describes how to use this compact version representation to generate a list of changes that a destination replica would need to apply in order to contain all the file and directory versions that the source replica tracks.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Protocols and Other Algorithms

This algorithm does not depend on any other algorithms or protocols. A protocol that depends on this algorithm would need to transfer file and directory data with the goal of keeping datasets that are stored at multiple endpoints synchronized with each other.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Applicability Statement

This algorithm is appropriate for any protocol that tracks version state across file and directory data sets. Protocols can use this algorithm to reduce the number of bits transferred when determining what differences exist between data sets on different endpoints.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Standards Assignments

None.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
