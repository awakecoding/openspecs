# 1 Introduction

The Performance Counter Query Protocol is a [**remote procedure call**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) (RPC)–based protocol that is used for browsing [**performance counters**](#gt_performance-counter) and retrieving performance counter values from a server.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_authentication-service-as"></a>
**Authentication Service (AS)**: A service that issues ticket granting tickets (TGTs), which are used for authenticating principals within the realm or domain served by the [**Authentication Service**](#gt_authentication-service-as).

<a id="gt_counterset"></a>
**counterset**: A logical entity consisting of a group of related [**performance counters**](#gt_performance-counter). For more information, see [[MSDN-COUNT]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89980).

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with [**universally unique identifier (UUID)**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also [**universally unique identifier (UUID)**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid).

<a id="gt_interface-definition-language-idl"></a>
**Interface Definition Language (IDL)**: The International Standards Organization (ISO) standard language for specifying the interface for remote procedure calls. For more information, see [C706] section 4.

<a id="gt_network-data-representation-ndr"></a>
**Network Data Representation (NDR)**: A specification that defines a mapping from [**Interface Definition Language (IDL)**](#gt_interface-definition-language-idl) data types onto octet streams. [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr) also refers to the runtime environment that implements the mapping facilities (for example, data provided to [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr)). For more information, see [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) and [C706] section 14.

<a id="gt_performance-counter"></a>
**performance counter**: A numeric measurement of the performance of one or more computing resources. Bandwidth, Throughputs, and Availability are examples of [**performance counters**](#gt_performance-counter).

<a id="gt_performance-log-users-group"></a>
**Performance Log Users Group**: A set of users that have permission granted by the system administrator to collect [**performance counter**](#gt_performance-counter) information.

<a id="gt_performance-monitor-users-group"></a>
**Performance Monitor Users Group**: A set of users that have permission granted by the system administrator to collect performance counter information.

<a id="gt_provider"></a>
**provider**: A logical entity that updates the [**performance counter**](#gt_performance-counter) values. For more information, see [MSDN-COUNT].

<a id="gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc"></a>
**remote procedure call (RPC)**: A communication protocol used primarily between client and server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message). For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_rpc-protocol-sequence"></a>
**RPC protocol sequence**: A character string that represents a valid combination of a [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol, a network layer protocol, and a transport layer protocol, as described in [C706] and [MS-RPCE].

<a id="gt_rpc-transport"></a>
**RPC transport**: The underlying network services used by the remote procedure call (RPC) runtime for communications between network nodes. For more information, see [C706] section 2.

<a id="gt_system-performance-time"></a>
**system performance time**: A timer that is updated at a hardware-dependent frequency. It has a higher-resolution (more accurate) than [**system time**](#gt_system-time).

<a id="gt_system-time"></a>
**system time**: Coordinated universal time (UTC) with a resolution in milliseconds.

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world. The [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) standard [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16 BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

<a id="gt_unicode-string"></a>
**Unicode string**: A [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) 8-bit string is an ordered sequence of 8-bit units, a [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) 16-bit string is an ordered sequence of 16-bit code units, and a [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) 32-bit string is an ordered sequence of 32-bit code units. In some cases, it could be acceptable not to terminate with a terminating null character. Unless otherwise specified, all [**Unicode strings**](#gt_unicode-string) follow the UTF-16LE encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as [**globally unique identifiers (GUIDs)**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [RFC4122] or [C706] must be used for generating the UUID.

<a id="gt_well-known-endpoint"></a>
**well-known endpoint**: A preassigned, network-specific, stable address for a particular client/server instance. For more information, see [C706].

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

To effectively manage systems, administrators need the capability to query for [**performance counter**](#gt_performance-counter) data on the health or state of a particular application or system. Software components that are designed with performance counters are therefore easier to manage and diagnose. The Performance Counter Query Protocol enables system administrators to query performance counters on a remote server.

The Performance Counter Query Protocol is used to retrieve performance counter information from a server. The protocol allows a client to enumerate the performance counters that are available on the server. The server can use the protocol to return performance counter information, such as localized counter names and description strings, performance counter types (for more information, see [[MSDN-COUNT]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89980)), and instance information if there are multiple instances of a performance counter. The client can also use the protocol to establish a query on the server and add or remove performance counters to it. The client can then repeatedly retrieve performance counter data that is associated with the query by using the protocol.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Performance Counter Query Protocol relies on [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) for its transport. The Performance Counter Query Protocol is not used by any other protocol.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Performance Counter Query Protocol is implemented over [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc), and therefore has those prerequisites that are specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) and that are common to RPC interfaces.

It is assumed that a client has obtained the name or IP address of the server that supports the Performance Counter Query Protocol before invoking the Performance Counter Query Protocol. The protocol also assumes that the client has sufficient security privileges to access files on the server.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Performance Counter Query Protocol is appropriate for querying performance library 2.0–based counter [**providers**](#gt_provider) and their counter data on a server.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document addresses versioning issues in security and authentication methods (as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1) and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md)).

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

The Performance Counter Query Protocol uses Win32 error codes. These values are taken from the Windows error number space that is specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.2. Vendors SHOULD reuse those values with their indicated meaning because choosing any other value risks a collision in the future.

# 2 Messages

This section specifies common data types and how Performance Counter Query Protocol messages are encapsulated on the wire.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The Performance Counter Query Protocol uses the ncacn_np [**RPC protocol sequence**](#gt_rpc-protocol-sequence).

The Performance Counter Query Protocol uses an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) [**well-known endpoint**](#gt_well-known-endpoint). The well-known endpoint is a pipe name (for more information, see [[PIPE]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90247)):

- \PIPE\winreg
The Performance Counter Query Protocol uses security information, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.2.1.1.7. The client MUST specify the RPC [**Authentication Service (AS)**](#gt_authentication-service-as) as SPNEGO or NTLM.

The client MUST use an AS that encrypts all data being transferred to or from the RPC and ensures that the data is from the expected server and has not been modified.

The server MUST perform operations specified by the Performance Counter Query Protocol only if the AS being used encrypts all data being transferred to and from the procedure call and allows the server to perform on the client's behalf.<1> For more information on how the AS encrypts data, see [[MSDN-AUTHLEV]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89956).

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Common Data Types

The Performance Counter Query Protocol MUST indicate to the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) runtime that it is to support the [**Network Data Representation (NDR)**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr) transfer syntax only, as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) part 4.

In addition to RPC base types and definitions, as specified in [C706] and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md), additional data types are defined in the following sections, [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1) through [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3).

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 RPC_HQUERY

This type is declared as follows:

typedef [context_handle] HANDLE RPC_HQUERY;

RPC_HQUERY is a context handle used to maintain information about the [**performance counters**](#gt_performance-counter) that are being queried from the server by the client. The handle is returned by the server when the client initiates communication to query for performance counter data. The client then adds performance counters to a query list, maintained on the server, using the returned handle. When the client queries for the values of the performance counters, the server determines which performance counters to query based on the handle the client passes to the query method. The client closes the handle upon completion of the performance counter query, allowing the server to free the appropriate resources.

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 PRPC_HQUERY

This type is declared as follows:

typedef RPC_HQUERY* PRPC_HQUERY;

PRPC_HQUERY is a pointer to an [RPC_HQUERY](#Section_2.2.1) handle.

<a id="Section_2.2.3"></a>
### 2.2.3 error_status_t

The type error_status_t is the return type from the interface methods; it is represented as an unsigned long. When the interface methods return successfully, the value is 0. Otherwise, it represents the failure that occurred, and its possible values are Win32 error codes, as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md).

<a id="Section_2.2.4"></a>
### 2.2.4 Structures

The following structures, sections [2.2.4.1](#Section_2.2.4.1) through [2.2.4.11](#Section_2.2.4.11), are not defined in the [**Interface Definition Language (IDL)**](#gt_interface-definition-language-idl) file but are necessary to understand the information that is returned by the Performance Counter Query Protocol.

All multibyte data fields in the Performance Counter Query Protocol are little-endian. All the structures MUST begin on 8-byte boundaries, although the data that is contained within the structure need not be aligned to 8-byte boundaries.

<a id="Section_2.2.4.1"></a>
#### 2.2.4.1 _PERF_COUNTERSET_REG_INFO

The _PERF_COUNTERSET_REG_INFO structure contains information about the [**counterset**](#gt_counterset) and is used when enumerating [**performance counter**](#gt_performance-counter) information about the server.

typedef struct _PERF_COUNTERSET_REG_INFO {

GUID CounterSetGuid;

unsigned long CounterSetType;

unsigned long DetailLevel;

unsigned long NumCounters;

unsigned long InstanceType;

} PERF_COUNTERSET_REG_INFO,

*PPERF_COUNTERSET_REG_INFO;

**CounterSetGuid:** A [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) uniquely identifying the counterset.

**CounterSetType:** Unused. MUST be set to 0, and MUST be ignored on receipt.

**DetailLevel:** The detail level of the counterset that is used to indicate the intended target audience. The value MUST be one of the following.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000064 | Novice level. Designed to be accessed by casual users who do not have detailed system knowledge. |
| 0x000000C8 | Advanced level. Designed to be accessed by information technology (IT) administrators who are monitoring multiple machines. |

**NumCounters:** The number of counters that are defined in the counterset.

**InstanceType:** There can be a single or multiple active instances of the counterset, and the client must handle these instances differently. A single active instance of a counterset corresponds to a single active instance of a performance counter within that counterset. This field indicates whether the counterset is single, aggregate, or multiple-instance. The value MUST be one of the following.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 | Single instance. Only one instance of the counterset is active on the system at any time while the system is running. |
| 0x00000002 | Multiple instances. There can be several instances of the counterset active on the system at any time while the system is running. |
| 0x00000004 | Global aggregate. Performs an aggregation operation that is specified in the performance counter definition. The aggregation operation is performed on the client side for each counter in the counterset across all available and active instances of the counterset in the system. |
| 0x00000006 | Multiple-instance aggregate. Performs an aggregation operation that is specified in the performance counter definition. The aggregation operation is performed on the client side for each performance counter in the counterset across a client-specified set of instances of that counterset. For example, a client can average the value of counter "A" from counterset instances "1", "2", and "5". |
| 0x0000000C | Global aggregate history. Performs an aggregation operation that is specified in the counter definition. The aggregation operation is performed on the client side for each performance counter in the counterset across all available instances of the counterset. The result of the aggregation operation can then be cached by the consumer and referenced for later use. For example, if a counter is deleted by the server between client queries, the client can use the value of the counter that was obtained in the last query for the aggregation operation. |
| 0x00000016 | Instance aggregate. Not implemented. |

<a id="Section_2.2.4.2"></a>
#### 2.2.4.2 _PERF_COUNTER_REG_INFO

The _PERF_COUNTER_REG_INFO structure contains information on the counter and is used when enumerating [**performance counter**](#gt_performance-counter) information on the server.

typedef struct _PERF_COUNTER_REG_INFO {

unsigned long CounterId;

unsigned long Type;

unsigned __int64 Attrib;

unsigned long DetailLevel;

long DefaultScale;

unsigned long BaseCounterId;

unsigned long PerfTimeId;

unsigned long PerfFreqId;

unsigned long MultiId;

unsigned long AggregateFunc;

unsigned long Reserved;

} PERF_COUNTER_REG_INFO,

*PPERF_COUNTER_REG_INFO;

**CounterId:** The numeric identifier of the counter. A performance counter's **CounterId** value MUST be unique within its counterset.

**Type:** The type of counter. The client MAY need to perform numeric operations on the value of the counter that is retrieved from the server to use it for analysis. Unless explicitly stated as an instantaneous value, the client MAY need to cache the value of the counter to compare it with the value from the next query. The value MUST be one of the following.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER 0x10410400 | The counter data is a 32-bit value that indicates the rate of events being counted per second. To get the rate, the client takes the difference between counter values from two subsequent queries and divides it by the time difference between the two query time stamps. The unit of time is [**system time**](#gt_system-time). The value is displayed as a rate of counts per second. |

# 3 Protocol Details

The client side of the Performance Counter Query Protocol is simply a pass-through. Therefore, no additional timers or other states are required on the client side of the Performance Counter Query Protocol. Calls made by the higher-layer protocol or application are passed directly to the transport, and the results that are returned by the transport are passed directly back to the higher-layer protocol or application.

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Server Details

The server handles client requests for any of the methods, as specified in section [3.1.4](#Section_3.2.4), and operates on the performance counters on the server.

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in the Performance Counter Query Protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with what is described in this document.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.1"></a>
#### 3.1.1.1 Countersets

[**Performance counters**](#gt_performance-counter) are organized into [**countersets**](#gt_counterset). Each counterset is a logical grouping of one or more performance counters. A counterset is identified by a [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) and a name.

For example, a processor counterset can contain performance counters related to the system processor (CPU).

<a id="Section_3.1.1.2"></a>
#### 3.1.1.2 Counterset Instances

Depending on the entity that is updating the [**performance counter**](#gt_performance-counter) value, multiple instances of a [**counterset**](#gt_counterset) can exist. For example, a single-processor machine has only one instance of a counterset that contains processor-related performance counters; however, a dual-processor machine has two instances.

Each instance of a counterset is identified by a numeric ID and name.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.3"></a>
#### 3.1.1.3 Counters

Each [**performance counter**](#gt_performance-counter) in a [**counterset**](#gt_counterset) is identified by a numeric ID; a counter can be uniquely identified on the system by using the counterset [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid), counterset instance name or ID, and counter ID. Each performance counter can have a localized name and description, type, and detail level among other metadata fields. Depending on the type of performance counter, it can be necessary to use the value of other performance counters to calculate the value.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.4"></a>
#### 3.1.1.4 Providers

[**Performance counter**](#gt_performance-counter) values are updated by logical entities called [**providers**](#gt_provider). The providers are registered within the system, and they create the [**counterset**](#gt_counterset) instances using implementation-specific mechanisms. For each created instance, the system maintains information about the provider that is updating that instance.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.5"></a>
#### 3.1.1.5 Query Handles

Clients can perform two types of query operations on the server by using the Performance Counter Query Protocol: Browse the [**counterset**](#gt_counterset) and [**performance counter**](#gt_performance-counter) metadata on the server or query the performance counter values from the counterset instances. When a client requests browsing countersets or performance counter metadata (sections [3.1.4.1.1](#Section_3.1.4.1.1), [3.1.4.1.2](#Section_3.1.4.1.2), and [3.1.4.1.3](#Section_3.1.4.1.3)), the server does not associate any state with these requests, but simply sends to the client the available metadata on the system.

When a client wants to query the server for performance counter values from counterset instances, it uses the Performance Counter Query Protocol to create an RPC_HQUERY handle on the server. The server maintains a single table of query handles associating client connections to internal server states related to the connection. For each handle, the server keeps a list of performance counter identifiers (for more information about performance counter identifiers see section [2.2.4.6](#Section_2.2.4.6)). The client can add or remove performance counter identifiers from the list, as specified in section [3.1.4.1.7](#Section_3.1.4.1.7).

When the client makes the query operation (see section [3.1.4.1.6](#Section_3.1.4.1.6)), the server retrieves the performance counter values from the system by using system interfaces; the server passes to these interfaces the list of performance counter identifiers associated with the query handle. For each performance counter identifier, the system retrieves the performance counter value from its corresponding provider and returns it to the server. The server accumulates the values and sends the data to the client.

In addition, the client can enumerate the performance counter metadata about the performance counters it added to the query handle. In that case, the server returns the performance counter information that is associated with the RPC_HQUERY handle passed from the client (section [3.1.4.1.5](#Section_3.1.4.1.5)).

In certain cases, aggregation operations, such as addition or an average, can be performed by the client after it retrieves the performance counter values from the server. The counterset identifies whether an aggregation operation can be performed, and each performance counter in the counterset specifies a specific aggregation operation.

For example, a performance counter being queried by the client, associated with the RPC_HQUERY handle, can belong to a counterset of type Multiple Instance Aggregate. The AggregateFunc property of this performance counter, which is a member of the _PERF_COUNTER_REG_INFO structure, can be set to value 0x00000001. In this case, all instances that the client queries will be returned; the client component of the performance counter infrastructure will use these values to calculate the total sum of the instances of that performance counter, to pass back to the requesting application.

When the client no longer needs to query the server for performance counter values, it closes the RPC_HQUERY handle; afterward, the server can free any resources that are associated with the handle.

### 3.1.2 Timers

No protocol timers are required—other than the internal ones that are used in [**remote procedure calls**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) to implement resiliency to network outages, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The Performance Counter Query Protocol MUST indicate to the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) runtime that it is to perform a strict [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr) data consistency check at target level 6.0, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.

The Performance Counter Query Protocol MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to reject a NULL unique or full pointer with a nonzero conformant value, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 3.

The Performance Counter Query Protocol MUST indicate to the RPC runtime through the **strict_context_handle** attribute that it is to reject use of context handles that are created by a method of a different RPC interface than this one, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 3.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.1"></a>
#### 3.1.4.1 PerflibV2 Interface

The PerflibV2 interface is a set of methods that the client can use to enumerate [**performance counter**](#gt_performance-counter) metadata and query performance counter values on a server. The client can view all the counters that are installed on the system. After the client has decided which performance counters are of interest, it can open a query on the server and add the necessary counters. The client then queries these counters, upon which the server returns the values of the counters that are specified by the client. The client closes the query on the server once it has queried the counters for the necessary duration.

##### 3.1.4.1.6 PerflibV2QueryCounterData (Opnum 6)

The PerflibV2QueryCounterData method retrieves data for the [**performance counters**](#gt_performance-counter) associated with the query. Performance counters can be added or removed from queries by calling [PerflibV2ValidateCounters](#Section_3.1.4.1.7).

error_status_t PerflibV2QueryCounterData(

[in] RPC_HQUERY hQuery,

[in, range(0, 1073741824)] DWORD dwInSize,

[out] DWORD* pdwOutSize,

[out] DWORD* pdwRtnSize,

[out, size_is(dwInSize), length_is(* pdwOutSize)]

unsigned char* lpData

);

**hQuery:** The handle returned by the [PerflibV2OpenQueryHandle](#Section_3.1.4.1.4) method; an exception is thrown or an error is returned by RPC if the handle did not originate from the PerflibV2OpenQueryHandle method.

**dwInSize:** The size, in bytes, of the buffer.

**pdwOutSize:** The size, in bytes, of the data that is returned and written to the buffer.

**pdwRtnSize:** The necessary size, in bytes, to retrieve all the requested data.

**lpData:** The buffer that contains the requested counter information.

**Return Values:** This method MUST return zero (ERROR_SUCCESS) for success; otherwise, it MUST return one of the standard Windows error codes, as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.2.

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 ERROR_SUCCESS | The return value indicates success. |
| 0x00000005 ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED | The server returns this value to the client if the authentication level of the client is less than RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY. |
| 0x00000008 ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY | The server will return this value to the client if the size of the buffer pointed to by lpData is not of sufficient size to return the performance counter values to the client. |

The server MUST return a [_PERF_DATA_HEADER](#Section_2.2.4.7) structure that is followed by a set of [_PERF_COUNTER_HEADER](#Section_2.2.4.8) blocks. The format of the _PERF_COUNTER_HEADER block MUST be determined by the **dwType** field of the _PERF_COUNTER_HEADER structure.

##### 3.1.4.1.7 PerflibV2ValidateCounters (Opnum 7)

This PerflibV2ValidateCounters method either adds or removes [**performance counters**](#gt_performance-counter) from the query.

error_status_t PerflibV2ValidateCounters(

[in] RPC_HQUERY hQuery,

[in, range(0, 67108864)] DWORD dwInSize,

[in, out, size_is(dwInSize)] unsigned char* lpData,

[in] DWORD dwAdd

);

**hQuery:** The handle that is created by the [PerflibV2OpenQueryHandle](#Section_3.1.4.1.4) method; an exception is thrown or an error is returned by RPC if the handle did not originate from the PerflibV2OpenQueryHandle method.

**dwInSize:** The size, in bytes, of the buffer.

**lpData:** The buffer that contains the counter information to add to, or remove from, the query. The server will return this buffer after it has attempted to add or remove the specified counters; the **Status** field of each [_PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER](#Section_2.2.4.6) structure will contain information about whether or not the server was successful.

**dwAdd:** A Boolean value that indicates if counters are being added to, or removed from, the query. If counters are being added, this MUST be set to TRUE; otherwise, it MUST be set to FALSE.

**Return Values:** This method MUST return zero (ERROR_SUCCESS) for success; otherwise, it MUST return one of the standard Windows error codes, as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.2.

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 ERROR_SUCCESS | The return value indicates success. |
| 0x00000005 ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED | The server returns this value to the client if the authentication level of the client is less than RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY. |
| 0x00000057 ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER | The server returns this value to the client for any of the following reasons: dwSize is less than the size of the _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER structure (this condition would prevent the server from returning information about one counter). The size of a single _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER structure that is passed into the buffer by the client is smaller than the expected size of a _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER structure. |
| 0x0000000E ERROR_OUTOFMEMORY | The server will return this value to the client if, in the process of completing the client's request of adding or removing performance counters from the query, a memory allocation fails. |

Errors are returned to the client by the server in one of two ways: the first is if the performance counter infrastructure on the server could not add or remove performance counters from the query; the second is if the [**provider**](#gt_provider) that is exposing the performance counter returns an error, in which case the performance counter infrastructure passes the error back to the client.

When the PerflibV2ValidateCounters method returns, the **Status** field of each _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER sent to the server will have the result of whether or not the server was able to successfully add or remove that particular performance counter from the query that is identified by the handle hQuery.

If the performance counter infrastructure is setting the Status field to an error value, then it MUST be one of the following values.

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 ERROR_STATUS | The return value indicates success. The counter was either successfully added or removed from the query. |
| 0x00001068 ERROR_WMI_GUID_NOT_FOUND | The server cannot find the GUID that was passed by the client in the CounterSetGuid field of the _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER structure. |
| 0x0000106A ERROR_WMI_ITEMID_NOT_ FOUND | The server cannot find the counter whose numeric identifier is in the CounterId field of the _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER structure. |
| 0x00000003 ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND | The server cannot find an active instance with the name that was placed after the _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER structure. |
| 0x000000B7 ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS | The client tried to add a performance counter that has already been added in a previous call to PerflibV2ValidateCounters. |
| ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER 0x00000057 | The server will return this value in the Status field of the _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER either when the _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER is corrupt, or if the server cannot find the counter to delete from the query that is specified by the structure. |
| 0x0000000E ERROR_OUTOFMEMORY | The server will return this value to the client if, either in the process of adding or removing a counter from a query, a memory allocation failure occurred. |

When this method is called, the buffer MUST contain an array of _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER blocks that reference the performance counters to add to, or remove from, the query. Each _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER block MUST contain a _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER structure; a multiple-instance counter set _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER structure MUST be followed by a null-terminated [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) string instance name, while a single-instance counter set _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER structure MUST be followed by a string instance name. Setting the **CounterId** field of the _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER structure to 0xFFFFFFFF indicates a wildcard character. Setting the instance name string to "*" indicates a wildcard character.

When the method returns, the **Status** field of each _PERF_COUNTER_IDENTIFIER structure in the array MUST specify if the operation succeeded for the counters that are referenced by that structure.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.1.8"></a>
##### 3.1.4.1.8 PerflibV2CloseQueryHandle (Opnum 4)

The PerflibV2CloseQueryHandle method closes the handle that is returned from the [PerflibV2OpenQueryHandle](#Section_3.1.4.1.4) method.

error_status_t PerflibV2CloseQueryHandle(

[in, out] PRPC_HQUERY phQuery

);

**phQuery:** A handle that is created by the PerflibV2OpenQueryHandle method. An exception is thrown or an error is returned by [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) if the handle did not originate from the PerflibV2OpenQueryHandle method. On method return, *phQuery* MUST be set to NULL.

**Return Values:** This method MUST return zero (ERROR_SUCCESS) for success; otherwise, it MUST return one of the standard Windows errors, as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.2.

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 ERROR_SUCCESS | The return value indicates success. |
| 0x00000005 ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED | The server returns this value to the client if the authentication level of the client is less than RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY. The opened handle, *phQuery*, remains in that state until the client calls PerflibV2CloseQueryHandle with authentication level RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY. |

### 3.1.5 Timer Events

No timer events are required except for the events that are maintained in the underlying [**RPC transport**](#gt_rpc-transport).

<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>
### 3.1.6 Other Local Events

There are no local events inherently associated with the Performance Counter Query Protocol.

<a id="Section_3.2"></a>
## 3.2 Client Details

<a id="Section_3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

The state information that is required for successful operation of the Performance Counter Query Protocol is primarily stored on the server; other than the handle that is obtained from the [PerflibV2OpenQueryHandle (section 3.1.4.1.4)](#Section_3.1.4.1.4) method, all information such as the list of [**performance counters**](#gt_performance-counter) being queried is stored on the server.

If the client simply wants to either enumerate the available [**countersets**](#gt_counterset) or counterset instances on the server, or retrieve information about the counterset or counters that belong to the counterset, it does not need to establish a handle with the server by calling the PerflibV2OpenQueryHandle method. The client can simply call the [PerflibV2EnumerateCounterSet (section 3.1.4.1.1)](#Section_3.1.4.1.1), [PerflibV2EnumerateCounterSetInstances (section 3.1.4.1.3)](#Section_3.1.4.1.3), or [PerflibV2QueryCounterSetRegistrationInfo (section 3.1.4.1.2)](#Section_3.1.4.1.2) methods to retrieve the necessary information from the server.

If the client wants to query for performance counter data, or performance counter metadata associated with a particular query, from the server, then it first creates a handle. The client creates a handle by calling the PerflibV2OpenQueryHandlemethod. The server, upon receiving this call, stores the client machine information it receives from the RPC layer. The server also uses this handle to associate back to the client the performance counter2 that the client adds to the query by calling [PerflibV2ValidateCounters (section 3.1.4.1.7)](#Section_3.1.4.1.7). The server then returns this handle back to the client. The purpose of the handle is for the server to be able to distinguish between different client performance counter queries; the information that is passed back to the client, in the form of an [RPC_HQUERY (section 2.2.1)](#Section_2.2.1) handle, only contains the information necessary for the server to distinguish between separate queries. The client does not have knowledge of the contents or structure of the handle. For example, a specific implementation of the Performance Counter Query Protocol MAY return back a 32-bit unsigned numeric identifier as an RPC_HQUERY handle to the client; the client will then use this RPC_HQUERY handle, without explicit knowledge that the representation is a 32-bit unsigned integer, in subsequent communication to the server to query for performance counter data.

When the client has completed its necessary communication with the server, it closes the handle it obtained from the server by calling PerflibV2CloseQueryHandle. This allows the server to free any information it retained with respect to the client's query (such as the list of performance counters that were being queried). The client can also free the memory that is associated with the RPC_HQUERY handle.

<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

No protocol timers are required—other than those internal ones that are used in [**remote procedure calls**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) to implement resiliency to network outages, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

There is no client-side initialization.

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The Performance Counter Query Protocol MUST indicate to the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) runtime that it is to perform a strict [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr) data consistency check at target level 6.0, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.

The Performance Counter Query Protocol MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to reject a NULL unique or full pointer with a nonzero conformant value, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 3.

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Timer Events

No timer events are required except for the events that are maintained in the underlying [**RPC transport**](#gt_rpc-transport).

<a id="Section_3.2.6"></a>
### 3.2.6 Other Local Events

There are no client-specific local events.

<a id="Section_4"></a>
# 4 Protocol Examples

The following example demonstrates the usage of the Performance Counter Query Protocol. The client queries the value of certain [**performance counters**](#gt_performance-counter) that are organized into one [**counterset**](#gt_counterset) that is found on the server.

<a id="Section_4.1"></a>
## 4.1 Querying for Performance Counter Data

![Querying for performance counter data](media/image10.png)

Figure 10: Querying for performance counter data

- The client calls [PerflibV2EnumerateCounterSet](#Section_3.1.4.1.1) on the server.
- The server returns all the available [**countersets**](#gt_counterset) to the client.
- The client selects a counterset based on [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) and calls [PerflibV2QueryCounterSetRegistrationInfo](#Section_3.1.4.1.2) by using RequestCode = 0x00000001.
- The server returns the counterset information of the counterset that is specified by the GUID in PerflibV2QueryCounterSetRegistrationInfo, in addition to information about the [**performance counters**](#gt_performance-counter) that belong to the counterset.
- To query the performance counter data of certain counters, the client calls [PerflibV2OpenQueryHandle](#Section_3.1.4.1.4) to open a handle to a query on the server.
- The server returns a handle to a query; the client uses this handle to specify the performance counters whose values are to be queried.
- The client, using the information that was returned from PerflibV2QueryCounterSetRegistrationInfo, specifies the performance counters from the counterset that are to be queried.
- The client calls [PerflibV2ValidateCounters](#Section_3.1.4.1.7) with the *dwAdd* parameter set to TRUE to add the counters to the query that is specified by the handle that is returned in step 6.
- The server adds the performance counter information to the query that is specified by the handle and returns.
- The client calls [PerflibV2QueryCounterData](#Section_3.1.4.1.6) to retrieve the values of the performance counters that are stored in the query that is specified by the handle.
- The server returns the values of the performance counters in the query that is specified by the handle.
- The client calls PerflibV2CloseQueryHandle to close the handle that it obtained in step 6 because it is finished querying the server.
- The server releases all resources that are associated with the query that is specified by the handle and returns.

# 5 Security

The following sections specify security considerations for implementers of the Performance Counter Query Protocol.

<a id="Section_5.1"></a>
## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

The Performance Counter Query Protocol introduces no security considerations except for those that are applicable to [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc). Specifically, the client is required to use the RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY authentication level.

# 7 Appendix B: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

The terms "earlier" and "later", when used with a product version, refer to either all preceding versions or all subsequent versions, respectively. The term "through" refers to the inclusive range of versions. Applicable Microsoft products are listed chronologically in this section.

**Windows Client**

- Windows Vista operating system
- Windows 7 operating system
- Windows 8 operating system
- Windows 8.1 operating system
- Windows 10 operating system
- Windows 11 operating system
**Windows Server**

- Windows Server 2008 operating system
- Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system
- Windows Server 2016 operating system
- Windows Server operating system
- Windows Server 2019 operating system
- Windows Server 2022 operating system
- Windows Server 2025 operating system
Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 2.1: Applicable Windows Server releases will impersonate the client; the minimum impersonation level is RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE. Windows only allows system administrators, members of the [**Performance Log Users Group**](#gt_performance-log-users-group), and members of the [**Performance Monitor Users Group**](#gt_performance-monitor-users-group) to perform operations that are related to querying [**performance counter**](#gt_performance-counter) data or metadata. For more information on how an [**AS**](#gt_authentication-service-as) allows servers to act on the behalf of clients, see [[MSDN-IMPLVL]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90023).

<2> Section 2.2.4.2: Windows applications that use the performance counter infrastructure organize the performance counter into countersets. In order to update a performance counter, the application must first create an active instance of that counterset; this in turn will create an active instance of the performance counter that belongs to that counterset. The application can then update that instance of the performance counter with the appropriate values.

On Windows, when an application wants to create an active instance of a counterset, the performance counter infrastructure will allocate memory in the application's process space to store the values of the different performance counters belonging to that instance of the counterset. The application then makes a method call to update a particular performance counter; this function finds the appropriate place in the memory where the counter value for the performance counter being updated resides, and updates that memory with the new value. When a client queries the performance counter value, the performance counter infrastructure simply copies the contents of the memory corresponding to that performance counter instance.

Alternatively, an application can provide a pointer to the performance counter. Thus, when the application creates an instance of the performance counter, the memory space that would normally contain the performance counter value instead contains a pointer to the variable containing the performance counter value. This is done by calling a method that initializes the memory contents of that performance counter instance to be the address of a variable. Thus, when a client queries for the performance counter, the infrastructure can't simply copy the contents of the memory; it must use that memory as an address to find the actual performance counter value. In order to instruct the infrastructure that the contents of the memory corresponding to a performance counter instance is an address and not the actual performance counter value, the **Attrib** field of the _PERF_COUNTER_REG_INFO structure that defines the performance counter must be set to Reference (0x0000000000000001).

<3> Section 2.2.4.5: Windows does not enforce that the combination of instance name and instance be unique for a particular counterset.

<4> Section 3.1.4.1.2: Windows Vista and later and Windows Server 2008 and later incorrectly attempt to load the resources that correspond to *RequestCode* when *RequestCode* equals 0x00000001, 0x00000007, 0x00000008, 0x00000009, or 0x0000000A; if they are unable to do so, Windows returns an error code.
