# 1 Introduction

The Windows Error Codes document is a companion reference to the protocol specifications. It documents the common usage details for those [HRESULT values](#Section_2.1.1), [Win32 error codes](#Section_2.2), and [NTSTATUS values](#Section_2.3.1) that are referenced by specifications in the protocol documentation set.

Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_hresult"></a>
**HRESULT**: An integer value that indicates the result or status of an operation. A particular HRESULT can have different meanings depending on the protocol using it. See [MS-ERREF](#Section_1bc92ddfb79e413cbbaa99a5281a6c90) section 2.1 and specific protocol documents for further details.

<a id="gt_terminal-server"></a>
**terminal server**: A computer on which [**terminal services**](#gt_terminal-services-ts) is running.

<a id="gt_terminal-services-ts"></a>
**terminal services (TS)**: A service on a server computer that allows delivery of applications, or the desktop itself, to various computing devices. When a user runs an application on a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server), the application execution takes place on the server computer and only keyboard, mouse, and display information is transmitted over the network. Each user sees only his or her individual session, which is managed transparently by the server operating system and is independent of any other client session.

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and RPC objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) has to be used for generating the UUID.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.2 References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the [Errata](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=850906).

<a id="Section_1.2.2"></a>
### 1.2.2 Informative References

None.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

If a protocol returns [**HRESULTs**](#gt_hresult), the protocol uses HRESULTs, as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1.1).

If a protocol uses Win32 error codes, these values are taken from the Windows error number space, as specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2).

If a protocol uses NTSTATUS values, these values are specified in section [2.3](#Section_2.3.1).

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Protocols and Other Structures

The structures documented in this specification do not depend on any other structures or protocols.

The structures in this document are returned by many protocols.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Applicability Statement

The data types specified in this document are applicable for use in any protocol that needs to include a discrete set of error codes.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Versioning and Localization

The structures in the Windows Error Codes require no versioning or localization information.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Vendor Extensible Fields

[HRESULTs](#Section_2.1.1): Vendors can choose their own values, as long as the **C** bit (0x20000000) is set, indicating it is a customer code. The structures documented in this specification have no vendor-extensible fields.

[Win32 Error Codes](#Section_2.2): Vendors can only reuse these values with their indicated meanings. Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the future.

[NTSTATUS](#Section_2.3.1): Vendors can choose their own values for this field, as long as the **C** bit (0x20000000) is set, indicating it is a customer code.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Structures

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 HRESULT

The HRESULT numbering space is vendor-extensible. Vendors can supply their own values for this field, as long as the **C** bit (0x20000000) is set, indicating it is a customer code.

The HRESULT numbering space has the following internal structure. Any protocol that uses NTSTATUS values on the wire is responsible for stating the order in which the bytes are placed on the wire.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-0: "S"
  1-1: "R"
  2-2: "C"
  3-3: "N"
  4-4: "X"
  5-15: "Facility"
  16-31: "Code"
```

**S (1 bit):** Severity. If set, indicates a failure result. If clear, indicates a success result.

**R (1 bit):** Reserved. If the **N** bit is clear, this bit MUST be set to 0. If the **N** bit is set, this bit is defined by the NTSTATUS numbering space (as specified in section [2.3](#Section_2.3.1)).

**C (1 bit):** Customer. This bit specifies if the value is customer-defined or Microsoft-defined. The bit is set for customer-defined values and clear for Microsoft-defined values.<1>

**N (1 bit):** If set, indicates that the error code is an NTSTATUS value (as specified in section 2.3), except that this bit is set.

**X (1 bit):** Reserved. SHOULD be set to 0. <2>

**Facility (11 bits):** An indicator of the source of the error. New facilities are occasionally added by Microsoft.

### 2.1.1 HRESULT Values

Combining the fields of an [**HRESULT**](#gt_hresult) into a single, 32-bit numbering space, the following HRESULT values are defined, in addition to those derived from [NTSTATUS values (section 2.3.1)](#Section_2.3) and [Win32 error codes (section 2.2)](#Section_2.2). This document provides the common usage details of the HRESULTs; individual protocol specifications provide expanded or modified definitions.

Most values also have a default message defined, which can be used to map the value to a human-readable text message; when this is done, the HRESULT value is also known as a message identifier.

Note: In the following descriptions, a percentage sign (%) followed by one or more alphanumeric characters (for example, "%1" or "%hs") indicates a variable that is replaced by text at the time the value is returned.

### 2.1.2 HRESULT From WIN32 Error Code Macro

The HRESULT From WIN32 Error Code Macro converts a Win32 error code to an HRESULT using the pattern 0x8007XXXX, where XXXX is the first two bytes of the Win32 hex value 0x0000XXXX.

The macro is as follows:

#define FACILITY_WIN32 0x0007

#define __HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(x) ((HRESULT)(x) <= 0 ? ((HRESULT)(x)) : ((HRESULT) (((x) & 0x0000FFFF) | (FACILITY_WIN32 << 16) | 0x80000000)))

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Win32 Error Codes

All Win32 error codes MUST be in the range 0x0000 to 0xFFFF, although Win32 error codes can be used both in 16-bit fields (such as within the [**HRESULT**](#gt_hresult) type specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1.1)) as well as 32-bit fields. Most values also have a default message defined, which can be used to map the value to a human-readable text message; when this is done, the Win32 error code is also known as a message identifier.

The following table specifies the values and corresponding meanings of the Win32 error codes. Vendors SHOULD NOT assign other meanings to these values, to avoid the risk of a collision in the future.

This document provides the common usage details of the Win32 error codes; individual protocol specifications provide expanded or modified definitions.

**Note** In the following descriptions, a percentage sign followed by one or more alphanumeric characters (for example, "%1" or "%hs") indicates a variable that will be replaced by text at the time the value is returned.

## 2.3 NTSTATUS

Values are 32 bit and are laid out as follows. The following diagram is independent of endianness; that is, the diagram is shown in host byte order and merely shows the layout of the numbering space.

Any protocol that uses NTSTATUS values on the wire is responsible for stating the order that the bytes are placed on the wire.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-1: "Sev"
  2-2: "C"
  3-3: "N"
  4-15: "Facility"
  16-31: "Code"
```

**Sev (2 bits):** Severity. Severity codes are as follows.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| STATUS_SEVERITY_SUCCESS 0x0 | Success |
| STATUS_SEVERITY_INFORMATIONAL 0x1 | Informational |
| STATUS_SEVERITY_WARNING 0x2 | Warning |
| STATUS_SEVERITY_ERROR 0x3 | Error |

**C (1 bit):** Customer. This specifies if the value is customer- or Microsoft-defined. This bit is set for customer-defined values and clear for Microsoft-defined values.<4>

**N (1 bit):** Reserved. MUST be set to 0 so that it is possible to map an NTSTATUS value to an equivalent [HRESULT value](#Section_2.1.1), as specified in section 2.1, by setting this bit.

**Facility (12 bits):** A value that, together with the **C** bit, indicates the numbering space to use for the **Code** field.<5>

**Code (2 bytes):** The remainder of the error code. Vendors SHOULD reuse the values in the following table with their indicated meaning or define their own values with the **C** bit set. Choosing any other value with the **C** bit clear runs the risk of a collision in the future.

<a id="Section_2.3.1"></a>
### 2.3.1 NTSTATUS Values

By combining the NTSTATUS into a single 32-bit numbering space, the following NTSTATUS values are defined. Most values also have a defined default message that can be used to map the value to a human-readable text message. When this is done, the NTSTATUS value is also known as a message identifier.

This document provides the common usage details of the NTSTATUS values; individual protocol specifications provide expanded or modified definitions when needed.

In the following descriptions, a percentage sign that is followed by one or more alphanumeric characters (for example, "%1" or "%hs") indicates a variable that is replaced by text at the time the value is returned.

## 2.4 LDAP Error to Win32 Error Mapping

Windows contains an implementation of the LDAP resultCode ([[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325) section 4.1.10) which is used by higher-layer protocols to interpret the results of an LDAP operation.

Each LDAP error value is also mapped to the closest Win32 error value, for use by the higher-layer protocols. This mapping is as shown in the following table:

| Value: Decimal | Value: Hexadecimal representation | LDAPResult.resultCode: RFC 1777 | LDAPResult.resultCode: RFC 2251 | Windows: Ldap Error (LDAP_RETCODE from winldap.w) | Windows: Win32 error (from LdapMapErrorToWin32 / winmain\ds\ds\src\ldap\client\util.cxx) |
