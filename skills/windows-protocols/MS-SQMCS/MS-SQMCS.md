# 1 Introduction

This document is a specification of the Software Quality Metrics (SQM) Client-to-Service Protocol Version 1 which is used to send software instrumentation metrics to the SQM service and by the client to download client-specific control data. The protocol allows applications and operating system components to collect and send instrumentation metrics to a hosted service over HTTP/HTTPS.

Data upload can also be transmitted through a customer-hosted SQM proxy to the SQM service. This proxy transmits protocol messages on behalf of a client in environments in which the client cannot access the [**SQM service**](#gt_sqm-service).

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_adaptive-software-quality-metrics-a-sqm"></a>
**adaptive software quality metrics (A-SQM)**: A component that permits the ability to trigger the collection of data or provide application-defined callbacks based on the state of a set of SQM instrumentation data.

<a id="gt_augmented-backus-naur-form-abnf"></a>
**Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)**: A modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), commonly used by Internet specifications. ABNF notation balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power. ABNF differs from standard BNF in its definitions and uses of naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges. For more information, see [[RFC5234]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096).

<a id="gt_binary-large-object-blob"></a>
**binary large object (BLOB)**: A collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database.

<a id="gt_checksum"></a>
**checksum**: A value that is the summation of a byte stream. By comparing the checksums computed from a data item at two different times, one can quickly assess whether the data items are identical.

<a id="gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc"></a>
**Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**: A high-precision atomic time standard that approximately tracks Universal Time (UT). It is the basis for legal, civil time all over the Earth. Time zones around the world are expressed as positive and negative offsets from UTC. In this role, it is also referred to as Zulu time (Z) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). In these specifications, all references to UTC refer to the time at UTC-0 (or GMT).

<a id="gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http"></a>
**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: An application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the World Wide Web.

<a id="gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-secure-https"></a>
**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**: An extension of HTTP that securely encrypts and decrypts web page requests. In some older protocols, "Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Sockets Layer" is still used (Secure Sockets Layer has been deprecated). For more information, see [[SSL3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90534) and [[RFC5246]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129803).

<a id="gt_instrumentation-data"></a>
**instrumentation data**: Data values that measure the attributes of a system. The values can represent a dynamic measurement, such as a change over time; or they can represent static values, such as a program name or version number.

<a id="gt_man-in-the-middle-mitm"></a>
**man in the middle (MITM)**: An attack that deceives a server or client into accepting an unauthorized upstream host as the actual legitimate host. Instead, the upstream host is an attacker's host that is manipulating the network so that the attacker's host appears to be the desired destination. This enables the attacker to decrypt and access all network traffic that would go to the legitimate host. The attacker is able to read, insert, and modify at-will messages between two hosts without either party knowing that the link between them is compromised.

<a id="gt_sqm-partner"></a>
**SQM partner**: An abstract entity within the SQM service that logically groups instrumentation information.

<a id="gt_sqm-service"></a>
**SQM service**: Accepts and stores SQM session data from SQM-enabled clients. The SQM service manages SQM partner information and SQM partner instrumentation definitions.

<a id="gt_sqm-enabled-client"></a>
**SQM-enabled client**: A computer on which nonidentifiable instrumentation data is collected into a SQM session and sent to the SQM service.

<a id="gt_unicode-character"></a>
**Unicode character**: Unless otherwise specified, a 16-bit UTF-16 code unit.

<a id="gt_unicode-string"></a>
**Unicode string**: A Unicode 8-bit string is an ordered sequence of 8-bit units, a Unicode 16-bit string is an ordered sequence of 16-bit code units, and a Unicode 32-bit string is an ordered sequence of 32-bit code units. In some cases, it could be acceptable not to terminate with a terminating null character. Unless otherwise specified, all [**Unicode strings**](#gt_unicode-string) follow the UTF-16LE encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The Software Quality Metrics (SQM) Client-to-Service Protocol defines how a [**SQM-enabled client**](#gt_sqm-enabled-client) sends [**instrumentation data**](#gt_instrumentation-data) to the [**SQM service**](#gt_sqm-service). The SQM Client-to-Service Protocol specifies the data transfer method, which includes an instrumentation namespace identifier and binary structured instrumentation data.

SQM-enabled clients produce and send SQM instrumentation data. This data allows application developers to understand product usage and failure information in order to improve their applications. Each SQM-enabled client belongs to a SQM namespace known as a [**SQM partner**](#gt_sqm-partner). All SQM data is associated with a SQM partner namespace in the SQM service.

The instrumentation data definition is defined by the SQM service. The meaning of the data is known to the creator of the data definition. For example, an instrumentation data definition COUNT_FILE_NOT_FOUND that is created and instrumented by an application developer has a specific meaning to that application developer. It could mean the number of times a data file is not found, the number of times a library file is not found, or something else entirely. The structure and method of transferring the data from the SQM-enabled client to the SQM service is defined by the SQM Client-to-Service Protocol. The method of creating the SQM instrumentation data definition is SQM service implementation-specific.

The SQM Client-to-Service Protocol also defines a method for a SQM-enabled client to download SQM partner-specific information. Typically this information is used by the SQM-enabled client to control what instrumentation data is uploaded. This functionality is known as [**adaptive software quality metrics (A-SQM)**](#gt_adaptive-software-quality-metrics-a-sqm). A-SQM data is created at the SQM service by the SQM-enabled client application owner if the SQM partner wants to download and use this functionality. The method of creating the A-SQM data is SQM service implementation-specific.

The SQM Client-to-Service Protocol uses the following communication methods:

- Uploading instrumentation data from the client to the SQM service by using HTTP/HTTPS POST.
- Uploading instrumentation data through a proxy (relay) to the SQM service.
- Downloading A-SQM data created at the SQM service by using HTTP/HTTPS GET.
<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol depends on the [**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http) and [**Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Sockets Layer (HTTPS)**](#gt_9239bd88-9747-44a6-83a6-473f53f175a7) for transport, as specified in [[RFC2616]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90372).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

To use the SQM service, a client registers as a [**SQM partner**](#gt_sqm-partner) with the SQM service and adds SQM instrumentation to the client application.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is applicable only to SQM-enabled clients that are enabled to collect telemetry data using the SQM service.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

The SQM Client-to-Service Protocol does not perform capacity or version negotiation. The client communicates with a SQM service that supports version 1 of the SQM Client-to-Service Protocol. The protocol uses HTTP/HTTPS as the transport.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

None.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

This protocol is implemented on top of HTTP/HTTPS. A proxy MAY impose additional requirements as part of the transfer. There is no authentication between the SQM client and SQM service, or between the SQM proxy and the SQM service.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Namespaces

SQM data MUST be associated with a partner namespace. The SQM Client-to-Service Protocol uses HTTP 1.1 syntax to communicate the [**SQM partner**](#gt_sqm-partner) namespace within the URL string. For data upload, the URL MUST contain the SQM partner namespace following the SQM service host name.<1>

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 Message Upload Data Contents

Messages are uploaded by using HTTP/HTTPS POST. The binary data is contained in the POST body of the HTTP/HTTPS request. The binary data schema is laid out in a SQM session, as shown in Figure 1 and described in section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3). The SQM section data area MAY be compressed as shown in Figure 3. The SQM service decompresses the data upon receipt. The entire binary data package MUST be included in a single HTTP POST body. The common message structures and layout are described in section [2.2.4](#Section_2.2.4).

![HTTP POST body containing a SQM session](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: HTTP POST body containing a SQM session

<a id="Section_2.2.3"></a>
### 2.2.3 SQM Session

A SQM session is comprised of a SQM header and zero or more SQM sections within the [**binary large object (BLOB)**](#gt_binary-large-object-blob) as shown in Figure 2. The SQM-enabled client MAY send the SQM header only (for example, to query the A-SQM Manifest version). The total length, in bytes, of the SQM session (the SQM header and SQM sections) MUST equal the HTTP POST body length. All integer fields are encoded using little-endian format.

### 2.2.4 Common Structures

<a id="Section_2.2.4.1"></a>
#### 2.2.4.1 SQM Header

Every SQM session uploaded in the HTTP POST body MUST begin with a SQM session header.

The SQM section header describes the SQM section data [**BLOB**](#gt_binary-large-object-blob). The SQM section header is composed of two fields: a **SectionType** field and a **SectionLength** field.

**PropertyCount (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer specifying the number of Properties in the Property Set.

**PropertySetName (variable):** An array of bytes specifying a null-terminated [**Unicode string**](#gt_unicode-string) (16-bit character units). Each **PropertySetName** within a manifest MUST be unique.

The **PropertySetName** byte length is computed: **HeaderLength** – 0xC. The **PropertySetName** is aligned on an 8-byte boundary so it is possible for the byte length to be larger than the null-terminated Unicode string requires.

<a id="Section_2.2.6.6.2"></a>
##### 2.2.6.6.2 A-SQM Property

An A-SQM property is a key-value pair. Each key within the property set MUST be unique. The key-value is an SQM-enabled application-defined value. All key-value pairs are treated as null-terminated Unicode strings (16-bit character units).

The size of the property, in bytes, is computed: 0x8 + PropertyKeyLength + PropertyValueLength.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-31: "PropertyKeyLength"
  32-63: "PropertyValueLength"
  64-127: "PropertyKey"
  128-191: "PropertyValue"
```

**PropertyKeyLength (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer specifying the length of the **PropertyKey**, in bytes.

**PropertyValueLength (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer specifying the length of the **PropertyValue**, in bytes.

**PropertyKey (variable):** An array of bytes specifying a null-terminated [**Unicode string**](#gt_unicode-string) (16-bit character units). Each **PropertyKey** within the **PropertySet** MUST be unique.

The **PropertyKey** is aligned on an 8-byte boundary so it is possible for the byte length to be larger than the null-terminated Unicode string requires.

**PropertyValue (variable):** An array of bytes specifying a null-terminated Unicode string (16-bit character units).

The **PropertyValue** is aligned on an 8-byte boundary so it is possible for the byte length to be larger than the null-terminated Unicode string requires.

### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>
#### 3.1.5.1 Message Construction

The client constructs a data upload message as specified in section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2). Once the data is complete, the client prepares the data for upload.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1.1"></a>
##### 3.1.5.1.1 SQM Header Construction

The client creates a SQM header as specified in section [2.2.4.1](#Section_2.2.4.1). The client sets the **SQM Header** field values as specified in sections 2.2.4.1 and 3.1.5.1.1.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1.2"></a>
##### 3.1.5.1.2 Constructing SQM Sections

The client constructs a SQM section as follows:

- The client constructs the SQM sections as specified in section [2.2.4.2](#Section_2.2.4.2).
- The client computes the overall length (in bytes) of the SQM sections.
- The client computes a [**checksum**](#gt_checksum) of the SQM sections. The client and server SHOULD use the same checksum algorithm so that the server can validate the message stream.
- The client computes a count of the SQM sections.
<a id="Section_3.1.5.1.2.1"></a>
###### 3.1.5.1.2.1 SQM Session Upload Construction - Option 1 - Compressed

The client compresses the SQM section data as illustrated in Figure 3. The client computes the length of the compressed SQM section data and computes the [**checksum**](#gt_checksum) of the compressed SQM section data.

The client sets the values of the following SQM header fields, which are all specified in section [2.2.4.1](#Section_2.2.4.1).

- The **RawDataLength** field is set to the uncompressed SQM section data length value.
- The **RawDataChecksum** field is set to the uncompressed SQM section checksum value.
- The **DataLength** field is set to the compressed SQM section data length value.
- The **DataChecksum** field is set to the compressed SQM section data checksum value.
- Bit 0 in the **InternalFlags** field is set to 1**.**
- The **SectionCount** field is set to the section count value.
<a id="Section_3.1.5.1.2.2"></a>
###### 3.1.5.1.2.2 SQM Sections Upload Construction - Option 2 - Uncompressed

- The client sets the values of the following SQM header fields, which are all specified in section [2.2.4.1](#Section_2.2.4.1).
- The **DataLength** field is set to the uncompressed SQM section data length value.
- The **DataChecksum** field is set to the uncompressed SQM section [**checksum**](#gt_checksum) value.
- Bit 0 in the **InternalFlags** field is set to 0**.**
- The **SectionCount** field is set to the section count value.
<a id="Section_3.1.5.1.3"></a>
##### 3.1.5.1.3 Constructing the SQM Session

The client creates the SQM Session by joining the SQM header and the SQM section data (compressed or uncompressed) as illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2"></a>
#### 3.1.5.2 Message Data Upload Processing

The client creates a SQM data upload message consisting of one SQM session as described previously. The client MUST set the SQM header **ClientUploadTime** field to the client's current [**UTC**](#gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc) time as specified in section [2.2.4.2](#Section_2.2.4.2).

The message is sent to the SQM service by using HTTP/HTTPS POST specifying the SQM partner namespace, as specified in section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1). The entire message MUST be sent in one HTTP session.

The maximum POST body upload length is a well-known value contracted with the SQM service. This value MUST be known (see section 2.2.1).

- Upload length: The maximum POST body length (in bytes) as contracted with the SQM service for the SQM partner namespace (compressed or uncompressed). This value is enforced for any SQM upload.
- Precompressed length: The maximum pre-compression length for a compressed upload. This value is enforced for a compressed SQM upload.
A response message is returned in the HTTP status value and an additional response message MAY be returned in the HTTP header depending on the HTTP status value as specified in section [2.2.5](#Section_2.2.5) .

The client processes the response message based on the HTTP status code response described in sections [3.1.5.2.1](#Section_3.1.5.2.1) through [3.1.5.2.4](#Section_3.1.5.2.4).

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2.1"></a>
##### 3.1.5.2.1 HTTP 200 Status

This message is sent when the upload is complete and no additional action is necessary.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2.2"></a>
##### 3.1.5.2.2 HTTP 201 Status

The HTTP header has additional information as defined in section [2.2.5](#Section_2.2.5). The response message MUST contain a **ThrottleInterval** and/or **ManifestVersion** key-value pair as specified in section 2.2.5. The client proceeds as specified in section [3.1.5.3](#Section_3.1.5.3).

**ThrottleInterval:** ThrottleInterval indicates that the client SHOULD NOT send any data to the SQM service for the period specified in the ThrottleInternal message (section 2.2.5).

**ManifestVersion:** If the ManifestVersion value is not equal to the current client SQM manifest version, the client downloads an SQM manifest resource as described in section 3.1.5.3.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2.3"></a>
##### 3.1.5.2.3 HTTP 403 Status

The client SHOULD NOT send any data to the [**SQM service**](#gt_sqm-service) for a period of 14 days (see section [2.2.5](#Section_2.2.5)).

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2.4"></a>
##### 3.1.5.2.4 HTTP Status - Other

The client MAY retry the upload at a later time if an HTTP error status code (other than a 403 error status code described previously) is returned.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.3"></a>
#### 3.1.5.3 Processing an A-SQM Resource Message

Upon receipt of a **ManifestVersion** value as specified in section [3.1.5.2.2](#Section_3.1.5.2.2), the client compares the client's current manifest version value with the **ManifestVersion** value. If the two values are equal, the client takes no further action. If the two values are not equal, the client SHOULD<7> download the manifest version as described in section [3.1.5.3.1](#Section_3.1.5.3.1).

<a id="Section_3.1.5.3.1"></a>
##### 3.1.5.3.1 Downloading an A-SQM Resource

The client downloads an A-SQM resource by using HTTPS GET (see section [2.2.6](#Section_2.2.6)).<8> The client forms the GET request by using the SQM-enabled application's partner namespace. In the following example URL, this is represented as <SQM-PARTNER-NAMESPACE> and the **ManifestVersion** (<VERSION> in the example URL that follows) discovered in the HTTP 201 response, as specified in section [3.1.5.2.2](#Section_3.1.5.2.2).

The HTTP URL GET request form is as follows:

GET https://sqm.microsoft.com/sqm/<SQM-PARTNER-NAMESPACE>/manifests/Sqm<VERSION>.bin

The client downloads the A-SQM manifest resource and verifies the A-SQM manifest header **checksum** as specified in section [2.2.6.1](#Section_2.2.6.1). The client and server SHOULD<9> use the same checksum algorithm so that the server can validate the manifest.

The client makes this resource available to SQM-enabled applications based on the SQM partner namespace.

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The SQM session data upload is processed during the HTTP connection. The server MUST capture the HTTP POST body. The POST body contains the SQM session. The server processes the POST body as described in the following sections.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1"></a>
#### 3.2.5.1 Processing a Client Message SQM Header

The SQM header fields SHOULD be validated as specified in section [2.2.4.1](#Section_2.2.4.1) and described in section [3.1.5.1.1](#Section_3.1.5.1.1).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.2"></a>
#### 3.2.5.2 Processing SQM Section Data - Option 1 - Compressed

The server checks the SQM header **InternalFlags** field as specified in section [2.2.4.1](#Section_2.2.4.1). If bit 0 is set to 1, then the server processes the compressed data as follows:

- Verify the compressed SQM Section data length. The length MUST equal the length specified in the SQM header **DataLength** field.
- Verify the compressed SQM Section [**checksum**](#gt_checksum). The checksum MUST equal the value specified in the SQM header **DataChecksum** field.
- Decompress the SQM section data.
- Verify the uncompressed SQM Section data length. The length MUST equal the length specified in the SQM header **RawDataLength** field.
- Verify the uncompressed SQM Section data checksum. The checksum MUST equal the value specified in the SQM header **RawDataChecksum** field.
<a id="Section_3.2.5.3"></a>
#### 3.2.5.3 Processing SQM Section Data - Option 2 - Uncompressed

The server checks the SQM header **InternalFlags** field as specified in section [2.2.4.1](#Section_2.2.4.1). If bit 0 is set to 0, then the server processes the data as follows:

- Verify the SQM section data length. The length MUST equal the length specified in the SQM header **DataLength** field.
- Verify the SQM section [**checksum**](#gt_checksum). The checksum MUST equal the value specified in the SQM header **DataChecksum** field**.**
<a id="Section_3.2.5.4"></a>
#### 3.2.5.4 Processing the A-SQM Manifest Version Request

The server checks the SQM header **InternalFlags** field as specified in section [2.2.4.1](#Section_2.2.4.1). If bit 3 is set to 1 and the server manifest version is not equal to the SQM header **ClientVersion** field, then the server sends a manifest version response.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.5"></a>
#### 3.2.5.5 Sending a Client Response

The server sends one of the following responses to the client:

**Completion Response:** The server sends an HTTP 200 status response to the client if the message is processed and no action is requested from the client.

**Throttle Response:** The server sends an HTTP 201 status response to the client if the message is successfully processed and the server requests that the client halt further client-server SQM communication for the period (in days) as indicated in the value of the throttle key-value pair as specified in section [2.2.5](#Section_2.2.5). This response MAY be combined with an A-SQM manifest response.

**A-SQM Manifest Response:** The server sends an HTTP 201 status response to the client if the message is successfully processed and the client requests an A-SQM version update response as specified in section 2.2.5. This response MAY be combined with a throttle response.

**Fixed-Throttle Response:** The server sends an HTTP 403 Status response to the client if the server requests that the client halt further client-server SQM communication for 14 days.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.6"></a>
#### 3.2.5.6 A-SQM Manifest

The server allows the client to download the A-SQM manifest as specified in section [2.2.5](#Section_2.2.5) and described in section [3.1.5.3.1](#Section_3.1.5.3.1) using HTTP/HTTPS GET. The server resolves the HTTP/HTTPS GET URL to the physical A-SQM manifest.

<a id="Section_3.3"></a>
## 3.3 Proxy Details

This section specifies the proxy role in the SQM Client-to-Service Protocol.

When a configured [**SQM-enabled client**](#gt_sqm-enabled-client) sends a message to the proxy that contains SQM data, the proxy service opens the payload and adds a data point (see section [2.2.4.4.1](#Section_2.2.4.4.1.3)) identifying the proxy. The payload is then repackaged and sent to the SQM service. All messages that do not contain payload information are sent by the proxy from the SQM client to the SQM server with no modification.

![Client upload through a proxy server](media/image11.png)

Figure 11: Client upload through a proxy server

<a id="Section_3.3.1"></a>
### 3.3.1 Abstract Data Model

The SQM protocol relay transmits protocol messages on behalf of a client in environments where the client cannot access the SQM service directly (primarily where the client is protected by the firewall). To enable the relay, a client MUST be configured to send data to the relay service.

When a configured client sends a message to the relay that contains a SQM payload, the relay service opens the payload and adds a data point that identifies the relay<10>. This data is added to the SQM data point section of the payload as specified in section [2](#Section_2). The payload is then repackaged and set to the SQM service. If the proxy receives a message that does not fit the XML model for SQM, the message is forwarded directly to the SQM service, without modification. This enables support for A-SQM and SQM protocol message transmission.

<a id="Section_3.3.2"></a>
### 3.3.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.3.3"></a>
### 3.3.3 Initialization

The client MAY be configured manually to send SQM data to the relay.

<a id="Section_3.3.4"></a>
### 3.3.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.3.5"></a>
### 3.3.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The relay receives a SQM message from the client via an HTTP POST sent by using the proxy port configured on the SQM service. If the POST contains a payload that adheres to the SQM format, the message payload is augmented with an additional data point that identifies the relay. This is an additive change only. The payload is then repackaged and sent to the SQM service by using SSL over port 443.

All other protocol messages are directly sent directly through the proxy without modification in a similar manner, where the first transmission from the client to the relay is communicated over HTTP and the second transmission is communicated using over SSL by using port 443. If the proxy receives a message that is not of a recognized format, the message is sent to the SQM service with no changes.

<a id="Section_3.3.6"></a>

# 5 Security

<a id="Section_5.1"></a>
## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

HTTPS is the recommended transport mechanism when downloading an A-SQM manifest. Using HTTPS provides protection from [**man in the middle (MITM)**](#gt_man-in-the-middle-mitm) attacks, in which a private connection is controlled by an outside attacker, when the web server is trusted.

<a id="Section_5.2"></a>
## 5.2 Index of Security Parameters

None.

# 6 Appendix A: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental software. References to product versions include released service packs.

- Windows Vista operating system
- Windows Server 2008 operating system
- Windows 7 operating system
- Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system
- Windows 8 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 operating system
- Windows 8.1 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system
Exceptions, if any, are noted below. If a service pack or Quick Fix Engineering (QFE) number appears with the product version, behavior changed in that service pack or QFE. The new behavior also applies to subsequent service packs of the product unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 2.2.1: The Microsoft SQM client uses the following URL to communicate the SQM partner name to the SQM server.

http(s)://sqm.microsoft.com/sqm/%SQM-PARTNERNAME%/sqmserver.dll

where %SQM-PARTNERNAME% is replaced with the actual partner name. The SQM partner name is known to both the SQM client and the SQM server.

<2> Section 2.2.4.1: On Windows client implementations of SQM, the **Signature** value is set to 0x4D51534D.

<3> Section 2.2.4.1: Windows client implementations of SQM using the following **Flags** bit positions:

| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable | 0 | Debug SQM application |
| Variable | 1 | Reserved |
| Variable | 2 | SSL required for upload |
| Variable | 3 | Do not upload |
| Variable | 4 | Reserved |
| Variable | 5 | Reserved |
| Variable | 6 | Partial SQM session |
| Variable | 7 | SQM session from proxy |
| Variable | 8 | Reserved |
| Variable | 9 | SQM session end time indeterminate |
| Variable | 10 | SQM header only upload |

<4> Section 2.2.4.1: Windows client implementations of SQM use the following algorithm to set the **DataChecksum** value and the **RawDataChecksum** value.

DWORD Checksum = 0

FOR EACH BYTE b FROM SQM-Header.DataLength TO SQM-Header.ApplicationVersionLow

Checksum = (Checksum * 101) + b

END FOR

FOR EACH BYTE b IN SQM-Section-Data

Checksum = (Checksum * 101) + b

END FOR

RETURN Checksum

<5> Section 2.2.6.1: Microsoft SQM server implementations of A-SQM use the following algorithm to set the Checksum value:

DWORD Checksum = 0

FOR EACH BYTE b IN A-SQM Manifest Data

Checksum = (Checksum * 101) + b

END FOR

RETURN Checksum

<6> Section 2.2.6.3: Microsoft server implementations of A-SQM set the **Signature** value to 0x414D5153.

<7> Section 3.1.5.3: Windows client implementations of A-SQM are not available on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.

<8> Section 3.1.5.3.1: Windows client implementations of A-SQM download a package that the Microsoft SQM server creates. The package contains an A-SQM download header as specified in section [2.2.6.1](#Section_2.2.6.1) within a compressed DLL file.

The DLL file contains a single resource named "ADAPTIVESQMANIFEST" with a resource type of "ASQMMANIFEST". The A-SQM manifest as specified in section [2.2.6.2](#Section_2.2.6.2) is contained within this DLL resource.

The DLL file (uncompressed) is signed by Microsoft. The Windows client implementations verify the file signature. The signature is verified by the WinVerifyTrust function as described in [[MSDN-CAPI]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89964). The **ActionID** used is WINTRUST_ACTION_GENERIC_VERIFY_V2.

Windows implementations of A-SQM use cabinet compression as described in [[MSDN-CAB]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=226293).

<9> Section 3.1.5.3.1: The Microsoft implementation of A-SQM uses the URL to differentiate the SQM Partner A-SQM manifests. The URL form is:

http://sqm.microsoft.com/%SQM-PARTNERNAME%/manifests/sqm%MANIFESTVERSION%.bin

where %SQM-PARTNERNAME% is replaced with the actual partner name and %MANIFESTVERSION% is replaced with the **ManifestVersion** value, in decimal form, as specified in section [2.2.4.1](#Section_2.2.4.1), and section [3.1.5.2.2](#Section_3.1.5.2.2). The SQM partner name is known to the SQM client and the SQM server.

<10> Section 3.3.1: On Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, the proxy can be enabled by installing the Windows Feedback Forwarder. Windows Feedback Forwarder contains two settings. One setting configures the port number on which to receive SQM messages and the second setting configures proxy information so that the Windows Feedback Forwarder service can connect to the SQM service through a firewall. The Windows Feedback Forwarder service will not relay any messages unless a client is configured to send SQM data to the relay.
