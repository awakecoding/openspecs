# 1 Introduction

An industry trend has been developing in which employees connect their personal mobile computing devices to the corporate network and resources (either on premise or through the cloud) to perform workplace tasks. This trend requires support for easy configuration of the network and resources, such that employees can register personal devices with the company for work-related purposes. Applications and technology that support easy configuration also enable IT professionals to manage the risk associated with having uncontrolled devices connected to the corporate network.

The Mobile Device Management Protocol (MDM) [MS-MDM](../MS-MDM/MS-MDM.md) specifies a protocol for managing devices through a Device Management Service (DMS). This document describes Version 2 of the Mobile Device Enrollment Protocol (MDE), which enables enrolling a device with the DMS through an Enrollment Service (ES). The protocol includes the discovery of the Management Enrollment Service (MES) and enrollment with the ES.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_azure-active-directory-azure-ad"></a>
**Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**: The identity service in Microsoft Azure that provides identity management and access control capabilities through a REST-based API, an Azure portal, or a PowerShell command window.

<a id="gt_base64-encoding"></a>
**base64 encoding**: A binary-to-text encoding scheme whereby an arbitrary sequence of bytes is converted to a sequence of printable ASCII characters, as described in [[RFC4648]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90487).

<a id="gt_certificate"></a>
**certificate**: A certificate is a collection of attributes and extensions that can be stored persistently. The set of attributes in a certificate can vary depending on the intended usage of the certificate. A certificate securely binds a public key to the entity that holds the corresponding private key. A certificate is commonly used for authentication and secure exchange of information on open networks, such as the Internet, extranets, and intranets. Certificates are digitally signed by the issuing [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) and can be issued for a user, a computer, or a service. The most widely accepted format for certificates is defined by the ITU-T X.509 version 3 international standards. For more information about attributes and extensions, see [[RFC3280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90414) and [[X509]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90590) sections 7 and 8.

<a id="gt_certificate-attestation"></a>
**certificate attestation**: The process of attesting that the private key for the MDM certificate is properly protected by the TPM or other such protection method. This behavior is only available with enrollment version 5.0.

<a id="gt_certificate-enrollment"></a>
**certificate enrollment**: The process of acquiring a digital certificate from a [**certificate authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca), which typically requires an end entity to first makes itself known to the CA (either directly, or through a registration authority). This certificate and its associated [**private key**](#gt_private-key) establish a trusted identity for an entity that is using the [**public key**](#gt_public-key)–based services and applications. Also referred to as simply "enrollment".

<a id="gt_certificate-enrollment-policy"></a>
**certificate enrollment policy**: The collection of [**certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template) and [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) issuers available to the requestor for [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificate enrollment**](#gt_certificate-enrollment).

<a id="gt_certificate-policy"></a>
**certificate policy**: A document that identifies the actors of a public key infrastructure (PKI), along with their roles and tasks.

<a id="gt_certificate-signing-request"></a>
**certificate signing request**: In a public key infrastructure (PKI) configuration, a request message sent from a requestor to a certification authority (CA) to apply for a digital identity certificate.

<a id="gt_certificate-template"></a>
**certificate template**: A list of attributes that define a blueprint for creating an [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificate**](#gt_certificate). It is often referred to in non-Microsoft documentation as a "certificate profile". A [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template) is used to define the content and purpose of a digital certificate, including issuance requirements (certificate policies), implemented [**X.509**](#gt_x509) extensions such as application policies, key usage, or extended key usage as specified in [X509], and enrollment permissions. Enrollment permissions define the rules by which a [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) will issue or deny certificate requests. In Windows environments, [**certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template) are stored as objects in the Active Directory and used by Microsoft enterprise [**CAs**](#gt_certification-authority-ca).

<a id="gt_certification-authority-ca"></a>
**certification authority (CA)**: A third party that issues [**public key**](#gt_public-key) [**certificates**](#gt_certificate). Certificates serve to bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide whether to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust is to be transitive. For more information, see [RFC3280].

<a id="gt_client"></a>

**XML namespace**: A collection of names that is used to identify elements, types, and attributes in XML documents identified in a URI reference [[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453). A combination of XML namespace and local name allows XML documents to use elements, types, and attributes that have the same names but come from different sources. For more information, see [[XMLNS-2ED]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90602).

<a id="gt_xml-path-language-xpath"></a>
**XML Path Language (XPath)**: A language used to create expressions that can address parts of an XML document, manipulate strings, numbers, and Booleans, and can match a set of nodes in the document, as specified in [XPATH]. XPath models an XML document as a tree of nodes of different types, including element, attribute, and text. XPath expressions can identify the nodes in an XML document based on their type, name, and values, as well as the relationship of a node to other nodes in the document.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

**The Mobile Device Enrollment (**MDE) protocol enables a device to be enrolled with a [**Device Management Service (DMS)**](#gt_device-management-service-dms) through an [**Enrollment Service (ES)**](#gt_enrollment-service-es), including the discovery of the [**Management Enrollment Service (MES)**](#gt_management-enrollment-service-mes) and enrollment with the ES. After a device is enrolled, the device can be managed with the DMS using MDM.

The process for enrolling a device using MDE2 is shown in the following diagram.

![Typical sequence for enrolling a message using MDE2](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Typical sequence for enrolling a message using MDE2

The enrollment process consists of the following steps.

- The user’s email name is entered via the [**enrollment client**](#gt_enrollment-client).
- The enrollment client extracts the domain suffix from the email address, prepends the domain name with a well-known label, and resolves the address to the [**Discovery Service (DS)**](#gt_discovery-service-ds). The administrator configures the network name resolution service (that is, the [**Domain Name System (DNS)**](#gt_domain-name-system-dns)) appropriately.
- The enrollment client sends an [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http) GET request to the Discovery Service to validate the existence of the [**service endpoint**](#gt_service-endpoint).
- The enrollment client sends a **Discover** message (section [3.1.4.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.4.1.1.1)) to the Discovery Service. The Discovery Service responds with a **DiscoverResponse** message (section [3.1.4.1.1.2](#Section_3.1.4.1.1.2)) containing the Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) of service endpoints required for the following steps.
- The enrollment client communicates with the [**security token service (STS)**](#gt_security-token-service-sts) (section [3.2](#Section_3.2)) to obtain a [**security token**](#gt_security-token) to authenticate with the ES.
- The enrollment client sends a **GetPolicies** message (section [3.3.4.1.1.1](#Section_3.3.4.1.1.1)) the [**ES endpoint**](#gt_es-endpoint) [MS-XCEP](../MS-XCEP/MS-XCEP.md) using the security token received in the previous step. The ES endpoint [MS-XCEP] responds with a **GetPoliciesResponse** message (section [3.3.4.1.1.2](#Section_3.3.4.1.1.2)) containing the [**certificate policies**](#gt_certificate-policy) required for the next step. For more information about these messages, see [MS-XCEP] sections 3.1.4.1.1.1 and 3.1.4.1.1.2.
- The enrollment client can send a **RequestSecurityToken** message (section [3.4.4.1.1.1](#Section_3.4.4.1.1.1)) to the ES endpoint [MS-WSTEP](../MS-WSTEP/MS-WSTEP.md) using the security token received in step 5. The ES endpoint [MS-WSTEP] responds with a **RequestSecurityTokenResponseCollection** message (section [3.4.4.1.1.2](#Section_3.4.4.1.1.2)) containing the identity and [**provisioning information**](#gt_provisioning-information) for the [**device management client**](#gt_device-management-client) [MS-MDM](../MS-MDM/MS-MDM.md). For more information about these messages, see [MS-WSTEP] sections 3.1.4.1.1.1 and 3.1.4.1.1.2.
The steps for MDE2 device enrollment correspond to five phases as shown in the following diagram.

![MDE2 device enrollment phases](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: MDE2 device enrollment phases

For Mobile Application Management (MAM), the server skips the discover, get security token, and get policies phases and goes straight to the request security token phase (see MAM product notes section [2.2.9.1](#Section_2.2.9.1) and section [2.2.9.5](#Section_2.2.9.5)). For more information on MAM, see [[MSDN-WinMAM]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=842818).

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

MDE2 depends on the WS-Trust X.509v3 Token Enrollment Extensions [MS-WSTEP](../MS-WSTEP/MS-WSTEP.md).

MDE2 depends on the X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy Protocol [MS-XCEP](../MS-XCEP/MS-XCEP.md).

The Mobile Device Management Protocol (MDM) depends on MDE2. A device has to be enrolled in an [**MES**](#gt_management-enrollment-service-mes) through the use of MDE2 before the device can be managed using MDM [MS-MDM](../MS-MDM/MS-MDM.md).

![Relationship to other protocols](media/image3.png)

Figure 3: Relationship to other protocols

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

MDE2 issues X.509v3 [MS-WSTEP](../MS-WSTEP/MS-WSTEP.md) certificates and [**provisioning information**](#gt_provisioning-information) for [**device management clients**](#gt_device-management-client) [MS-MDM](../MS-MDM/MS-MDM.md) to enable a relationship between the user and a device in the [**DMS**](#gt_digital-media-server-dms).

The MES issues a [**security token**](#gt_security-token) (after appropriate authentication) that is used to authenticate to the [**ES**](#gt_enrollment-service-es).

The ES communicates with a [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) to issue an [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificate**](#gt_certificate).

The ES issues provisioning information for a device management client [MS-MDM]. The ES has to be configured with this information or be able to retrieve it from the DMS.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

A device has to be enrolled in an [**MES**](#gt_management-enrollment-service-mes) through the use of MDE2 before the device can be managed using MDM [MS-MDM](../MS-MDM/MS-MDM.md).

## 2.1 Transport

MDE2 is a client-to-server protocol that consists of a SOAP-based Web service.

MDE2 operates over the following [**Web services**](#gt_web-service) transport:

- SOAP 1.1 ([[SOAP1.1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90520), [[SOAP1.1-Envelope]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=111315)) over HTTPS over [**TCP**](#gt_transmission-control-protocol-tcp)/IP [[RFC2616]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90372)
<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Common Message Syntax

This section contains common definitions used by this protocol. The syntax of the definitions uses the XML Schema as defined in [[XMLSCHEMA1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90608) and [[XMLSCHEMA2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90610), and the [**Web Services Description Language (WSDL)**](#gt_web-services-description-language-wsdl) as defined in [[WSDL]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90577).

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Namespaces

This specification defines and references various [**XML namespaces**](#gt_xml-namespace) using the mechanisms specified in [[XMLNS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=191840). Although this specification associates a specific XML namespace prefix for each XML namespace that is used, the choice of any specific XML namespace prefix is implementation-specific and not significant for interoperability.

#### 2.2.9.2 CertificateStore Configuration Service Provider

The CertificateStore configuration service provider is used to add [**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**](#gt_secure-sockets-layer-ssl), intermediate, and self-signed [**certificates**](#gt_certificate).

**Note**: The CertificateStore configuration service provider does not support installing [**client**](#gt_client) certificates.

**Note**: For the CertificateStore CSP, the Replace command cannot be used unless the node already exists.

The following diagram shows the CertificateStore configuration service provider management object in tree format.

![The CertificateStore configuration service provider management object in tree format](media/image4.png)

**CA/System:** Defines the certificate store that contains cryptographic information, including intermediary certification authorities. Supported operation is **Get**. Note that CA/System is case sensitive.

**My/User:** Defines the certificate store that contains public keys for client certificates. This is only used by enterprise servers to push down the public key of a client certificate. The client certificate is used by the device client to authenticate itself to the enterprise server for device management and downloading enterprise applications. Supported operation is **Get**. Note that My/User is case sensitive.

**My/System:** Defines the certificate store that contains the [**public key**](#gt_public-key) for the client certificate. This is only used by enterprise server to push down the public key of the client certificate. The client certificate is used by the device to authenticate itself to the enterprise server for device management and enterprise app downloading. Supported operation is **Get**. Note that My/System is case sensitive.

**[CertHash]:** Defines the [**SHA-1 hash**](#gt_sha-1-hash) for the certificate. The 20-byte value of the [**SHA-1**](#gt_sha-1) certificate [**hash**](#gt_hash) is specified as a hexadecimal string value. Supported operations are **Get**, **Delete**, and **Replace**.

**My/SCEP/[UniqueID]/Install/TemplateName:** Optional. OID of certificate template name. Note that this name is typically ignored by the SCEP server; therefore, the MDM server typically does not need to provide it. Value type is chr. Supported operations are **Add**, **Get**, and **Delete**.

**My/SCEP/[UniqueID]/Install/KeyLength:** Required for enrollment. Specifies private key length (RSA). Value type is int. Valid values are 1024, 2048, 4096<2>. Supported operations are **Add**, **Delete**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

**My/SCEP/[UniqueID]/Install/HashAlgorithm:** Required for enrollment. Hash algorithm family (SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3) specified by the MDM server. If multiple hash algorithm families are specified, they MUST be separated with a +. Value type is chr. Supported operations are **Add**, **Delete**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

**My/SCEP/[UniqueID]/Install/CAThumbprint:** Required. Specifies the root CA thumbprint. It is a 20-byte value of the SHA-1 certificate hash specified as a hexadecimal string value. When a client authenticates a SCEP server, it checks the CA certificate from the SCEP server for a match with this certificate. If it does not match, the authentication fails. Value type is chr. Supported operations are **Add**, **Delete**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

**My/SCEP/[UniqueID]/Install/SubjectAlternativeNames:** Optional. Specifies the subject alternative name. Multiple alternative names can be specified. Each name is the combination of name format+actual name. For more information on the name type definition see [[MSDOCS-ClientCertInstall-CSP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2191842). Each pair is separated by semicolon. For example, multiple subject alternative names are presented in the format <nameformat1>+<actual name1>;<name format 2>+<actual name2>. Value type is chr. Supported operations are **Add**, **Delete**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

**My/SCEP/[UniqueID]/Install/ValidPeriod:** Optional. Specifies the units for valid period. Valid values are Days (Default), Months, Years. Value type is chr. Supported operations are **Add**, **Delete**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

**Note:** The device only sends the MDM server expected certificate validation period (ValidPeriodUnits + ValidPeriod) of the SCEP server as part of certificate enrollment request. How this valid period is used to create the certificate depends on the MDM server.

**My/SCEP/[UniqueID]/Install/ValidPeriodUnits:** Optional. Specifies desired number of units used in validity period and subject to SCEP server configuration. Default is 0. The units are defined in ValidPeriod node. The valid period specified by MDM overwrites the valid period specified in the certificate template. For example, if ValidPeriod is days and ValidPeriodUnits is 30, it means the total valid duration is 30 days. Value type is int. Supported operations are **Add**, **Delete**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

**Note:** The device only sends the MDM server expected certificate validation period (ValidPeriodUnits + ValidPeriod) of the SCEP server as part of certificate enrollment request. How this valid period is used to create the certificate depends on the MDM server.

**My/SCEP/[UniqueID]/Install/Enroll:** Required. Triggers the device to start the certificate enrollment. The MDM server can later query the device to find out whether the new certificate is added. Value type is null, which means that this node does not contain a value. Supported operation is **Exec**.

**My/WSTEP:** Required for MDM enrolled device. The parent node that hosts the MDM enrollment client certificate related settings that is enrolled via WSTEP. The nodes under WSTEP are mostly for MDM client certificate renew requests. Value type is node. Supported operation is **Get**.

**My/WSTEP/Renew:** Optional. The parent node to group renewal related settings. Supported operation is **Get**.

**My/WSTEP/Renew/ServerURL:** Optional. Specifies the URL of certificate renewal server. If this node does not exist, the client uses the initial discovery URL from enrollment. Supported operations are **Add**, **Delete**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

**My/WSTEP/Renew/RenewalPeriod:** Optional. The time (in days) to trigger the client to initiate the MDM client certificate renew process before the MDM certificate expires. The MDM server cannot set and update the certificate expiration date. It is recommended that the renew period is set a couple months before the certificate expires to ensure that the certificate gets renewed successfully with data connectivity.

The default value is 42 and the valid values are 1 – 1000. Value type is int. Supported operations are **Add**, **Delete**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

**Note:** When the renewal schedule is set over SyncML DM commands to ROBOSupport, RenewalPeriod, and RetryInterval, it MUST be wrapped in **Atomic** commands as specified in [MS-MDM](../MS-MDM/MS-MDM.md).

**My/WSTEP/Renew/RetryInterval:** Optional. Specifies the retry interval (in days) when the previous renewal failed. The retry schedule stops at the certificate expiration date.

The default value is 7 and the valid values are 1 – 1000 AND =< RenewalPeriod, otherwise it will result in error.. Value type is int. Supported operations are **Add**, **Delete**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

#### 2.2.9.3 DMClient Configuration Service Provider

The DMClient configuration service provider is used to specify additional enterprise-specific mobile device management configuration settings for identifying the device in the enterprise domain, security mitigation for [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) renewal, and server-triggered enterprise unenrollment.

The following diagram shows the DMClient configuration service provider in tree format.

![The DMClient configuration service provider in tree format](media/image7.png)

![The DMClient configuration service provider in tree format](media/image8.png)

Figure 5: The DMClient configuration service provider in tree format

**DMClient:** Root node for the CSP.

**UpdateManagementServiceAddress:** For provisioning packages only. Specifies the semicolon-delimited list of servers. The first server in the list is the server that will be used to instantiate MDM sessions. The list can be a permutation or a subset of the existing server list. New servers cannot be added to the list using this node

**Provider:** Required. The root node for all settings that belong to a single management server. Scope is permanent. Supported operation is **Get**.

***ProviderID*:** Optional. This node contains the URI-encoded value of the bootstrapped device management account's Provider ID. Scope is dynamic. As a best practice, use text that doesn't require XML/URI escaping. Supported operations are **Add** and **Get**.

***ProviderID*/EntDeviceName:** Optional. The character string that contains the user-friendly device name used by the IT admin console. The value is set during the enrollment process by way of the DMClient configuration service provider. It can be retrieved later during an [**OMA DM**](#gt_d6471a40-dc75-4bb9-9ff3-003dc318cf31) session. Supported operations are **Add** and **Get**.

***ProviderID*/EntDMID:** Optional. The character string that contains the unique enterprise device ID. The value is set by the management server during the enrollment process by way of the DMClient configuration service provider. It can be retrieved later during an OMA DM session. Supported operations are **Add** and **Get**.

Although hardware device IDs are guaranteed to be unique, there is a concern that this is not ultimately enforceable during a DM session. The device ID could be changed through the w7 APPLICATION configuration service provider's USEHWDEVID parmeter by another management server. So during enterprise bootstrap and enrollment, a new device ID is specified by the enterprise server.

This node is required and MUST be set by the server before the client certificate renewal is triggered.

***ProviderID*/ExchangeID:** Optional. The character string that contains the unique Exchange device ID used by the Outlook account. This is useful for the enterprise management server to correlate and merge records for a device that is managed by exchange and natively managed by a dedicated management server. Supported operation is **Get**. The following is a **Get** command sample. Implementers MUST replace "TestMDMServer" with the actual name of the configured Provider ID. The **ExchangeID** is per user and for [**Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**](#gt_azure-active-directory-azure-ad) enrollments the value depends on the logged in user.

<Get>

<Item>

<Target>

<LocURI>./Vendor/MSFT/DMClient/<*ProviderID*>/TestMDMServer/ExchangeID</LocURI>

</Target>

</Item>

</Get>

***ProviderID/*LinkedEnrollment/Enroll:** The LinkedEnrollment/Enroll command will trigger an enrollment in a Declared Configuration environment. This is an enrollment type that exists side-by-side with the existing enrollment, and which provides instruction to the device using the Declared Configuration format. This uses the device token from the device which MUST be joined to Azure AD. Supported operation is **Exec**.<4>

***ProviderID*/LinkedEnrollment/UnEnroll:** The LinkedEnrollment/Unenroll command will trigger a silent unenrollment from a side-by-side Declared Configuration environment. When the device is unenrolled all settings and resources provisioned by the Declared Configuration environment MUST be rolled back or removed. Supported operation is **Exec**.<5>

***ProviderID/*LinkedEnrollment/EnrollStatus:** Required. LinkedEnrollment/EnrollStatus is an integer value used to check whether a device has a linked enrollment in a Declared Configuration environment. The value MUST be one of those in the following table.<6>

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Undefined | 0 |
| NotStarted | 1 |
| InProgress | 2 |
| Failed | 3 |
| Succeeded | 4 |

***ProviderID/*LinkedEnrollment/LastError:** Optional. The integer value that indicates the HRESULT of the last enrollment error code. Supported operation is **Get**.<7>

***ProviderID/*LinkedEnrollment/DiscoveryEndpoint:** Optional. The DiscoveryEndpoint is a URL that indicates the location of a specific discovery service (section [3.1](#Section_3.1)). If present, the value indicates the discovery service that is used to create a linked Declared Configuration enrollment. If the value is not present, then the client will return an empty string. Supported operations are **Set**, **Get**, and **Delete**.**<8>**

The following is an example of the SyncML for setting the discovery endpoint for LinkedEnrollment/Enroll:

</Item>

</Exec>

<Final/>

</SyncBody>

</SyncML>

***ProviderID*/PublisherDeviceID:** (Only for phones). Optional. The **PublisherDeviceID** is a device-unique ID created based on the enterprise Publisher ID. Publisher ID is created based on the enterprise application token and enterprise ID via ./Vendor/MSFT/EnterpriseAppManagement/<enterprise id>/EnrollmentToken. It is to ensure that for one enterprise, each device has a unique ID associated with it. For the same device, if it has multiple enterprises' applications, each enterprise is identified differently. Supported operation is **Get**.

***ProviderID*/SignedEntDMID:** Optional. The character string that contains the device ID. This node and the nodes **CertRenewTimeStamp** and **SignedCertRenewStamp** can be used by the mobile device management server to verify client identity in order to update the registration record after the device certificate is renewed. The device signs the EntDMID with the old client certificate during the certificate renewal process and saves the signature locally. Supported operation is **Get**.

***ProviderID*/CertRenewTimeStamp:** Optional. The time in OMA DM standard time format. This node and the **SignedCertRenewTimeStamp** node are designed to reduce the risk of the certificate being used by another device. The device records the time that the new certificate was created. Supported operation is **Get**.

***ProviderID/*ManagementServiceAddress:** Required. The character string that contains the device management server address. It can be updated during an OMA DM session by the management server to allow the server to load balance to another server in situations where too many devices are connected to the server.

The DMClient configuration service provider saves the address to the same location used by the w7 and DMS configuration service providers, to ensure that the management client has a single place to retrieve the current server address.

The initial value for this node is the same server address value that is bootstrapped via the w7 APPLICATION configuration service provider. Supported operations are **Get** and **Replace**.

This node supports multiple server addresses in the format <URL1><URL2><URL3><9>. If there is only a single URL, then the angle brackets are not required. This is supported for both desktop and mobile devices.

During a DM session, the device will use the first address on the list, and then process the list until a successful connection is achieved. The DM client caches the successfully connected server URL for the next session.

***ProviderID/*UPN:** Optional. Allows the management server to update the [**user principal name (UPN)**](#gt_user-principal-name-upn) of the enrolled user. This is useful in scenarios where the user email address changes in the identity system, or in the scenario where the user enters an invalid UPN during enrollment, and fixes the UPN during federated authentication. The UPN is recorded and the UX displays the updated UPN. Supported operations are **Delete**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

***ProviderID/*HelpPhoneNumber:** Optional. A character string value that contains the customized help phone number that the end user can use if they need help or support. Supported operations are **Get**, **Replace**, and **Delete**.

***ProviderID/*HelpWebsite:** Optional. A character string value that contains the customized help website that the end user can use if they need help or support. Supported operations are **Delete**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

***ProviderID/*HelpEmailAddress:** Optional. A character string value that contains the customized help email address that the end user can use if they need help or support. Supported operations are **Get**, **Replace**, and **Delete**.

***ProviderID*/RequireMessageSigning:** Optional. Boolean type. Primarily used for [**SSL**](#gt_secure-sockets-layer-ssl) bridging mode where firewalls and proxies are deployed and where device client identity is required. When enabled, every SyncML message from the device will carry an additional HTTP header named MDM-Signature. This header contains [**Base64**](#gt_179b9392-9019-45a3-880b-26f6890522b7)-encoded Cryptographic Message Syntax using a Detached Signature of the complete SyncML message SHA-2 (inclusive of the SyncHdr and SyncBody tags). Signing is performed using the private key of the management session certificate that was enrolled as part of the MDE2 enrollment process. The device's public key and PKCS9 [**UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)**](#gt_utc-coordinated-universal-time) signing time stamp are included as part of the authenticated attributes in the signature. For more information on PKCS9 see [[RFC2985]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90400).

The default value is false, where the device management client does not include authentication information in the management session HTTP header. Optionally set to true, where client authentication information is provided in the management session HTTP header.

When enabled, the MDM server validates the signature and the timestamp using the device identify certificate enrolled as part of MDE2, ensure the certificate and time are valid, and verify that the signature is trusted by the MDM server. Supported operations are **Delete**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

***ProviderID/*SyncApplicationVersion:** Optional. Allows the management server to set the maximum current version of the management session protocol. A management server can update this if it detects a newer **MaxSyncApplicationVersion** that the client and server support. All changes to the **MaxSyncApplicationVersion** go into effect on the next session. Supported operations are **Add** and **Get**. Once this value is set to 2.0, it cannot be re-set to 1.0.

***ProviderID/*MaxSyncApplicationVersion:** Optional. Returns a character string that is the highest supported management session protocol version supported by the current platform. Supported operation is **Get**.

***ProviderID/*AADResourceID:** Optional. This is the ResourceID used when requesting the user token from the OMA DM session for Azure AD enrollments (AAD Join or Add Accounts). The token is audience specific, which allows for different service principals (enrollment vs. device management). It can be an application ID or the endpoint that you are trying to access.

***ProviderID/*EnableOmaDmKeepAliveMessage:** A boolean value that specifies whether the DM client sends a request pending alert if the device client response to a DM request is too slow. By default, the MDM client does not send an alert that a DM request is pending.<10>

When the server sends a configuration request, sometimes it takes the client longer than the HTTP timeout to get all information together and then the session ends unexpectedly due to timeout

To work around the timeout, this setting can be used to keep the session alive by sending a heartbeat message back to the server. This is achieved by sending a SyncML message with a specific device alert element in the body until the client can respond back to the server with the requested information.

Here is an example of DM message sent by the device when it is in pending state.

***ProviderID/*AADDeviceID:** Returns the device ID for the Azure Active Directory device registration. Supported operation is **Get**.<11>

***ProviderID/*EnrollmentType:** Returns the enrollment type (Device, Full, or AppManagement). Supported operation is **Get**.<12>

***ProviderID/*HWDevID:** Returns the hardware device ID. Supported operation is **Get**.<13>

***ProviderID/*CommercialID:** Configures the identifier used to uniquely associate this telemetry data of this device as belonging to a given organization. <14> If your organization is participating in a program that requires this device to be identified as belonging to your organization then use this setting to provide that identification. The value for this setting will be provided by Microsoft as part of the onboarding process for the program. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, then Microsoft will not be able to use this identifier to associate this machine and its telemetry data with your organization. Supported operations are **Add**, **Delete**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

***ProviderID/*ManagementServerAddressList:** The list of management server URLs in the format <URL1<URL2><URL3>, etc.<15> If there is only one, the angle brackets (<>) are not required. Not that the < and > should be escaped.

If ManagementServerAddressList node is set, the device will only use the server URL configured in this node.

When the server is not responding after a specified number of retries, the device tries to use the next server URL in the list until it gets a successful connection. After the server list is updated, the client uses the updated list at the next session starting with the first on in the list. Supported operations are **Get** and **Replace**. Value type is string.

***ProviderID*/Poll:** Optional. Polling schedules MUST utilize the DMClient CSP, see [[MSDOCS-DMClient-CSP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2161995). Supported operations are **Add** and **Get**.

There are three schedules managed under the Poll node which enable a rich polling schedule experience to provide greater flexibility in managing the way in which devices poll the management server. There are a variety of ways in which polling schedules are set. If an invalid polling configuration is set, the device will correct or remove the schedules in order to restore the polling schedules back to a valid configuration.

If there is no infinite schedule set, then a 24-hour schedule is created and scheduled to launch in the maintenance window.

**Valid poll schedule: sigmoid polling schedule with infinite schedule (Recommended)**

If the device was previously enrolled in MDM with a polling schedule directly configured via registry key values the MDM server that supports using DMClient CSP to update polling schedule sends an **Add** command to add a ./Vendor/MSFT/DMClient/Enrollment/<ProviderID>/Poll node before it sends a **Get** or **Replace** command to query or update polling parameters via DMClient CSP. When using the DMClient CSP to configure polling schedule parameters, the server MUST NOT set all 6 polling parameters to 0 and MUST NOT set all 3 number of retries nodes to 0 because it will cause a configuration failure.

***ProviderID*/Poll/IntervalForFirstSetOfRetries:** Optional. The waiting time (in minutes) for the initial set of retries as specified by the number of retries in <ProviderID>/Poll/**NumberOfFirstRetries**. If **IntervalForFirstSetOfRetries** is not set, then the default value is used. The default value is 15. If the value is set to 0, this schedule is disabled. The supported operations are **Get** and **Replace**.

***ProviderID*/Poll/NumberOfFirstRetries:** Optional. The number of times the [**device management client**](#gt_device-management-client) can retry to connect to the server when the client is initially configured or enrolled to communicate with the server. If the value is set to 0 and the **IntervalForFirstSetOfRetries** value is not 0, then the schedule will be set to repeat an infinite number of times and second set will not set in this case. The default value is 10. The supported operations are **Get** and **Replace**.

The first set of retries is intended to give the management server some buffered time to be ready to send policies and settings configuration to the device. It is best practice to not have the first set of retries go beyond a few hours. The server MUST NOT set NumberOfFirstRetries to 0. RemainingScheduledRetries is used for the long run device polling schedule.

***ProviderID*/Poll/IntervalForSecondSetOfRetries:** Optional. The waiting time (in minutes) for the second set of retries as specified by the number of retries in /<ProviderID>/Poll/NumberOfSecondRetries. Default value is 0. If this value is set to zero, then this schedule is disabled. The supported operations are **Get** and **Replace**.

***ProviderID*/Poll/NumberOfSecondRetries:** Optional. The number of times the device management client can retry a second round of connecting to the server when the client is initially configured/enrolled to communicate with the server. Default value is 0. If the value is set to 0 and **IntervalForSecondSetOfRetries** is not set to 0 AND the first set of retries is not set as infinite retries, then the schedule repeats an infinite number of times. However, if the first set of retries is set at infinite, then this schedule is disabled. Supported operations are **Get** and **Replace**.

**IntervalForSecondSetOfRetries** SHOULD be longer than **IntervalForFirstSetOfRetries**. The total duration of retries can be more than 24 hours. **RemainingScheduledRetries** is used for the long run device polling schedule.

***ProviderID*/Poll/IntervalForRemainingScheduledRetries:** Optional. The waiting time (in minutes) for the initial set of retries as specified by the number of retries in /<ProviderID>/Poll/NumberOfRemainingScheduledRetries. Default value is 0. If IntervalForRemainingScheduledRetries is set to 0, then this schedule is disabled. Supported operations are **Get** and **Replace**.

The **IntervalForRemainingScheduledRetries** replaces the deprecated HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Enrollment\OmaDmRetry\Aux2RetryInterval path that previously utilized the Registry CSP.

***ProviderID*/Poll/NumberOfRemainingScheduledRetries:** Optional. The number of times the device management client can retry connecting to the server when the client is initially configured/enrolled to communicate with the server. Default value is 0. If the value is set to 0 and **IntervalForRemainingScheduledRetries** AND the first and second set of retries are not set as infinite retries, then the schedule will be set to repeat for an infinite number of times. However, if either or both of the first and second set of retries are set as infinite, then this schedule will be disabled. Supported operations are **Get** and **Replace**.

The **NumberOfRemainingScheduledRetries** replaces the deprecated HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Enrollment\OmaDmRetry\Aux2NumRetries path that previously utilized the Registry CSP.

**RemainingScheduledRetries** is used for the long run device polling schedule. IntervalForRemainingScheduledRetries MUST NOT be smaller than 1440 minutes (24 hours).

***ProviderID*/Poll/PollOnLogin:** Optional. Allows the IT admin to require the device to start a management session on any user login, regardless of whether the user has previously logged in. Login is not the same as device unlock. Default value is false, where polling is disabled on first login. Supported values are true or false. Supported operations are **Add**, **Get** and **Replace**.

***ProviderID*/Poll/AllUsersPollOnFirstLogin:** Optional. Allows the IT admin to require the device to start a management session on first user login for all NT users. A session is only kicked off the first time a user logs in to the system; subsequent logins will not trigger an MDM session. Login is not the same as device unlock. Default value is false, where polling is disabled on first login. Supported values are true or false. Supported operations are **Add**, **Get** and **Replace**.

***ProviderID*/Push:** Optional. Not configurable during Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Provisioning XML ([[WBXML1.2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=160492)). If removed, DM sessions triggered by Push will no longer be supported. Supported operations are **Add** and **Delete**.

***ProviderID*/Push/PFN:** Required. The Package Family Name (**PFN**) is a string used to register a device for push notifications. The server MUST use the same **PFN** as the devices it is managing. Supported operations are **Add**, **Get**, and **Replace**.

***ProviderID*/Push/ChannelURI:** Required. A string that contains the channel that the [**Windows Notification Service (WNS)**](#gt_windows-notification-service-wns) client has negotiated for the OMA DM client on the device based on the **PFN** that was provided. If no valid **PFN** is currently set, **ChannelURI** will return null. Supported operation is **Get**.

***ProviderID*/Push/Status:** Required. An integer that maps to a known error state or condition on the system. The status error mapping is listed below. Supported operation is **Get**.

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Success! |
| 1 | Failure: invalid PFN |
| 2 | Failure: invalid or expired device authentication with MSA (MS Account) |
| 3 | Failure: WNS client registration failed due to an invalid or revoked PFN |
| 4 | Failure: no Channel URI assigned |
| 5 | Failure: Channel URI has expired |
| 6 | Failure: Channel URI failed to be revoked |
| 7 | Failure: Push notification received, but unable to establish an OMA DM session due to power or connectivity limitations. |
| 8 | Push Not Available On the SKU |

***ProviderID*/Unenroll:** Required. The node accepts unenrollment requests by way of the OMA DM **Exec** command and calls the enrollment client to unenroll the device from the management server whose provider ID is specified in the <Data> tag under the <Item> element. Scope is permanent. Supported operations are **Get** and **Exec**.

**Note:** <LocURI>/Vendor/MSFT/DMClient/Unenroll</LocURI> is supported for backward compatibility.

The following SyncML shows how to remotely unenroll the device. Note that this command can be inserted in the general DM packages sent from the server to the device.

#### 2.2.9.5 w7 APPLICATION Configuration Service Provider

The APPLICATION configuration service provider that has an APPID of w7 is used for bootstrapping a device with an [**OMA DM**](#gt_d6471a40-dc75-4bb9-9ff3-003dc318cf31) account. Although this configuration service provider is used to set up an OMA DM account, it is managed over OMA Client Provisioning.

**Note:** All parameter names and characteristic types are case sensitive and MUST use all uppercase. Both APPSRV and CLIENT credentials MUST be provided in the provisioning XML.

The following diagram shows the w7 APPLICATION configuration service provider in tree format.

![The w7 APPLICATION configuration service provider in tree format](media/image11.png)

Figure 7: The w7 APPLICATION configuration service provider in tree format

**APPADDR:** This characteristic is used in the w7 APPLICATION characteristic to specify the DM server address.

**APPADDR/ADDR:** Optional. The ADDR parameter is used in the APPADR characteristic to get or set the address of the OMA DM server. This parameter takes a string value.

**APPADDR/ADDRTYPE:** Optional. The ADDRTYPE parameter is used in the APPADDR Characteristic to get or set the format of the ADDR parameter. This parameter takes a string value. In OMA DM XML, if there are multiple instances of this parameter, the first valid parameter value is used.

**APPADDR/PORT:** This characteristic is used in the APPADDR characteristic to specify port information.

**APPADDR/PORT/PORTNBR:** Required. The PORTNBR parameter is used in the PORT characteristic to get or set the number of the port to connect to. This parameter takes a numeric value in string format.

**APPAUTH:** This characteristic is used in the w7 APPLICATION characteristic to specify authentication information. This node is optional for MAM.<16> If this is not specified, it is assumed that transport-level authentication will be used.

**APPAUTH/AAUTHDATA:** Optional. The AAUTHDATA parameter is used in the APPAUTH characteristic to get or set additional data used in authentication. This parameter is used to convey the nonce for digest authentication type. This parameter takes a string value. The value of this parameter is a [**base64-encoded**](#gt_179b9392-9019-45a3-880b-26f6890522b7) string in the form of a series of bytes. Note that if the AAUTHTYPE is DIGEST, this is used as a nonce value in the [**MD5 hash**](#gt_md5-hash) calculation, and the octal form of the binary data is used to calculate the hash at the server side and device side.

**APPAUTH/AAUTHLEVEL:** Required. The AAUTHLEVEL parameter is used in the APPAUTH characteristic to indicate whether credentials are for server authentication or client authentication. This parameter takes a string value. Implementers can set this value.

Valid values:

- APPSRV - Specifies that the client authenticates itself to the OMA DM Server at the DM protocol level.
- CLIENT - Specifies that the server authenticates itself to the OMA DM Client at the DM protocol level.
**APPAUTH/AAUTHNAME:** Optional. The AAUTHNAME parameter is used in the APPAUTH characteristic to differentiate OMA DM client names. This parameter takes a string value. Implementers can set this value.

**APPAUTH/AAUTHSECRET:** Required. The AAUTHSECRET parameter is used in the APPAUTH characteristic to get or set the authentication secret used to authenticate the user. This parameter takes a string value.

**APPAUTH/AAUTHTYPE:** Optional. The AAUTHTYPE parameter of the APPAUTH characteristic is used to get or set the method of authentication. This parameter takes a string value.

Valid values:

- BASIC - Specifies the SyncML DM 'syncml:auth-basic' authentication type.
- DIGEST - Specifies the SyncML DM 'syncml:auth-md5' authentication type.
When AAUTHLEVEL is CLIENT, AAUTHTYPE MUST contain DIGEST. When AAUTHLEVEL is APPSRV, AAUTHTYPE can be BASIC or DIGEST.

**APPID:** Required. The APPID parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to differentiate the types of available application services and protocols. This parameter takes a string value. Implementers can get or set this value. The only valid value to configure the OMA Client Provisioning bootstrap APPID is w7.

**BACKCOMPATRETRYDISABLED:** Optional. The BACKCOMPATRETRYDISABLED parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to specify whether to retry resending a package with an older protocol version (for example, 1.1) in the SyncHdr (not including the first time).

**Note:** This parameter does not contain a value. The existence of this parameter means backward compatibility retry is disabled. If the parameter is missing, it means backward compatibility retry is enabled.

**CONNRETRYFREQ:** Optional. The CONNRETRYFREQ parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to specify how many retries the [**device management client**](#gt_device-management-client) performs when there are Connection Manager-level or WinInet-level errors. This parameter takes a numeric value in string format. The default value is "3". Implementers can set this parameter.

**DEFAULTENCODING:** Optional. The DEFAULTENCODING parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to specify whether the device management client uses [**Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Binary XML (WBXML)**](#gt_wireless-application-protocol-wap-binary-xml-wbxml) ([[WBXML1.2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=160492)) or XML for the DM package when communicating with the server. Implementers can get or set this parameter.

Valid values:

- application/vnd.syncml.dm+xml (Default)
- application/vnd.syncml.dm+wbxml
**INIT:** Optional. The INIT parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to indicate that the management server wants the client to initiate a management session immediately after settings approval. If the current w7 APPLICATION document will be put in ROM, the INIT parameter MUST not be present.

**Note:** This parameter is only for mobile operators and MDM servers that try to use this will fail. This parameter forces the device to attempt to connect with the OMA DM server. The connection attempt fails if the XML is set during the coldinit phase. A common cause of this failure is that immediately after coldinit is finished the radio is not yet ready.

**INITIALBACKOFFTIME:** Optional. The INITIALBACKOFFTIME parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to specify the initial wait time in milliseconds when the device management client retries for the first time. The wait time grows exponentially. This parameter takes a numeric value in string format. The default value is "16000". Implementers can get or set this parameter.

**MAXBACKOFFTIME:** Optional. The MAXBACKOFFTIME parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to specify the maximum number of milliseconds to sleep after package-sending failure. This parameter takes a numeric value in string format. The default value is "86400000". Implementers can set this parameter.

**NAME:** Optional. The NAME parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to specify a user readable application identity. This parameter is used to define part of the registry path for the APPLICATION parameters. Implementers can set this parameter. The NAME parameter can be a string or null (no value). If no value is specified, the registry location will default to <unnamed>.

**PROTOVER:** Optional. The PROTOVER parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to specify the [**OMA-DM**](#gt_oma-dm) Protocol version the server supports. No default value is assumed. The protocol version set by this node will match the protocol version that the device management client reports to the server in SyncHdr in package 1. If this node is not specified when adding a DM server account, the latest DM protocol version that the client supports is used. This is a custom parameter.<17> Implementers can set this parameter.

Possible values:

- 1.1
- 1.2
**PROVIDER-ID:** Optional. The PROVIDER-ID parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to differentiate OMA DM servers. It specifies the server identifier for a management server used in the current management session. This parameter takes a string value. Implementers can set this parameter.

**ROLE:** Optional. The ROLE parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to specify the security application chamber that the DM session runs with when communicating with the DM server. The only supported roles are 8 (mobile operator) and 32 (enterprise). If this parameter is not present, the mobile operator role is assumed. The enterprise role can only be set by the enterprise enrollment client. The enterprise client cannot set the mobile operator role. This parameter takes a numeric value in string format. This is a custom parameter.<18> Implementers can get or set this parameter.

**TO-NAPID:** Optional. The TO-NAPID parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to specify the Network Access Point the client will use to connect to the OMA DM server. If multiple TO-NAPID parameters are specified, only the first TO-NAPID value will be stored. This parameter takes a string value. Implementers can set this parameter.

**USEHWDEVID:** Optional. The USEHWDEVID parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to specify use of device hardware identification. It does not have a value. If the parameter is not present, the default behavior is to use an application-specific GUID rather than the hardware device ID.

If the parameter is present, the hardware device ID will be provided at the ./DevInfo/DevID node and in the Source LocURI for the DM package sent to the server. International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMEI) is returned for a Global System for Mobile (GSM) device.

**SSLCLIENTCERTSEARCHCRITERIA:** Optional. The SSLCLIENTCERTSEARCHCRITERIA parameter is used in the APPLICATION characteristic to specify the client certificate search criteria. This parameter supports search by subject attribute and certificate stores. If any other criteria are provided, it is ignored.

The string is a concatenation of name/value pairs, each member of the pair delimited by the "&" character. The name and values are delimited by the "=" character. If there are multiple values, each value is delimited by the Unicode character "U+F000". If the name or value contains characters not in the UNRESERVED set, as specified in [[RFC2396]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90339), then those characters are URI-escaped.

The supported names are Subject and Stores; wildcard certificate search is not supported. Stores specifies which certificate stores the device management client will search to find the SSL/TLS client certificate. The valid store value is "My%5CUser". The store name is not case-sensitive.

**Note:** %EF%80%80 is the UTF8-encoded character U+F000.

Subject specifies the certificate to search for. For example, to specify a certificate with a particular Subject attribute ("CN=Tester,O=Microsoft"), implementers can use the following:

<parm name="SSLCLIENTCERTSEARCHCRITERIA"

value="Subject=CN%3DTester,O%3DMicrosoft&Stores=My%5CUser" />

## 3.1 IDiscoveryService Server Details

This section describes the first and second phases in MDE2 device enrollment: resolving the [**Discovery Service (DS)**](#gt_discovery-service-ds) and discovering the [**ES**](#gt_enrollment-service-es). The following diagram highlights these two phases.

![MDE2 device enrollment: resolving the DS and discovering the ES](media/image12.png)

Figure 8: MDE2 device enrollment: resolving the DS and discovering the ES

The **IDiscoveryService** in MDE2 hosts an endpoint to receive messages from the [**enrollment client**](#gt_enrollment-client). When a **Discover** request message (section [3.1.4.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.4.1.1.1)) is received from the client, the server processes the request and returns a **DiscoverResponse** message (section [3.1.4.1.1.2](#Section_3.1.4.1.1.2)) to the client. The response identifies the endpoints to be used by the client to obtain the security tokens and enroll via the ES. After the response message is sent to the client, the server returns to the waiting state.

The following diagram shows the role of the server in resolving the Discovery Service (DS) for the enrollment client.

![Role of server in resolving the DS](media/image13.png)

Figure 9: Role of server in resolving the DS

As a prerequisite for enabling the enrollment client to discover the Discovery Service (DS), the administrator MUST configure the [**DNS**](#gt_domain-name-system-dns), such that the name "EnterpriseEnrollment.*[User's Domain]*" resolves to the Discovery Service (DS). The enrollment client extracts the domain suffix from the email address of the enrolling user and prepends it with the DNS to construct the address for the DS. For example, if the email address for the user is "user1@contoso.com", the enrollment client extracts the domain suffix "contoso.com" and prepends it with the DNS to construct the DS address "EnterpriseEnrollment.*contoso.com*".

In the example, the full URL sent by the client to the DS is "`https://EnterpriseEnrollment.contoso.com/EnrollmentServer/Discovery.svc`".

The path portion of the URL "`/EnrollmentServer/Discovery.svc`" is always constant.

The enrollment client validates the [**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**](#gt_secure-sockets-layer-ssl) [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) that is protecting the DS endpoint, along with any intermediary certificates that are signed by a trusted [**CA**](#gt_certification-authority-ca).

## 3.2 Interaction with Security Token Service (STS)

This section describes the third phase in MDE2 device enrollment: requesting and receiving the [**security token**](#gt_security-token). The following diagram highlights this phase.

![MDE2 device enrollment: requesting and receiving the security token](media/image14.png)

Figure 10: MDE2 device enrollment: requesting and receiving the security token

After the [**enrollment client**](#gt_enrollment-client) receives the **DiscoverResponse** message (section [3.1.4.1.1.2](#Section_3.1.4.1.1.2)), the client obtains a security token from the [**STS**](#gt_security-token-service-sts) specified in the value for the <DiscoveryResponse><AuthenticationServiceUrl> element (section [3.1.4.1.3.2](#Section_3.1.4.1.3.2)).

**Note** The enrollment client is agnostic with regards to the protocol flows for authenticating and returning the security token. While the STS might prompt for user credentials directly or enter into a federation protocol with an STS and directory service, MDE2 is agnostic to all of this. To remain agnostic, all protocol flows pertaining to authentication that involve the enrollment client are passive, that is, browser-implemented.

The following are the explicit requirements for the STS.

The <DiscoveryResponse><AuthenticationServiceUrl> element (section 3.1.4.1.3.2) MUST support HTTPS.

The enrollment client issues an HTTPS request as follows.

AuthenticationServiceUrl?appru=<appid>&login_hint=<User Principal Name>

`<appid>` is of the form `ms-app://string`

<User Principal Name> is the name of the enrolling user, for example, `user@constoso.com`. The value of this attribute serves as a hint that can be used by the STS as part of the authentication.

After authentication is complete, the STS SHOULD return an [**HTML form**](#gt_html-form) document with a POST method action of `appid` identified in the [**query string**](#gt_query-string) parameter. For example,

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

The STS has to send a POST to a redirect [**URL**](#gt_uniform-resource-locator-url) of the form `ms-app://string` (the [**URL scheme**](#gt_url-scheme) is `ms-app`) as indicated in the POST method action. The security token in *wresult* is later passed back in <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> (section [3.3](#Section_3.3)). This string is opaque to the enrollment client; the client does not interpret the string.

## 3.3 Interaction with X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy

This section describes the fourth phase in MDE2 device enrollment: interacting with the X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy Protocol [MS-XCEP](../MS-XCEP/MS-XCEP.md) to obtain the [**certificate policies**](#gt_certificate-policy). The following diagram highlights this phase.

![MDE2 device enrollment: getting the certificate policies](media/image15.png)

Figure 11: MDE2 device enrollment: getting the certificate policies

The X.509 Certificate Enrollment Policy Protocol [MS-XCEP] enables a client to request [**certificate enrollment policies**](#gt_b8b89448-1696-4337-aeb3-7f6fbf117915) from a server. The communication is initiated by the [**enrollment client**](#gt_enrollment-client) request to the server for the certificate enrollment policies. The server authenticates the client, validates the request, and returns a response with a collection of certificate enrollment policy objects. As specified in section [3.2](#Section_3.2), the enrollment client uses the [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) enrollment policies to complete the enrollment process [MS-WSTEP](../MS-WSTEP/MS-WSTEP.md). MDE2 uses the policies to allow the [**ES**](#gt_enrollment-service-es) to specify the hash algorithm and key length as described in the following section.

**Authentication**

MDE2 implements the authentication provisions in WS-Security 2004 [[WSS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=130727) to enable the ES [MS-XCEP] to authenticate the **GetPolicies** requestor [MS-XCEP]. This section defines the schema used to express the credential descriptor for the credential type. The [**security token**](#gt_security-token) credential is provided in a request message using the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element [WSS]. The security token is retrieved as specified in section 3.2. The authentication information is as follows:

**wsse:Security:** MDE2 implements the <wsse:Security> element defined in [WSS] section 5. The <wsse:Security> element MUST be a child of the <s:Header> element (see [MS-XCEP] section 4).

**wsse:BinarySecurityToken:** MDE2 implements the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element defined in [WSS] section 6.3. The <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element MUST be included as a child of the <wsse:Security> element in the SOAP header.

- As specified in section 3.2, inclusion of the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element is opaque to the enrollment client and the client does not interpret the string and inclusion of the element is agreed upon by the [**STS**](#gt_security-token-service-sts) (as identified in the **DS** <AuthenticationServiceUrl> element of <DiscoveryResponse> (section [3.1.4.1.3.2](#Section_3.1.4.1.3.2)) and the ES.
- The <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element contains a [**base64**](#gt_179b9392-9019-45a3-880b-26f6890522b7)-encoded string. The enrollment client uses the security token received from the STS and base64-encodes the token to populate the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element.
**wsse:BinarySecurityToken/attributes/ValueType:** The <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> ValueType attribute MUST be `"http://schemas.microsoft.com/5.0.0.0/ConfigurationManager/Enrollment/DeviceEnrollmentUserToken".`

**wsse:BinarySecurityToken/attributes/EncodingType:** The <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> EncodingType attribute MUST be `"http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd#base64binary".`

## 3.4 Interaction with WS-Trust X.509v3 Token Enrollment

This section describes the fifth phase in MDE2 device enrollment: interacting with the WS-Trust X.509v3 Token Enrollment Extensions [MS-WSTEP](../MS-WSTEP/MS-WSTEP.md) to complete enrollment. The following diagram highlights this final phase.

![MDE device enrollment: completing enrollment](media/image16.png)

Figure 12: MDE device enrollment: completing enrollment

The WS-Trust X509v3 Enrollment Extensions [MS-WSTEP] are extensions of WS-Trust Security 2004 [[WSS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=130727) that are used by a system to request that a [**certificate**](#gt_certificate) be issued. MDE2 implements an extension profile of the extensions defined in [MS-WSTEP], to enable a device to be enrolled and receive an identity. The following sections specify the details of the MDE2 profile of and extensions defined in [MS-WSTEP].

**Authentication**

The WS-Trust X509v3 Enrollment Extensions [MS-WSTEP] use the authentication provisions in WS-Security 2004 [WSS] to enable the X509v3 [**security token**](#gt_security-token) issuer to authenticate the X509v3 security token requestor. This section defines the schema used to express the credential descriptor for each supported credential type. The security token credential is provided in a request message using the <wsse:BinarySecurityToken> element [WSS]. The security token is retrieved as specified in section [3.2](#Section_3.2). The authentication information is as follows:

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

MDE2 does not provide message-level signing or message-level encryption for any messages. Implementers can make use of transport protection as available in HTTPS to provide security to the client/server interaction.

MDE2 does not define a mechanism to limit a client's use of server resources, such as CPU, network bandwidth, and memory.
