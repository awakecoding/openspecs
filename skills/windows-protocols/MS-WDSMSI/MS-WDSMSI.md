# 1 Introduction

The Multicast Session Initiation Protocol specifies communication between a client and a Windows Deployment Services server to initiate a Multicast Session. It is a client/server protocol which specifies two mechanisms for the client to request initiation of a Multicast Session from the server.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_client-security-mode"></a>
**Client Security Mode**: Specifies the mechanism used by the client to add validation information to each packet sent by the client to the server using the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol.

<a id="gt_configuration-string"></a>
**Configuration String**: A Unicode string that is used by multicast namespace to instruct the content provider about the content required to be exposed.

<a id="gt_content"></a>
**content**: Identified by a unique name under a given multicast namespace. The [**content metadata**](#gt_content-metadata) cannot change during the lifetime of a multicast session, and is required to allow random access to the data.

<a id="gt_content-metadata"></a>
**Content Metadata**: Specifies an opaque binary data that is associated with the content.

<a id="gt_content-provider"></a>
**Content Provider**: A module that is loaded by the server and is responsible for providing access to the data for the content under a multicast namespace.

<a id="gt_endpoint-guid"></a>
**Endpoint GUID**: Set of relevant services provided by a Service Provider are grouped together and as a whole identified by a unique Endpoint GUID.

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_multicast"></a>
**multicast**: The ability of a transport protocol, such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP), to deliver messages to a group of recipients simultaneously without duplication of message unless the link to recipients is split.

<a id="gt_multicast-address"></a>
**multicast address**: A recipient that subscribes to the network address to receive packets sent using Multicast UDP. In a multicast address scenario, a packet is sent once by the sender and is delivered to all subscribers.

<a id="gt_multicast-namespace"></a>
**multicast namespace**: Hosts multiple content that are available to clients using multicast sessions. Identification by a unique name is required. All content under a multicast namespace is available for transmission over multicast transmission.

<a id="gt_multicast-session"></a>
**Multicast Session**: A session setup by the server to transmit content to multiple clients using the WDS Multicast Application Protocol and the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol.

<a id="gt_rsa-key"></a>
**RSA Key**: A public/private key pair generated using RSA algorithm. The private key is used to sign the packets for the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol and the public key is used by clients to validate the signatures.

<a id="gt_security-identifier-sid"></a>
**security identifier (SID)**: An identifier for security principals that is used to identify an account or a group. Conceptually, the [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is composed of an account authority portion (typically a domain) and a smaller integer representing an identity relative to the account authority, termed the relative identifier (RID). The [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) format is specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.4.2; a string representation of [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2 and [MS-AZOD](../MS-AZOD/MS-AZOD.md) section 1.1.1.2.

<a id="gt_security-mode"></a>
**Security Mode**: Specifies the mechanism used by server and clients to validate the packets sent using the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol.

<a id="gt_server-security-mode"></a>
**Server Security Mode**: Specifies the mechanism used by server to add validation information to each packet sent by server to clients using the WDS Multicast Transport Protocol.

<a id="gt_wds-server"></a>
**WDS server**: A Windows Deployment Services (WDS) server that communicates with clients by using the WDS OS Deployment Protocol to aid in deployment of an OS image on a client machine. Clients also communicate to a WDS server to request initiation/setup of multicast sessions for content available in multicast namespace on server.A WDS server provides an extensible mechanism to allow service providers to provide services to clients.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

### 1.2.2 Informative References

None.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

A typical interaction between client and server involves the following:

- The client has already obtained the following information.
- Name or IP address of server.
- Name of [**multicast namespace**](#gt_multicast-namespace).
- Name of the [**content**](#gt_content) in multicast namespace.
- The client uses the Multicast Session Initiation Protocol to request content in the multicast namespace be set up for delivery using [**multicast**](#gt_multicast) transmission.
- On receiving the request, the server sets up the [**multicast session**](#gt_multicast-session) for the specified content in the multicast namespace and sends the details of the multicast session to the client.
<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Multicast Session Initiation Protocol specifies two mechanisms for clients to request initiation of a multicast session. One uses the WDS Control Protocol, and the other uses UDP. Both are described in the following subsections.

<a id="Section_1.4.1"></a>
### 1.4.1 Using the WDS Control Protocol

The Multicast Session Initiation Protocol uses the WDS Control Protocol to send a request to the server, which allows the user identity to be transported to the server with the request. The following diagram illustrates the relationship of the Multicast Session Initiation Protocol and how it relates to the WDS Control Protocol.

![Protocol relationships](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Protocol relationships

<a id="Section_1.4.2"></a>
### 1.4.2 Using UDP

The clients can use UDP as a transport to send requests to a server<1>, but this limits all requests to being unauthenticated. The following diagram illustrates the relationship of the Multicast Session Initiation Protocol and the UDP Protocol.

![WDSMSI relationship to UDP](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: WDSMSI relationship to UDP

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The WDS Multicast Session Initiation Protocol assumes the client has obtained the following:

- Name or IP address of the server.
- Name of the [**multicast namespace**](#gt_multicast-namespace).
- Name of the [**content**](#gt_content) in the multicast namespace.
- Authentication requirements for the content.
If the server requires a user identity to control access to the content, then the client MUST use the WDS Multicast Session Initiation Protocol over the WDS Control Protocol; otherwise the client MAY use the Multicast Session Initiation Protocol over UDP.

The content MAY have associated [**content metadata**](#gt_content-metadata), which clients MUST understand in order to consume the content. The server is responsible for transporting the content metadata from server to clients but treats it as opaque binary data.

An agreement MUST exist between the multicast namespace and the [**content provider**](#gt_content-provider) on the format of the [**configuration string**](#gt_configuration-string), which is used by the multicast namespace to instruct the content provider to expose the appropriate content for the multicast namespace.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is applicable when a client is required to download [**content**](#gt_content) from a server using [**multicast session**](#gt_multicast-session), and uses the WDS Multicast Session Initiation Protocol to request that the server set up the content for delivery over the multicast session.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas.

- Supported Transports: This protocol can be implemented on top of the WDS Control Protocol and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
- Security and Authentication Methods: The WDS Multicast Session Initiation Protocol over the WDS Control Protocol supports authentication. The security requirements are specified in section [2.2](#Section_1.3).
- Localization: The protocol does not support localization, and as such acts as a pass-through for all strings.
- Capability Negotiation: The protocol does explicit capability negotiations for certain Endpoint [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) and OpCodes as specified in the following section.
| Capability | Section |
| --- | --- |
| WDSMC_OP_INITIATE | Section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1) |

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

The protocol does not provide any vendor-extensible fields.

This protocol uses Win32 error codes as defined in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.2. Vendors SHOULD reuse those values with their indicated meaning. Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the future.

### 2.2.2 Session Initiation Packets for UDP

The WDS Multicast Session Initiation Protocol over UDP uses a single packet format. The packet format supports options and depending on the type of packet, a different set of options are specified in the packet.

The format for all packets is as follows.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-7: "OpCode"
  8-23: "OptionsCount"
  24-39: "OptionId"
  40-55: "OptionLength"
  56-95: "OptionValue (variable)"
```

**OpCode (1 byte):** MUST be set to the type of packet as specified below.

| OpCode | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| WDSMCSE_OP_REQUEST 0x01 | Multicast Session Initiation Request Packet. Section [2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.1) specifies options that MUST be specified. |
| WDSMCSE_OP_REPLY 0x02 | Multicast Session Initiation Reply Packet. Section [2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2) specifies options that MUST be specified. |

**OptionsCount (2 bytes):** MUST be set to the number of Options specified in the packet.

The set of these three fields, **OptionId**, **OptionLength**, and **OptionValue**, are used to specify value for each option.

**OptionId (2 bytes):** Specifies a numeric value that uniquely identifies the option.

**OptionLength (2 bytes):** Specifies the length, in bytes, for the value of the option.

**OptionValue (variable):** Specifies the value for the option. The length for this field is specified by the **OptionLength** field.

<a id="Section_2.2.2.1"></a>
#### 2.2.2.1 Multicast Session Initiation Request Packet

This packet is sent by the client to server on the UDP port specified in section [1.9](#Section_1.9). This packet is used to request the server to set up specified content for delivery using [**multicast**](#gt_multicast) session.

The format for this packet is specified in section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2). The request packet MUST include the Options specified below.

| Option Id | Description |
| --- | --- |
| WDSMCSE_OPT_NAMESPACE 0x0601 | Specifies the name for multicast namespace. The value MUST be a Unicode string with the individual characters of the string specified in little-endian format. The last character of the Unicode string MUST be a null character. |
| WDSMCSE_OPT_CONTENT 0x0602 | Specifies the name for content under a multicast namespace. The value MUST be a Unicode string with individual characters of the string specified in little-endian format. The last character for the value MUST be a null character. |
| WDSMCSE_OPT_MAC_ADDRESS 0x050C | Specifies the MAC address of the network interface card being used by the client to communicate with server. |

The request packet MAY specify the following Options:<6>

| Option Id | Description |
| --- | --- |
| WDSMCSE_OPT_IPV6_CAPABLE 0x010D | A single-byte value that MUST be set to 1 if the client is capable of receiving multicast packets using the IPv6 protocol; otherwise the value MUST be set to zero. |

If a request packet does not specify WDSMCSE_OPT_IPV6_CAPABLE option, the server MUST assume that the client is not capable of receiving IPv6 multicast packets.

<a id="Section_2.2.2.2"></a>
#### 2.2.2.2 Multicast Session Initiation Reply Packet

The server sends this packet in response to Multicast Session Initiation Request Packet when the requested content has been set up for delivery using [**multicast session**](#gt_multicast-session). The reply packet MUST be sent using the UDP port specified in section [1.9](#Section_1.9) by the server. If an error occurs that prevents the server from setting up the content for delivery using multicast session, then the server sends the reply packet as specified in section [2.2.2.3](#Section_2.2.2.3).

The format for this packet is specified in section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2). The packet MUST include the options specified below.

| Option Id | Description |

The server MUST assume that the client is running in a pre-OS environment if a request packet is received using the UDP port.

For requests received using the WDS Control Protocol, as specified in [MS-WDSC](../MS-WDSC/MS-WDSC.md), the server MUST assume that the client is running in pre-OS environment if the **Cap** variable specifies the WDSMC_CLIENT_CAP_BOOT_DEVICE flag.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2"></a>
#### 3.1.5.2 WDSMC_OP_INITIATE

This OpCode is used by clients to request set up of content under a [**multicast namespace**](#gt_multicast-namespace) for delivery using [**multicast session**](#gt_multicast-session).

The server MUST follow the steps in the following section for setting up the content for delivery using multicast session.

- MUST match the value of **Namespace** variable to the **Name** property (section [3.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.1.1)) of registered multicast namespaces.
- MUST query the content provider identified by **ContentProvider** property (section [3.1.1.2](#Section_3.1.1.2)) for the content specified by the **Content** variable in the request packet to validate that client has access to [**content**](#gt_content).
If the request packet includes the **Cap** variable, and it specifies WDSMC_CLIENT_CAP_IPV6, then if the server is capable of setting up multicast session for IPv6, the server MUST setup the multicast session using IPv6; otherwise, the server MUST set up the multicast session using IPv4.

If the client is running in a pre-OS environment (section [3.1.5.1.1](#Section_3.1.5.1.1)), the server MUST set both the server and [**client security modes**](#gt_client-security-mode) to WDSMCTP_SEC_CHECKSUM for the multicast session.

If the client is not running in a pre-OS environment, the server MUST set the [**security modes**](#gt_security-mode) as specified for the **ServerSecurityMode** and **ClientSecurityMode** fields (section [3.1.1.3](#Section_3.1.1.3)) for the multicast session. The server MUST provide both the **SignKey** and **HashKey** fields to the multicast session if required by security modes.

The server MUST query the multicast session and add the following variables to the reply packet.

**TpMcAddress.Port**,**TpMcAddress.Address**, **TpUniAddress.Port**, **TpUniAddress.Address**, **SessionId**, **BlockSize**, **TotalBlocks**, **ContentSize**

The server MUST query the associated content provider for any metadata associated with the content, and add it to the reply packet using the **ContentMetadata** variable. If no metadata exists for the content, the server MUST not add the **ContentMetadata** variable to the reply packet.

The server MUST validate that when server or client security mode is set to WDSMCTP_SEC_CHECKSUM, the request packet MUST include the **Cap** variable. **Cap** MUST specify the WDSMC_CLIENT_CAP_CHECKSUM.

If the [**server security mode**](#gt_server-security-mode) being used by the multicast session is WDSMCTP_SEC_SIGN, then the server MUST:

- add the **SignKey** field (section 3.1.1.3) to the reply packet, using the value of the **SignKey** variable
- add the **SymKey** field (section 3.1.1.3) to the reply packet, using the value of the **SymKey** variable.
If the security mode (either client or server) being used by multicast session is WDSMCTP_SEC_HASH, then the server MUST add the following to the reply packet:

- the **HashKey** field (section 3.1.1.3) to the reply packet using the **SymKey** variable.
- the **HashAlgId** field (section 3.1.1.3) to the reply packet using the **HashAlgId** variable.
- the **HMACAlgId** field (section 3.1.1.3) to the reply packet using the **HMACAlgId** variable.
The server MUST construct the security mode (section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1)) and add it to the reply packet using the **SecMode** variable.

The server MUST get the user security identifier and add it to the reply packet using the **UserSid** variable.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.3"></a>
#### 3.1.5.3 Over UDP

The Multicast Session Initiation Request Packet is received by the server on the UDP port specified in section [1.9](#Section_1.9).

The server MUST validate that the request packet specifies WDSMCSE_OPT_NAMESPACE, WDSMCSE_OPT_CONTENT and WDSMCSE_OPT_MAC_ADDRESS options.

The server:

MUST match the value of the **Namespace** variable to the **Name** property (section [3.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.1.1)) of registered multicast namespaces.

MUST verify that **AllowUnauthenticated** (section 3.1.1.1) is set to TRUE (0x00000001).

MUST query the content provider identified by the **ContentProvider** property (section [3.1.1.2](#Section_3.1.1.2)) for the content specified by the **Content** variable in the request packet, in order to validate that the client is allowed access to content.

If the request packet specifies WDSMCSE_OPT_IPV6_CAPABLE, and it is set to 1, and the server is capable of setting up multicast session for IPv6, then the server MUST set up the multicast session using IPv6; otherwise the server MUST set up the multicast session using IPv4.

The server MUST set the server and [**client security modes**](#gt_client-security-mode) to WDSMCTP_SEC_CHECKSUM.

The server MUST query the multicast session and add the following options to the reply packet:

WDSMCSE_OPT_MULTICAST_ADDR, WDSMCSE_OPT_MULTICAST_PORT, WDSMCSE_OPT_SERVER_ADDR, WDSMCSE_OPT_SERVER_PORT, WDSMCSE_OPT_CONTENT_SIZE, WDSMCSE_OPT_TOTAL_BLOCKS, WDSMCSE_OPT_BLOCK_SIZE, WDSMCSE_OPT_SESSION_ID.
