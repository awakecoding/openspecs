# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the HomeGroup Protocol, which is used to create a trust relationship that facilitates the advertising and publishing of content between machines via a peer-to-peer (P2P) infrastructure.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_advanced-encryption-standard-aes"></a>
**Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**: A block cipher that supersedes the Data Encryption Standard (DES). AES can be used to protect electronic data. The AES algorithm can be used to encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) information. Encryption converts data to an unintelligible form called ciphertext; decrypting the ciphertext converts the data back into its original form, called plaintext. AES is used in symmetric-key cryptography, meaning that the same key is used for the encryption and decryption operations. It is also a block cipher, meaning that it operates on fixed-size blocks of plaintext and ciphertext, and requires the size of the plaintext as well as the ciphertext to be an exact multiple of this block size. AES is also known as the Rijndael symmetric encryption algorithm [[FIPS197]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89870).

<a id="gt_device-independent-bitmap-dib"></a>
**device-independent bitmap (DIB)**: A container for bitmapped graphics, which specifies characteristics of the bitmap such that it can be created using one application and loaded and displayed in another application, while retaining an identical appearance.

<a id="gt_fmtid"></a>
**FMTID**: A GUID value that identifies a property set format.

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_homegroup"></a>
**homegroup**: A group of one or more computers that are [**AES**](#gt_advanced-encryption-standard-aes) joined together by using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) through the HomeGroup Protocol, which are able to share resources (files, printers, and so on) with each other.

<a id="gt_internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6"></a>
**Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)**: A revised version of the Internet Protocol (IP) designed to address growth on the Internet. Improvements include a 128-bit IP address size, expanded routing capabilities, and support for authentication and privacy.

<a id="gt_little-endian"></a>
**little-endian**: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the least significant byte stored in the memory location with the lowest address.

<a id="gt_media-access-control-mac-address"></a>
**Media Access Control (MAC) address**: A hardware address provided by the network interface vendor that uniquely identifies each interface on a physical network for communication with other interfaces, as specified in [[IEEE802.3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89911). It is used by the media access control sublayer of the data link layer of a network connection.

<a id="gt_peergroup"></a>
**PeerGroup**: A group of one or more machines connected through the Peer-to-Peer Grouping Security Protocol [MS-PPSEC](#Section_5).

<a id="gt_peer-to-peer"></a>
**peer-to-peer**: A server-less networking technology that allows several participating network devices to share resources and communicate directly with each other.

<a id="gt_rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa"></a>
**Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)**: A system for public key cryptography. [**RSA**](#gt_rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa) is specified in [[PKCS1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90248) and [[RFC3447]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90422).

<a id="gt_service-set-identifier-ssid"></a>
**service set identifier (SSID)**: A sequence of characters that names a wireless local area network (WLAN).

<a id="gt_sha-256"></a>
**SHA-256**: An algorithm that generates a 256-bit hash value from an arbitrary amount of input data, as described in [[FIPS180-2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89868).

<a id="gt_sha-256-hash"></a>
**SHA-256 hash**: The value computed from the hashing function described in [[FIPS180-3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=180409).

<a id="gt_universal-naming-convention-unc"></a>
**Universal Naming Convention (UNC)**: A string format that specifies the location of a resource. For more information, see [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.2.57.

<a id="gt_web-services-on-devices-wsd"></a>
**Web Services on Devices (WSD)**: A function-discovery protocol used to discover and communicate certain data structures in a HomeGroup network environment. Implementation details are specified in [[DPWS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=127841).

<a id="gt_wireless-access-point-wap"></a>
**wireless access point (WAP)**: A wireless network access server (NAS) that implements 802.11.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.2"></a>
## 1.2 References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the [Errata](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=850906).

## 1.3 Overview

The HomeGroup Protocol is used to create a trust relationship that facilitates the advertising and publishing of content between machines via a [**peer-to-peer**](#gt_peer-to-peer) infrastructure.<1><2> This relationship is achieved with the use of [**Web Services on Devices (WSD)**](#gt_web-services-on-devices-wsd) and a [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup) infrastructure. There is no client-server relationship in this protocol; in order to participate in a [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup), all machines implement the protocol in the same manner. For more information, see [[HomeGroupOvw]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178890).

<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 Role of Web Services on Devices (WSD)

[**WSD**](#gt_web-services-on-devices-wsd) is used to publish messages that are discoverable to all machines on the subnet. These messages include the HomeGroup Invitation (section [2.2.1.1](#Section_3.1.5.1)) and Shared Printer (section [2.2.1.2](#Section_2.2.1.2)) messages.

<a id="Section_1.3.2"></a>
### 1.3.2 Role of the PeerGroup

The [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup) is used as a secure line of communication between [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup) members.

<a id="Section_1.3.3"></a>
### 1.3.3 High Level Homegroup Events

<a id="Section_1.3.3.1"></a>
#### 1.3.3.1 Creating a Homegroup

A machine that attempts to create a [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup) accomplishes this by first creating a [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup), which is the secure [**peer-to-peer**](#gt_peer-to-peer) connection through which the homegroup is synchronized, as outlined in [MS-PPSEC](#Section_5). This homegroup machine sets the homegroup password, which is used to secure the homegroup. Once the PeerGroup has been created, this first machine publishes an invitation to the homegroup via [**WSD**](#gt_web-services-on-devices-wsd), which allows new machines on the subnet to discover the homegroup.

<a id="Section_1.3.3.2"></a>
#### 1.3.3.2 Discovering and Joining the Homegroup

A machine detects that there is a [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup) on the subnet by receiving a HomeGroup Invitation message (section [2.2.1.1](#Section_3.1.5.1)) over [**WSD**](#gt_web-services-on-devices-wsd). With the invitation and the correct homegroup password, the machine is able to join the [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup), and by extension, the homegroup.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol depends on [[DPWS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=127841) to enable the discovery of a [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup) on the subnet, and [MS-PPSEC](#Section_5) to create a [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup) for communication between members of the homegroup. These two protocols are used independently of each other; that is, neither protocol sits above the other in the relationship hierarchy.

This protocol also requires that all machines implement the [**Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6)**](#gt_internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6) protocol.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The prerequisites for this protocol include those for the WSD, as described in [[DPWS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=127841), and PeerGroup, as described in [MS-PPSEC](#Section_5).

In addition, this protocol requires the following:

- The underlying [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup) is restricted to machines on the same subnet.
- All members of the [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup) are required to have an [**IPv6**](#gt_internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6) address and to be able to support the cryptography technology defined in section [3.1.4.5](#Section_3.1.4.5).
<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The HomeGroup Protocol specifies a protocol for the creation of a trust relationship that facilitates the advertisement and publishing of content between machines on the same subnet.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document describes version 1 of this protocol, therefore there are no issues with capability negotiation. This protocol does provide versioning capability within the HomeGroup Record message (section [2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2)) in both the <SOURCEOS> and <VERSION> elements.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

None.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

Transport for this protocol is achieved through two channels: the [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup) and [**WSD**](#gt_web-services-on-devices-wsd), both of which are independent of the other. WSD is used to publish messages that are available to all machines on the subnet. The PeerGroup is used for sending secure communication between members of the [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup).

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

All messages are generated in XML format. The following sections use the terminology *sections*, *keys*, and *values* to specify concrete syntax for each message. This specification uses globally unique identifiers ([**GUIDs**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid)), as specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.3.4.3.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 WSD Messages

All messages described in this section MUST be transported using [**WSD**](#gt_web-services-on-devices-wsd) and published to the local subnet. The [**HomeGroup**](#gt_homegroup) Protocol uses WSD messages to advertise the presence of a homegroup, as well as shared resources on the home network.

<a id="Section_2.2.1.1"></a>
#### 2.2.1.1 HomeGroup Invitation

The HomeGroup Invitation message is used to advertise the presence of the [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup) to other machines on the home network and to provide the required details to allow them to join that homegroup. This message has the [**WSD**](#gt_web-services-on-devices-wsd) type of: HomeGroup_Invitation.

The HomeGroup invitation includes the [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup) invitation (which is required to join the PeerGroup) and other relevant information about the homegroup, as described in this section. The invitation is serialized into an XML string and then published on the local subnet using WSD.

**INVITATION:** The actual invitation from the PeerGroup. The format for this message and the manner in which it is generated is described in [MS-PPSEC](#Section_5).

**NETWORKNAME:** If any member of the homegroup is connected wirelessly to the network, this value is the [**service set identifier (SSID)**](#gt_service-set-identifier-ssid) of the [**wireless access point (WAP)**](#gt_wireless-access-point-wap). If all machines are wired, then this value is NULL. The value for this element is the same across all of the homegroup members. If a new member of the homegroup is the first to use WAP, then this element is updated to reflect the SSID of the WAP.

**GUIDNAME:** A unique [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) that represents this homegroup. The value is the same for all homegroup members, and is generated when the PeerGroup is created [MS-PPSEC].

**OWNER:** The name of the user who last reset the pin on this homegroup, or if the pin has never been reset, it is the User who created the homegroup. The value is the same for all homegroup members.

**OWNERID:** The Peer Identity of the machine where the owner user resides [MS-PPSEC]. The value is the same for all homegroup members.

**OWNERMACHINENAME:** The machine name of the machine that created the homegroup. The value is the same for all homegroup members.

**LASTCHANGED:** The Int64 text representation of a FILETIME structure that represents the last time the pin was reset, or if never reset, the time that the homegroup was originally created, as described in [MS-FSCC](../MS-FSCC/MS-FSCC.md). The value is the same for all homegroup members.

**HOMEGROUPSIZE:** The number of members in the PeerGroup, and by extension, the homegroup. This is expressed as an integer value.

**ADDRESS:** The [**IPv6**](#gt_internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6) addresses of the network adapter to which the PeerGroup is connected. This list of addresses is semicolon-delimited and can be specified using any valid IPv6 address format, as described in [[RFC3513]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90427)

**DIGITALHASH:** The values contained in the <NETWORKNAME> (if not empty), <GUIDNAME>, <OWNER> (if not empty), <OWNERID> (if not empty), <OWNERMACHINENAME> (if not empty), <LASTCHANGED>, <HOMEGROUPSIZE>, and <ADDRESS> elements that are hashed together and then signed using the homegroup signing keys. The signing and hashing process is described in section [3.1.4.5.3](#Section_3.1.4.5.3).

<a id="Section_2.2.2.2.4"></a>
##### 2.2.2.2.4 Data Protection Listener

The Data Protection Listener<7> enables a user to back up their data to a different device from the device where it is currently located. This feature allows the user to recover data if the original copy is damaged.

Data protection is intended to be a backup solution for home users. One of the objectives of data protection is to enable multiple users in a single household to share the same external device. To achieve this goal, the HomeGroup infrastructure is used. A user on one PC configures an external device and selects to share that device within the [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup). The sharing of the device creates a folder on the external device with a [**Universal Naming Convention (UNC)**](#gt_universal-naming-convention-unc) share to the folder, and broadcasts a message containing information about the UNC share in the homegroup. The UNC share is then visible to all users across all PCs within the homegroup. Users can then select the shared device and specify it as the location where all data is to be sent for backup.

The broadcast message contains the GUID {ADBCFEA5-D8FC-4a46-B12B-EB1FFE39BF17}.

<xs:element name="UserName" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1" />

</xs:sequence>

</xs:complexType>

</xs:element>

**SchemaVersion:** The version number of the schema defined for the broadcast message.

**TargetUNC:** The UNC path of the share which is accessible only to users in the homegroup. Users can select this UNC share as the external device to use for data protection, that is, the device where all of the user data is sent for backup.

**FriendlyName:** A name that is used by all users in the homegroup to refer to the shared device.

**UserName:** The name of the user who originally configured and shared the device in the homegroup. This user knows which physical device has the UNC share.

<a id="Section_2.2.2.2.5"></a>
##### 2.2.2.2.5 HomeGroup Signing Key

[**HomeGroup**](#gt_homegroup) Signing Key messages are used to distribute signing keys to the homegroup. The signing keys are used to verify the integrity of signed [**WSD**](#gt_web-services-on-devices-wsd) messages that are sent by homegroup members over WSD.

HomeGroup Signing Key messages are sent within the HomeGroup Record format (section [2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2)), where the following elements are specified:

- The value of the <RECORDSOURCE> element is set to {CA328F46-E759-4399-82AB-FA92651D1ED2}.
- The value of the <PERSIST> element is set to 1.
The <HOMEGROUP_DATA> element is populated with the HomeGroup Signing Key message content in the following manner:

**EncodedKeyBlob (3260 bytes):** This MUST be generated by the following procedure:

- Randomly generate a 2048-bit [**RSA**](#gt_rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa) key pair and encode it as an **RSAKeyBlob** structure as specified in section [2.2.2.2.5.1](#Section_2.2.2.2.5.1). The RSA algorithm is specified in [[RFC3447]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90422) and recommended methods for generating RSA keys are described in [[FIPS186]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89869).
- Generate a 256-bit [**AES**](#gt_advanced-encryption-standard-aes) key [[FIPS197]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89870) by concatenating the homegroup [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) and the homegroup password and hashing the result with the [**SHA-256**](#gt_sha-256) algorithm [[FIPS180-3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=180409). In this procedure, the homegroup GUID is represented in the Curly-Braced String Representation specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.3.4.3 and encoded as a Unicode string in [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) UTF-16 encoding with the terminating NULL character and the homegroup password is represented as a Unicode string in little-endian UTF-16 encoding with the terminating NULL character.
- Encrypt the **RSAKeyBlob** generated in Step 1 with the AES key generated in Step 2, using the AES-256 block cipher [FIPS197] in Cipher Block Chaining mode [[SP800-38A]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=128809) with a zero Initialization Vector (IV).
- Encode the result from Step 3 with the Base64 encoding scheme specified in [[RFC4648]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90487) section 4, with a 64-bit line length and a terminating line feed. Note that line feeds are CR-LF combinations.
- Represent the result from Step 4 as a Unicode string in little-endian UTF-16 encoding.

# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Homegroup Member Details

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

To implement the HomeGroup Protocol, an individual [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup) member stores and updates the data about itself, as well as the data about other members of the homegroup, which is necessary for sending the messages specified in section [2](#Section_2). Whenever the data maintained by the machine changes, the messages in section 2 SHOULD be re-sent. Resending the messages ensures that new information is propagated to all members of the homegroup.

**Note** The homegroup password is required to join a homegroup, but is never transmitted by this protocol.<8>

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

This protocol is initialized when a machine creates or joins a [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup). When this protocol is first initialized, the machine SHOULD check for the HomeGroup Invitation WSD message (section [2.2.1.1](#Section_3.1.5.1)). If a HomeGroup Invitation is detected, then the machine MAY join the homegroup, as described in section [3.1.4.2](#Section_3.1.4.2).

If no invitation is detected, then the machine MAY create a homegroup, as described in section [3.1.4.1](#Section_1.3.3.1).

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

<a id="Section_3.1.4.1"></a>
#### 3.1.4.1 Creating the Homegroup

To participate in a [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup), a machine MUST create the homegroup when a HomeGroup Invitation message (section [2.2.1.1](#Section_3.1.5.1)) does not exist. This requires a homegroup password. All other machines will then be able to join the homegroup when the first machine's HomeGroup Invitation is detected.

A new homegroup is created by creating a new [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup) with a secure Peer ID [MS-PPSEC](#Section_5). The Peer ID is a unique identifier that other members in the PeerGroup can use to identify a particular member [MS-PPSEC]. The machine then generates the signing keys, as described in section [3.1.4.5.2](#Section_3.1.4.5.2). The machine MUST then take the following actions:

- Send a HomeGroup Signing Key message (section [2.2.2.2.5](#Section_2.2.2.2.5.1)), a HomeGroup Member Info message (section [2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.1)), a HomeGroup User Info record (section [2.2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2.2.2)) for each user on the machine, a HomeGroup Credentials message (section [2.2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.2.1)), and a HomeGroup MAC Address message (section [2.2.2.2.3](#Section_2.2.2.2.2.3)) to the PeerGroup. If the data contained in a message changes, the machine MUST create new messages and send them to the PeerGroup.
- Publish a HomeGroup Invitation [**WSD**](#gt_web-services-on-devices-wsd) message (section 2.2.1.1). If the data contained in the HomeGroup Invitation WSD message changes, the machine MUST create a new HomeGroup Invitation WSD message and publish it on the WSD channel.
- When a printer is attached to the machine that is to be shared, the machine SHOULD also publish a HomeGroup Printer WSD message (section [2.2.1.2](#Section_2.2.1.2)) on the WSD channel. If the printer is unshared, the machine SHOULD remove the printer from the HomeGroup Printer WSD message.
- If a new user is created on the machine, a HomeGroup User Info record (section 2.2.2.2.2) MUST be sent to the PeerGroup for that user account. If a user is deleted from the machine, the HomeGroup User Info record corresponding to that user account MUST be removed from the PeerGroup.
There is no required order for sending or publishing these messages.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.2"></a>
#### 3.1.4.2 Joining the Homegroup

Joining an existing [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup) requires the presence of a HomeGroup Invitation message. Multiple HomeGroup Invitation messages can be present on the network.<9> When a HomeGroup Invitation message has been detected, the machine MUST use the [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup) invitation located in the <INVITATION> element of the HomeGroup Invitation message (section [2.2.1.1](#Section_3.1.5.1)), as well as the homegroup password, to join the PeerGroup.

The machine joins the PeerGroup in the manner described in [MS-PPSEC](#Section_5) section 3.1.4.3. Once the machine has joined the PeerGroup, it is considered a member of the homegroup.<10>

After joining the PeerGroup, the machine MUST then take the following actions:

- Send a HomeGroup Signing Key message (section [2.2.2.2.5](#Section_2.2.2.2.5.1)), a HomeGroup Member Info message (section [2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.1)), a HomeGroup User Info record (section [2.2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2.2.2)) for each user on the machine, and a HomeGroup MAC Address message (section [2.2.2.2.3](#Section_2.2.2.2.2.3)) to the PeerGroup. If the data contained in a message changes, the machine MUST create new messages and send them to the PeerGroup.
- Publish a HomeGroup Invitation [**WSD**](#gt_web-services-on-devices-wsd) message (section 2.2.1.1). If the data contained in the HomeGroup Invitation WSD message changes, the machine MUST create a new HomeGroup Invitation WSD message and publish it on the WSD channel.
- When a printer is attached to the machine that is to be shared, the machine SHOULD also publish a HomeGroup Printer WSD message (section [2.2.1.2](#Section_2.2.1.2)) on the WSD channel. If the printer is unshared, the machine SHOULD remove the printer from the HomeGroup Printer WSD message.
- If a new user is created on the machine, a HomeGroup User Info record (section 2.2.2.2.2) MUST be sent to the PeerGroup for that user account. If a user is deleted from the machine, the HomeGroup User Info record corresponding to that user account MUST be removed from the PeerGroup.
<a id="Section_3.1.4.3"></a>
#### 3.1.4.3 Departing the Homegroup

To depart from the [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup), the machine MUST remove all messages that it sent to the [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup) from the group [MS-PPGRH](../MS-PPGRH/MS-PPGRH.md), except those that are flagged to persist after the machine's departure, as described in sections [2.2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.2.1) and [2.2.2.2.5](#Section_2.2.2.2.5.1) and [MS-PPGRH].

The machine MUST stop publishing the HomeGroup Invitation WSD message and, if applicable, the HomeGroup Printer WSD message.

The machine MAY then close and delete the PeerGroup [MS-PPGRH].<11>

<a id="Section_3.1.4.4"></a>
#### 3.1.4.4 Changing the Homegroup Password

Changing the [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup) password is accomplished by departing the homegroup and creating a new homegroup with the new password.

To change the homegroup password, the machine departs the homegroup, as described in section [3.1.4.3](#Section_3.1.4.3). The machine then creates a new homegroup, as described in section [3.1.4.1](#Section_1.3.3.1). When doing so, both the GUIDNAME name and the signing keys MUST be reused from the departed homegroup. This is done so that when the new homegroup broadcasts its invitation, it will contain the old homegroup name and the digital signature will be signed with the signing keys of the previous homegroup.

The other homegroup machines then detect the new HomeGroup Invitation WSD message and can join the homegroup by supplying the new password, as described in section [3.1.4.2](#Section_3.1.4.2).

<a id="Section_3.1.4.5"></a>
#### 3.1.4.5 Message Signing and Encryption

<a id="Section_3.1.4.5.1"></a>
##### 3.1.4.5.1 Encryption Key

An encryption key is generated when a [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup) is created. The key is formed as specified in the description for the [EncodedKeyBlob](#Section_2.2.2.2.5.1) structure (step 2) in section 2.2.2.2.5.

This encryption key is used to encrypt the HomeGroup Credentials message (section [2.2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.2.1)) account credentials, as well as the public/private signing keys, before sending over the network.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.5.2"></a>
##### 3.1.4.5.2 Public/Private Signing Keys

The creator of the [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup) generates a 2048-bit [**RSA**](#gt_rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa) key pair, as specified in [[RFC3447]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90422) and [[PKCS1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90248).

These keys are encrypted, as described in section [3.1.4.5.5](#Section_3.1.4.5.5), and sent to the other members of the homegroup over the [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup) channel via a HomeGroup Signing Key message (section [2.2.2.2.5](#Section_2.2.2.2.5.1)).

The keys are used to sign or verify the integrity of signed [**WSD**](#gt_web-services-on-devices-wsd) messages sent over the homegroup.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.5.3"></a>
##### 3.1.4.5.3 WSD Hash

HomeGroup Invitation messages (section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1)) are hashed. This hash is signed with the [**HomeGroup**](#gt_homegroup) signing key and the signed version is included in the message in the <DIGITALHASH> element.

The hash is an [**SHA-256 hash**](#gt_sha-256-hash) of the following values in the order specified:

- <NETWORKNAME> (if it contains a value)
- <GUIDNAME>
- <OWNER> (if it contains a value)
- <OWNERID> (if it contains a value)
- <OWNERMACHINENAME> (if it contains a value)
- <LASTCHANGED>
- <HOMEGROUPSIZE>
- <ADDRESS>
This hash is computed, as specified in [[FIPS180-3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=180409). The optional fields are ignored when they do not contain a value. The hash is then signed with the public signing key described in section [3.1.4.5.2](#Section_3.1.4.5.2), using the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature algorithm specified in [[PKCS1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90248) section 8.2.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.5.4"></a>
##### 3.1.4.5.4 Printer Messages

HomeGroup Printer messages are signed with the public signing key, described in section [3.1.4.5.2](#Section_3.1.4.5.2), using the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature algorithm specified in [[PKCS1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90248) section 8.2.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.5.5"></a>
##### 3.1.4.5.5 Encrypting HomeGroup Credentials, Signing Key and MAC Address

The <PASSWORD> element in the HomeGroup Credentials message and the <SIGNINGKEYS> element in the HomeGroup Signing Key message are encrypted using the Encryption Key (section [3.1.4.5.1](#Section_3.1.4.5.1)) with the [**AES**](#gt_advanced-encryption-standard-aes)-256 algorithm [[FIPS197]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89870) in Cipher Block Chaining mode [[SP800-38A]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=128809) with a zero Initialization Vector (IV).

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>
#### 3.1.5.1 HomeGroup Invitation Messages

When a HomeGroup Invitation message is received by a machine that is not a member of the [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup), the machine will not be able to verify the HomeGroup Invitation message. Instead, the machine can join the homegroup using the HomeGroup Invitation message as described in section [3.1.4.2](#Section_3.1.4.2).

When a HomeGroup Invitation message is received by a machine that is currently a member of the homegroup, the message hash SHOULD be verified using the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature algorithm specified in [[PKCS1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90248) section 8.2. Once the HomeGroup Invitation message is verified, if the value of the <GUIDNAME> element for the message matches the <GUIDNAME> value for the current homegroup, and if the value of the <LASTCHANGED> element element for the message is newer than the <LASTCHANGED> value for the current homegroup, then a password reset condition is detected and the machine MUST change the password as defined in section [3.1.4.4](#Section_3.1.4.4).

<a id="Section_3.1.5.2"></a>
#### 3.1.5.2 Printer Messages

When a Printer message is received, it MUST be decoded from Base64, as described in [[RFC3548]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90432), and SHOULD then be verified using the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature algorithm, specified in [[PKCS1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90248) section 8.2.

Once verified, the machine SHOULD add the printer as described in [MS-RPRN](../MS-RPRN/MS-RPRN.md).

<a id="Section_3.1.5.3"></a>
#### 3.1.5.3 HomeGroup Credentials and Signing Key Messages

Whenever a HomeGroup Credentials message or a HomeGroup Signing Key message is received, its encrypted fields MUST be decrypted using the Encryption Key (section [3.1.4.5.1](#Section_3.1.4.5.1)) with the [**AES**](#gt_advanced-encryption-standard-aes)-256 algorithm [[FIPS197]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89870) in Cipher Block Chaining mode [[SP800-38A]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=128809) with a zero Initialization Vector (IV).

<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>
### 3.1.6 Timer Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.7"></a>
### 3.1.7 Other Local Events

For the purposes of participating in this protocol, any messages that are received over [**WSD**](#gt_web-services-on-devices-wsd) or [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup) that do not conform to the message formats described in section [2](#Section_2) SHOULD be ignored.

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

The HomeGroup Protocol relies partially on the Peer-to-Peer Grouping Security Protocol [MS-PPSEC](#Section_5) to secure the [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup) traffic. Encryption and hashing within the sent messages is achieved through open cryptographic standards.

# 6 Appendix A: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

The terms "earlier" and "later", when used with a product version, refer to either all preceding versions or all subsequent versions, respectively. The term "through" refers to the inclusive range of versions. Applicable Microsoft products are listed chronologically in this section.

- Windows 7 operating system
- Windows Home Server 2011 server software
- Windows 8 operating system
- Windows 8.1 operating system
- Windows 10 operating system
- Windows 10 v1809 operating system
Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.3: In Windows, the protocol excludes the relationship to machines that exist on the same subnet.

<2> Section 1.3: This protocol is disabled in the Windows 10 v1803 operating system and later.

<3> Section 2.2.2.1: The <property> element is optional. It is not supported in Windows 7 and Windows Home Server 2011.

<4> Section 2.2.2.1: The HomeGroup Member Info record contains the following two properties. To maintain backwards compatibility with the HomeGroup Member Info record available in Windows 7, these two properties are defined as optional. They are not supported in Windows Home Server 2011.

| Property name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OSVersion | A 32-bit, unsigned integer representing the version number of the operating system. When this property is not set, the value is considered to be the OSVersion number for Windows 7 (0x0601). | VT_UI4 (0x0013) |
| DomainJoined | A Boolean value that indicates whether the machine is joined to the domain. A value of 1 indicates that the machine is joined to the domain; otherwise, the value is set to 0. | VT_BOOL (0x000B) |

<5> Section 2.2.2.2.1: In Windows every [**homegroup**](#gt_homegroup) member has a common user account with the same password, which is used to authenticate between members of the homegroup.

<6> Section 2.2.2.2.2: The HomeGroup User Info record is not supported in Windows 7 and Windows Home Server 2011.

<7> Section 2.2.2.2.4: The Data Protection Listener is not supported in Windows 7 and Windows Home Server 2011.

<8> Section 3.1.1: In Windows, this password can be auto-generated by the machine that is creating the homegroup, or supplied by a user.

<9> Section 3.1.4.2: In Windows, if more than one HomeGroup Invitation message is found, then the protocol will attempt to join the [**PeerGroup**](#gt_peergroup) specified in each HomeGroup Invitation until successful. The order in which the HomeGroup Invitation messages are processed is undefined.

<10> Section 3.1.4.2: In Windows, after the PeerGroup invitation has been issued, the machine then collects and stores the information from the HomeGroup Credentials message and the HomeGroup MAC address message, as well as from the signing keys found in the HomeGroup Signing Key message.

<11> Section 3.1.4.3: In Windows, the machine closes and deletes the Peergroup after departing the homegroup when it is the last member of the homegroup. In the case where the password change has occurred and the machine is not the last member of the homegroup, the homegroup is not closed and deleted.
