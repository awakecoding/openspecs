# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Remote Authorization API Protocol. The Remote Authorization API Protocol is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC)-based protocol used to perform various authorization queries on remote computers.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_access-control-decision"></a>
**access control decision**: Choosing whether to allow a user access of a resource on a specific remote service based on a given authorization policy.

<a id="gt_access-control-list-acl"></a>
**access control list (ACL)**: A list of access control entries (ACEs) that collectively describe the security rules for authorizing access to some resource; for example, an object or set of objects.

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses LDAP as its primary access protocol. [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) stores information about a variety of objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md). [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is either deployed as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), which are both described in [MS-ADOD](../MS-ADOD/MS-ADOD.md): Active Directory Protocols Overview.

<a id="gt_authorization-policy"></a>
**authorization policy**: A set of rules that govern a user's access to one or more resources or classes of resources.

<a id="gt_client-context"></a>
**client context**: A context describing an execution environment from which an activation request has originated.

<a id="gt_impersonation-token"></a>
**impersonation token**: A security context, created on the server, that represents the set of rights and privileges of the user. Used to test whether the user is authorized to access a resource.

<a id="gt_principal-self"></a>
**principal self**: A well-known security identifier (SID) used to represent the identity of a security principal when that security principal is also the object that is being protected with a security descriptor. Applicable only to directory objects that are representing security principals, the principal self identifier allows the security descriptor on the directory object to grant specific user rights to the principal itself. As an example, a user object for fred@domain.com might have a security descriptor that allowed principal-self:update-shoe-size. The intent is to allow fred to update his own shoe size. The use of the fixed value SID for principal self prevents every user object from needing a unique security descriptor, thus conserving space in the directory database.

<a id="gt_rpc-endpoint"></a>
**RPC endpoint**: A network-specific address of a server process for remote procedure calls (RPCs). The actual name of the RPC endpoint depends on the RPC protocol sequence being used. For example, for the NCACN_IP_TCP RPC protocol sequence an RPC endpoint might be TCP port 1025. For more information, see [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824).

<a id="gt_security-descriptor"></a>
**security descriptor**: A data structure containing the security information associated with a securable object. A [**security descriptor**](#gt_security-descriptor) identifies an object's owner by its [**security identifier (SID)**](#gt_security-identifier-sid). If access control is configured for the object, its [**security descriptor**](#gt_security-descriptor) contains a discretionary access control list (DACL) with [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) for the security principals who are allowed or denied access. Applications use this structure to set and query an object's security status. The [**security descriptor**](#gt_security-descriptor) is used to guard access to an object as well as to control which type of auditing takes place when the object is accessed. The [**security descriptor**](#gt_security-descriptor) format is specified in [MS-DTYP](#Section_2.2.1) section 2.4.6; a string representation of [**security descriptors**](#gt_security-descriptor), called SDDL, is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.5.1.

<a id="gt_security-identifier-sid"></a>
**security identifier (SID)**: An identifier for security principals that is used to identify an account or a group. Conceptually, the [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is composed of an account authority portion (typically a domain) and a smaller integer representing an identity relative to the account authority, termed the relative identifier (RID). The [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) format is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2; a string representation of [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2 and [MS-AZOD](../MS-AZOD/MS-AZOD.md) section 1.1.1.2.

<a id="gt_smart-card"></a>
**smart card**: A portable device that is shaped like a business card and is embedded with a memory chip and either a microprocessor or some non-programmable logic. [**Smart cards**](#gt_smart-card) are often used as authentication [**tokens**](#gt_token) and for secure key storage. [**Smart cards**](#gt_smart-card) used for secure key storage have the ability to perform cryptographic operations with the stored key without allowing the key itself to be read or otherwise extracted from the card.

<a id="gt_token"></a>
**token**: A set of rights and privileges for a given user.

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and RPC objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [C706] must be used for generating the UUID.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The Remote Authorization API (RAZA) protocol is designed to allow applications to simulate an [**access control decision**](#gt_access-control-decision) that would be made when a given principal attempts to access a resource on a remote service that is protected with a given [**authorization policy**](#gt_authorization-policy). Because these are simulations, they can vary from the actual groups and/or claims in a user's [**token**](#gt_token).

For example, a user can log on with a password, or the user can log on using a [**smart card**](#gt_smart-card) (with authentication assurance provisioned). Each type of logon will result in a different kind of [**impersonation token**](#gt_impersonation-token). Logging on using the password produces an impersonation token with a mapped group or claim; logging on using the smart card produces an impersonation token without a mapped group or claim.

The following are some of the examples of this protocol's applications:

- Simulate the groups and/or claims that a user would have if the user were to authenticate to a remote service.
- Simulate a user's access to a hypothetical resource on a specific remote service that is protected with a given authorization policy.
- Simulate how potential changes to the user's group or claim assignments can affect access to resources on the remote machine.
The RAZA protocol defines client and server protocol roles.<1> A general description of message flow is as follows:

- The RAZA client initiates a RAZA conversation by issuing a request to a RAZA server to initialize and maintain a resource manager object.
- The RAZA server listens to an [**RPC endpoint**](#gt_rpc-endpoint). When a client makes the preceding request, the RAZA server creates and maintains state for a resource manager object on behalf of the client.
- The RAZA client can then request creation of a [**client context**](#gt_client-context) for a user by specifying the user's [**security identifier (SID)**](#gt_security-identifier-sid). After a client context is successfully created on the server, the RAZA client can examine the contents of the client context (for example, the group SIDs and claims within the client context) and/or modify the client context. Additionally, the RAZA client can perform an "AccessCheck" using the client context and a specified [**security descriptor**](#gt_security-descriptor).
RAZA supports the following method calls to provide clients a way to simulate access control decisions.

- AuthzrFreeContext
- AuthzrInitializeContextFromSid
- AuthzrInitializeCompoundContext
- AuthzrAccessCheck
- AuthzGetInformationFromContext
- AuthzrModifyClaims
- AuthzrModifySids
<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Remote Authorization API Protocol is dependent on RPC and TCP for its transport.

No other protocol currently depends on the Remote Authorization API Protocol.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Remote Authorization API Protocol is an RPC interface and, as a result, has the prerequisites specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) (section 1.5) as being common to RPC interfaces.

It is assumed that a Remote Authorization API Protocol client has obtained the name of a remote computer that supports the Remote Authorization API Protocol before this protocol is invoked.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is appropriate only for implementing a tool to remotely approximate and profile "what-if" authorization decisions.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

- **Supported Transports:** This protocol uses multiple RPC Protocol Sequences as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).
- **Security and Authentication Methods:** As specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.2.1.4.1.
- **Capability Negotiation:** The RAZA protocol does not support negotiation of the interface version to use. Instead, an implementation needs to be configured with the interface version to use.
<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor Extensible Fields

This protocol cannot be extended by any party other than Microsoft.

This protocol uses Win32 error codes as defined in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.2. Vendors SHOULD reuse those values with their indicated meaning. Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the future.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

The following table lists the [**universally unique identifier (UUID)**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid) value for the **authzr** interface specified in section [3.1](#Section_3.1).

| Parameter | Value | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UUID for authzr | 0b1c2170-5732-4e0e-8cd3-d9b16f3b84d7 | [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) |

# 3 Protocol Details

The Remote Authorization Protocol is used to approximate an [**access control decision**](#gt_access-control-decision) that would be made when a given principal attempts to access a hypothetical resource on a remote service that is protected with a given [**authorization policy**](#gt_authorization-policy).

All remote authorization methods return 0x00000000 on success; otherwise, they return a 32-bit, nonzero Win32 error code. For more details about Win32 error values, see [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md).

Unless otherwise specified, the pointer type for the RAZA RPC interface is pointer_default(unique). Method calls are received at a dynamically assigned endpoint ([MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.1.1.1). The endpoints for the Netlogon service are negotiated by the [**RPC endpoint**](#gt_rpc-endpoint) mapper ([MS-RPCE] section 2.1.1.1).

The client side of this protocol is simply a pass-through. That is, there are no additional timers or other states required on the client side of this protocol. Calls made by the higher-layer protocol or application are passed directly to the transport, and the results returned by the transport are passed directly back to the higher-layer protocol or application.

## 3.1 authzr Server Details

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The organization is provided to explain how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that specified in this document.

The RAZA server maintains one or more of the following abstract data types as abstract variables:

- **ImpersonationAccessToken (Public):** A Token/Authorization Context (see [MS-DTYP](#Section_2.2.1) section 2.5.2).
- **ClientContext:**A data structure containing the following members:
- **RPCClient:** An AUTHZR_HANDLE structure (section [2.2.1.1](#Section_2.2.1.1)).
- **AuthzContext:** An **ImpersonationAccessToken**.
Additionally, the RAZA server MUST maintain the following data structure:

- **ClientContextList:** A list of **ClientContext** objects.
<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>

**Return Values:**

If the function succeeds, the function MUST return 0x00000000.

If the function fails, it MUST return a nonzero error code value.

When a RAZA server receives this message, the server MUST perform the following:

If the *InfoClass* parameter is any value other than AuthzContextInfoUserClaims (13) or AuthzContextInfoDeviceClaims (14), the requested modification is not supported. When this happens, the RAZA server MUST set *ppContextInformation* to NULL and return FALSE.

The RAZA server MUST check the first element in the *pClaimOperations* array as indicated by *OperationCount* and perform operations as follows:

- If the value pointed to by the *pClaimOperations* parameter is **AUTHZ_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTE_OPERATION_NONE,** the RAZA server MUST return 0x00000000.
- If the value pointed to by the *pClaimsOperations* parameter is **AUTHZ_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTE_OPERATION_REPLACE_ALL,** the RAZA server MUST perform the following on the **ImpersonationAccessToken** in the **ClientContext** identified by the *ContextHandle*:
- Map the *InfoClass* parameter value to the corresponding **ImpersonationAccessToken** array according to the following table and replace it with the *pClaims* **Attribute** member array.
- Return 0x00000000 if the operation was a success; otherwise, return a nonzero error code.
- If the value pointed to by the *pClaimOperations* parameter is any other value of AUTHZ_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTE_OPERATION, perform the steps prescribed after the next paragraph.
The RAZA server MUST perform the following steps on each element in the *pClaimOperations* array as indicated by *OperationCount*:

- If the element is not the first element and the value is **AUTHZ_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTE_OPERATION_NONE** or **AUTHZ_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTE_OPERATION_REPLACE_ALL,** the RAZA server MUST return a nonzero error code. The case in which the first element is one of these values is described above.
- If the element is **AUTHZ_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTE_OPERATION_ADD,** append the corresponding element in the *pClaims* **Attributes** array to the **ImpersonationAccessToken** array identified according to the following table.
- If the element is **AUTHZ_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTE_OPERATION_DELETE**, search the **ImpersonationAccessToken** array identified according to the following table for a member whose **Value** member equals the **Value** member of the corresponding element of the **Attributes** array in the *pClaims* parameter. If one is found, delete that element from the identified **ImpersonationAccessToken** array and free any memory associated with that element.
- If the element is **AUTHZ_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTE_OPERATION_REPLACE,** search the **ImpersonationAccessToken** array identified according to the following table for a member whose **Value** member equals the **Value** member of the corresponding element of the **Attributes** array in the *pClaims* parameter.
- If the attribute is located, replace the **Values** member of the located attribute with the replacement **Values** member, which is located in the corresponding **Attributes** array element in the **Attributes** member of *pClaims*. If the replacement **Values** member does not exist, the located attribute is deleted.
- If the attribute is not located, it is added using the replacement **Values** member, which is located in the corresponding **Attributes** array element in the **Attributes** member of *pClaims*. If the replacement **Values** member does not exist, the operation is ignored and no failure is reported.

On receipt of this message, a RAZA server MUST complete the following process:

- If the InfoClass parameter contains any value other than AuthzContextInfoGroupSids (2) or AuthzContextInfoDeviceSids (12), or if the requested modification is not supported, the RAZA server MUST return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.
- The RAZA server MUST check the first element in the pSidOperations array as indicated by OperationCount.
- If the value pointed to by the pSidOperations parameter is AUTHZ_SID_OPERATION_NONE, the RAZA server must return 0x00000000.
- If the value pointed to by the pSidOperations parameter is AUTHZ_SID_OPERATION_REPLACE_ALL, the RAZA server MUST perform the following operations on the ImpersonationAccessToken in the ClientContext identified by the ContextHandle:
- Map the InfoClass parameter value to the corresponding ImpersonationAccessToken array according to the following table, and replace it with the pSids Groups member array.
- Return 0x00000000 if the operation is successful; otherwise, return a nonzero error code.
- If the value pointed to by the pSidOperations parameter is any other value of the **AUTHZ_SID_OPERATION** enumeration, continue with the following process.
The RAZA server MUST complete the following process for each element in the pSidOperations array as indicated by OperationCount:

- If the element is not the first element and the value is AUTHZ_SID_OPERATION_NONE or AUTHZ_SID_OPERATION_REPLACE_ALL, the RAZA server MUST return a nonzero error code. The case in which the first element is one of these values is described earlier.
- If the element is **AUTHZ_SID_OPERATION_ADD**, search the **ImpersonationAccessToken** array identified according to the following table for a member whose member equals the member of the corresponding element of the **Groups** array in the *pSids* parameter. If one is found, the RAZA server MUST return ERROR_GROUP_EXISTS, otherwise, append the corresponding element in the **Groups** array in the *pSids* parameter to the **ImpersonationAccessToken** array identified according to the following table. If the corresponding element of the **Groups** array in the *pSids* parameter does not exist, then RAZA server MUST fail with ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.
- If the element is AUTHZ_SID_OPERATION_DELETE, search the **ImpersonationAccessToken** array that is identified according to the following table for a member whose member equals the member of the corresponding element of the Groups array in the pSids parameter. If one is found, delete that element from the identified **ImpersonationAccessToken** array and free any memory that was associated with that element. If the search fails, the RAZA server MUST return ERROR_NOT_FOUND. If the corresponding element of the **Groups** array in the *pSids* parameter does not exist, then the RAZA server MUST fail with ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.
- If the element is AUTHZ_SID_OPERATION_REPLACE, search the ImpersonationAccessToken array identified according to the following table for a member whose member equals the member of the corresponding element of the Groups array in the pSids parameter.
- If the Sid is located, replace the member of the Sid located in the array with the replacement Sid, which is located in the corresponding Groups array element in the Groups member of the pSids parameter. If the corresponding replacement **Groups** member does not exist, then the RAZA server MUST fail with ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.
- If the Sid is not located, it is added using the replacement Sid, which is located in the corresponding Groups array element in the Groups member of the pSids parameter. If the corresponding replacement **Groups** member does not exist, then the RAZA server MUST fail with ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

Use of the RAZA protocol requires the client user to have access to read the user and claim information of security principals that the client is preforming authorization queries on.<2> It is recommended that access to the RAZA interface be limited to a subset of the principals who have access to read account information.

# 6 Appendix A: Full IDL

For ease of implementation, the full IDL is provided below, where "ms-dtyp.idl" refers to the IDL found in [MS-DTYP](#Section_2.2.1) Appendix A. The syntax uses the IDL syntax extensions defined in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) sections 2.2.4 and 3.1.1.5.1. For example, as noted in [MS-RPCE] section 2.2.4.9, a pointer_default declaration is not required and pointer_default(unique) is assumed.
