# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Group Policy: Audit Policy Configuration Protocol, which provides a mechanism for an administrator to control advanced audit policies on clients.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses [**LDAP**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) as its primary access protocol. [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) stores information about a variety of objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md). [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is either deployed as [**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**](#gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), which are both described in [MS-ADOD](../MS-ADOD/MS-ADOD.md): Active Directory Protocols Overview.

<a id="gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds"></a>
**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**: A directory service (DS) implemented by a [**domain controller (DC)**](#gt_domain-controller-dc). The DS provides a data store for objects that is distributed across multiple [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc). The [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) interoperate as peers to ensure that a local change to an object replicates correctly across [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc). AD DS is a deployment of [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

<a id="gt_active-directory-object"></a>
**Active Directory object**: A set of directory objects that are used within [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) as defined in [MS-ADTS] section 3.1.1. An [**Active Directory object**](#gt_active-directory-object) can be identified by a dsname. See also directory object.

<a id="gt_administrative-tool"></a>
**Administrative tool**: An implementation-specific tool, such as the Group Policy Management Console, that allows administrators to read and write [**policy settings**](#gt_policy-setting) from and to a [**Group Policy Object (GPO)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) and policy files. The Group Policy Administrative tool uses the Extension list of a GPO to determine which Administrative tool extensions are required to read settings from and write settings to the logical and physical components of a GPO.

<a id="gt_advanced-audit-policy"></a>
**advanced audit policy**: The global audit policy settings pertaining to auditing as described in this specification.

<a id="gt_attribute"></a>
**attribute**: A characteristic of some object or entity, typically encoded as a name/value pair.

<a id="gt_audit-policy"></a>
**audit policy**: The global audit policy settings pertaining to auditing as described in [MS-GPSB](#Section_5) section 2.2.4.

<a id="gt_augmented-backus-naur-form-abnf"></a>
**Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)**: A modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), commonly used by Internet specifications. ABNF notation balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power. ABNF differs from standard BNF in its definitions and uses of naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges. For more information, see [[RFC5234]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096).

<a id="gt_client-side-extension-guid-cse-guid"></a>
**client-side extension GUID (CSE GUID)**: A [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) that enables a specific client-side extension on the Group Policy client to be associated with policy data that is stored in the logical and physical components of a [**Group Policy Object (GPO)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) on the Group Policy server, for that particular extension.

<a id="gt_computer-scoped-group-policy-object-path"></a>
**computer-scoped Group Policy Object path**: A scoped Group Policy Object (GPO) path that ends in "\Machine".

<a id="gt_domain"></a>
**domain**: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a [**domain controller (DC)**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) service. The domain controller provides authentication of members, creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD](../MS-AUTHSOD/MS-AUTHSOD.md) section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS].

<a id="gt_domain-controller-dc"></a>
**domain controller (DC)**: The service, running on a server, that implements [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory), or the server hosting this service. The service hosts the data store for objects and interoperates with other [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) to ensure that a local change to an object replicates correctly across all [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc). When [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is operating as [**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**](#gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds), the [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) contains full NC replicas of the configuration naming context (config NC), schema naming context (schema NC), and one of the domain NCs in its forest. If the [**AD DS**](#gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds) [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) is a global catalog server (GC server), it contains partial NC replicas of the remaining domain NCs in its forest. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5.2 and [MS-ADTS]. When [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is operating as Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), several AD LDS [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) can run on one server. When [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is operating as [**AD DS**](#gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds), only one [**AD DS**](#gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds) [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) can run on one server. However, several AD LDS [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) can coexist with one [**AD DS**](#gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds) [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) on one server. The AD LDS [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) contains full NC replicas of the config NC and the schema NC in its forest. The domain controller is the server side of Authentication Protocol Domain Support [MS-APDS](../MS-APDS/MS-APDS.md).

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_group-policy"></a>
**Group Policy**: A mechanism that allows the implementer to specify managed configurations for users and computers in an [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) service environment.

<a id="gt_group-policy-object-gpo"></a>
**Group Policy Object (GPO)**: A collection of administrator-defined specifications of the policy settings that can be applied to groups of computers in a domain. Each GPO includes two elements: an object that resides in the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) for the domain, and a corresponding file system subdirectory that resides on the sysvol DFS share of the Group Policy server for the domain.

<a id="gt_group-policy-server"></a>
**Group Policy server**: A server holding a database of [**Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) that can be retrieved by other machines. The [**Group Policy server**](#gt_group-policy-server) must be a [**domain controller (DC)**](#gt_domain-controller-dc).

<a id="gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap"></a>
**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**: The primary access protocol for [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory). Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an industry-standard protocol, established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which allows users to query and update information in a directory service (DS), as described in [MS-ADTS]. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol can be either version 2 [[RFC1777]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90290) or version 3 [[RFC3377]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91337).

<a id="gt_policy-setting"></a>
**policy setting**: A statement of the possible behaviors of an element of a domain member computer's behavior that can be configured by an administrator.

<a id="gt_security-identifier-sid"></a>
**security identifier (SID)**: An identifier for security principals that is used to identify an account or a group. Conceptually, the [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is composed of an account authority portion (typically a [**domain**](#gt_domain)) and a smaller integer representing an identity relative to the account authority, termed the relative identifier (RID). The [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) format is specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.4.2; a string representation of [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2 and [MS-AZOD](../MS-AZOD/MS-AZOD.md) section 1.1.1.2.

<a id="gt_share"></a>
**share**: A resource offered by a Common Internet File System (CIFS) server for access by CIFS clients over the network. A [**share**](#gt_share) typically represents a directory tree and its included files (referred to commonly as a "disk share" or "file share") or a printer (a "print share"). If the information about the [**share**](#gt_share) is saved in persistent store (for example, Windows registry) and reloaded when a file server is restarted, then the [**share**](#gt_share) is referred to as a "sticky share". Some [**share**](#gt_share) names are reserved for specific functions and are referred to as special [**shares**](#gt_share): IPC$, reserved for interprocess communication, ADMIN$, reserved for remote administration, and A$, B$, C$ (and other local disk names followed by a dollar sign), assigned to local disk devices.

<a id="gt_system-access-control-list-sacl"></a>
**system access control list (SACL)**: An access control list (ACL) that controls the generation of audit messages for attempts to access a securable object. The ability to get or set an object's [**SACL**](#gt_system-access-control-list-sacl) is controlled by a privilege typically held only by system administrators.

<a id="gt_ticket-granting-ticket-tgt"></a>
**ticket-granting ticket (TGT)**: A special type of ticket that can be used to obtain other tickets. The TGT is obtained after the initial authentication in the Authentication Service (AS) exchange; thereafter, users do not need to present their credentials, but can use the TGT to obtain subsequent tickets.

<a id="gt_token"></a>
**token**: A set of rights and privileges for a given user.

<a id="gt_tool-extension-guid-or-administrative-plug-in-guid"></a>
**tool extension GUID or administrative plug-in GUID**: A GUID defined separately for each of the user policy settings and computer policy settings that associates a specific administrative tool plug-in with a set of policy settings that can be stored in a [**Group Policy Object (GPO)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo).

<a id="gt_universal-naming-convention-unc"></a>
**Universal Naming Convention (UNC)**: A string format that specifies the location of a resource. For more information, see [MS-DTYP] section 2.2.57.

<a id="gt_utf-8"></a>
**UTF-8**: A byte-oriented standard for encoding Unicode characters, defined in the Unicode standard. Unless specified otherwise, this term refers to the UTF-8 encoding form specified in [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) section 3.9.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The Group Policy: Audit Configuration Extension to the Group Policy: Core Protocol [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) enables [**advanced audit policies**](#gt_4b2ac477-f6e8-4dc8-917e-d5459a35cd2a) to be distributed to multiple clients so that these clients can enforce the policies in accordance with the intentions of the administrator.

<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 Background

The Group Policy: Core Protocol, as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md), allows clients to discover and retrieve [**policy settings**](#gt_policy-setting) created by administrators of a [**domain**](#gt_domain). These settings are persisted within [**Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) that are assigned to Policy Target accounts in [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory). Policy Target accounts are either computer accounts or user accounts in Active Directory. Each client uses [**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**](#gt_lightweight-directory-access-protocol-ldap) to determine what GPOs are applicable to it by consulting the [**Active Directory objects**](#gt_active-directory-object) corresponding to both its computer account and the user accounts of any users logging on to the client computer.

On each client, each GPO is interpreted and acted upon by client plug-ins. The client plug-ins that are responsible for a given GPO are specified using an attribute on the GPO. This attribute specifies a list of [**globally unique identifier (GUID)**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) pairs. The first GUID of each pair is referred to as a [**client-side extension GUID (CSE GUID)**](#gt_client-side-extension-guid-cse-guid). The second GUID of each pair is referred to as a [**tool extension GUID**](#gt_88ad7745-bee6-47f7-ae98-6fac7c5ef330).

For each GPO that is applicable to a client, the client consults the CSE GUID listed in the GPO to determine what client plug-in on the client will handle the GPO. The client then invokes the client plug-in to handle the GPO.

A client plug-in uses the contents of the GPO to retrieve settings specific to the client plug-in in a manner specific to the client plug-in. After the client plug-in-specific settings are retrieved, the client plug-in uses those settings to perform the client plug-in-specific processing.

<a id="Section_1.3.2"></a>
### 1.3.2 Audit Configuration Extension Overview

[**Advanced audit policies**](#gt_4b2ac477-f6e8-4dc8-917e-d5459a35cd2a) contain settings that enable the underlying audit subsystem to determine which activities to monitor and log in the security event log. Advanced audit policies contain three main types of settings:

- Audit subcategory settings
- Audit options
- Global object access policy
The following major steps are involved in advanced audit policy configuration:

- Advanced audit policy authoring
- Advanced audit policy assignment
- Advanced audit policy distribution
Advanced audit policy authoring is enabled through an [**administrative tool**](#gt_administrative-tool) for the Group Policy: Core Protocol specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) with an administrative-side plug-in for behavior specific to this protocol. The plug-in allows an administrator to author advanced audit policies within an implementation-specific tool providing a graphical user interface. The plug-in then saves the advanced audit policies into files with a format specified in this document, and stores them on a file [**share**](#gt_share) that is accessible by file access protocol sequences as described in [MS-FASOD](#Section_1.3).

Advanced audit policy assignment is performed by the Group Policy: Core Protocol administrative tool, which constructs [**GPOs**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo), as specified in [MS-GPOL] section 2.2.8.1. Each GPO contains a reference to the network path using the [**Universal Naming Convention (UNC)**](#gt_universal-naming-convention-unc) where the advanced audit policy files generated by the protocol administrative plug-in need to be fetched from using file access protocol sequences.

Advanced audit policy distribution involves a corresponding protocol-specific [**Group Policy**](#gt_group-policy) plug-in on the client machine, which is invoked to process any GPO that refers to advanced audit policy settings. The advanced audit policy protocol client-side plug-in locates the advanced audit policy as specified in section [3.1.4](#Section_3.2.4), transfers the advanced audit policy files by using file access protocol sequences, and then uses the advanced audit policy files to configure the client's advanced audit policy, audit options, and global object access auditing settings.

<a id="Section_1.3.2.1"></a>
#### 1.3.2.1 Audit Subcategory Settings

The advanced audit policy allows administrators to select only the behaviors to monitor and to exclude audit results for behaviors that are of no concern to them or behaviors that create an excessive number of log entries. These settings are grouped into the following nine main audit categories containing the audit subcategories listed here:

For more information about audit subcategories, see section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1).

<a id="Section_1.3.2.2"></a>
#### 1.3.2.2 Audit Options

Audit options are settings that enable or disable functionality of the audit subsystem. These settings include crashing the system on audit failures, full privilege auditing, auditing of base objects, and auditing of base directories.

For more information about audit options, see section [2.2.2](#Section_1.3).

<a id="Section_1.3.2.3"></a>
#### 1.3.2.3 Global Object Access Policy

The global object access policy contains a set of system access control lists that are applied to whole resource managers like the File System and Registry.

For more information about global object access policy, see section [2.2.3](#Section_1.3).

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol depends on Group Policy: Core Protocol specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) to provide a list of applicable GPOs. It also transmits Group Policy settings and instructions between the client and the [**Group Policy server**](#gt_group-policy-server) by reading and writing files. See [MS-FASOD](#Section_1.3) for an overview of file access services concepts. The following diagram illustrates these relationships.

![Group Policy: Audit Configuration Extension protocol relationship diagram](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Group Policy: Audit Configuration Extension protocol relationship diagram

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The prerequisites for Group Policy: Audit Configuration Extension are the same as those for the Group Policy: Core Protocol [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md).

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

Group Policy: Audit Configuration Extension is only applicable within the Group Policy framework.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

None.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

Group Policy: Audit Configuration Extension defines CSE GUID and tool extension GUID, as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) (section 1.8). The following table shows the assignments.

## 2.1 Transport

The Group Policy: Audit Configuration Extension requires file access as specified for use in the Group Policy: Core Protocol [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md). All messages MUST be exchanged over file access protocols between the client and server, as specified in section [2.2](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md).

The Group Policy: Core Protocol uses this protocol's [**CSE GUID**](#gt_client-side-extension-guid-cse-guid) and [**tool extension GUID**](#gt_88ad7745-bee6-47f7-ae98-6fac7c5ef330) values to invoke this protocol only to access [**GPOs**](#gt_group-policy-object-gpo) that require processing by this protocol.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

Messages exchanged in the Group Policy: Audit Configuration Extension correspond to advanced audit policy files transferred by using file access protocol sequences as described in [MS-FASOD](#Section_1.3). The protocol is driven through the exchange of these messages, as specified in section [3](../MS-FASOD/MS-FASOD.md).

All advanced audit policy files processed by the Group Policy: Audit Configuration Extension are [**UTF-8**](#gt_utf-8) encoded and based on the following file syntax.

CSVFile = Header SubcategorySettings AuditOptions GlobalObjectAccessAuditSettings

Header = "Machine Name,Policy Target,Subcategory,Subcategory GUID,Inclusion Setting,Exclusion Setting,Setting Value" LineBreak

The preceding syntax is given in the [**Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)**](#gt_augmented-backus-naur-form-abnf) grammar, as specified in [[RFC4234]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90462) and as augmented by the following rules.

LineBreak = CRLF

String = *(ALPHANUM / %d47 / %d45 / %d58 / %d59)

StringWithSpaces = String / String Wsp StringWithSpaces

QuotedString = DQUOTE *(%x20-21 / %x23-7E) DQUOTE

Wsp = *WSP

ALPHANUM = ALPHA / DIGIT

GUID = %x7B time-low hyphen time-mid hyphen

time-high-and-version hyphen

clock-seq-and_reserved

clock-seq-low hyphen node %x7D

time-low = hexOctet hexOctet hexOctet hexOctet

time-mid = hexOctet hexOctet

time-high-and-version = hexOctet hexOctet

clock-seq-and-reserved = hexOctet

clock-seq-low = hexOctet

node = hexOctet hexOctet hexOctet

hexOctet hexOctet hexOctet

hexOctet = hexDigit hexDigit

hexDigit = digit / a / b / c / d / e / f

digit = "0" / "1" | "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" /

"8" / "9"

hyphen = "-"

a = "a" / "A"

b = "b" / "B"

c = "c" / "C"

d = "d" / "D"

e = "e" / "E"

f = "f" / "F"

### 2.2.1 Subcategory Settings

This section defines settings that enable an administrator to set the subcategory settings for an advanced audit policy. The syntax for the entries in this category MUST be as follows.

SubcategorySettings = SubcategorySetting / SubcategorySetting / SubcategorySetting

SubcategorySetting = MachineName "," PolicyTarget "," Subcategory "," SubcategoryGUID "," InclusionSetting "," ExclusionSetting "," SettingValue LineBreak

<a id="Section_2.2.1.1"></a>
#### 2.2.1.1 Policy Target

This section defines the possible values for the PolicyTarget [**attribute**](#gt_attribute), which enables an administrator to specify whether to set the audit subcategory for a system advanced audit policy or a specific user. The syntax for the entries in this category MUST be as follows.

PolicyTarget = "System" / UserSID

The value of PolicyTarget MUST be one of the following:

- A value of "System": Indicates that this is a system audit subcategory setting.
- A UserSID: Indicates that this is a per-user audit subcategory setting.
UserSID is the string representation of the [**security identifier (SID)**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) of a user account. The syntax for the entries in this category MUST be as follows.

UserSID = String

The UserSID string MUST use the standard S-*R*-*I*-*S*-*S*... format for SID strings, as specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) (section 2.4.2).<1>

<a id="Section_2.2.1.2"></a>
#### 2.2.1.2 Subcategory and SubcategoryGUID

This section defines how the Subcategory and SubcategoryGUID values are used by the audit configuration client-side plug-in.

The Subcategory field is for user reference only and is ignored when the advanced audit policy is applied by the audit configuration client-side plug-in.

The syntax for the entries in this category MUST be as follows.

Subcategory = StringWithSpaces / QuotedString

SubcategoryGUID = GUID

The SubcategoryGUID allows administrators to identify audit subcategories to enable or disable in the client's system or per-user advanced audit policy. For more information about enabling or disabling audit subcategories, see section [2.2.1.3](#Section_2.2.1.3).

The following table provides an explanation for the valid **SubcategoryGUID** values.

<a id="Section_2.2.1.3"></a>
#### 2.2.1.3 Inclusion Setting, Exclusion Setting, and Setting Value

This section defines settings that enable an administrator to define whether to add or remove a subcategory from the client advanced audit policy.

The possible value of these attributes depends whether the subcategory audit setting policy target is "System" or a specific user or group.

<a id="Section_2.2.1.3.1"></a>
##### 2.2.1.3.1 Inclusion Setting, Exclusion Setting, and SettingValue for System Audit Subcategories

This section defines the syntax for the InclusionSetting, ExclusionSetting, and SettingValue attributes when the PolicyTarget attribute is set to "System".

The syntax for the entries in this category MUST be as follows.

InclusionSetting-SA = "Success" / "Failure" / "Success and Failure" / "No Auditing" / "Not Specified"

ExclusionSetting-SA = ""

SettingValue-SA = 1*DIGIT

Please note that the element names above have a postfix of "-SA" to differentiate them from per-user audit settings which have a postfix of "-UA".

The value of SettingValue MUST be one of the following:

- A value of "0": Indicates that this audit subcategory setting is unchanged.
- A value of "1": Indicates that this audit subcategory setting is set to Success Audits Only.
- A value of "2": Indicates that this audit subcategory setting is set to Failure Audits Only.
- A value of "3": Indicates that this audit subcategory setting is set to Success and Failure Audits.
- A value of "4": Indicates that this audit subcategory setting is set to None.
**Note** The value of InclusionSetting is for user readability only and is ignored when the advanced audit policy is applied by the audit configuration client-side plug-in.

<a id="Section_2.2.1.3.2"></a>
##### 2.2.1.3.2 Inclusion Setting, Exclusion Setting, and SettingValue for Per-User Audit Subcategories

This section defines the syntax for the InclusionSetting, ExclusionSetting, and SettingValue attributes when the PolicyTarget attribute is set to a specific user or group SID.

The syntax for the entries in this category MUST be as follows.

InclusionSetting-UA = "SettingValueText"

ExclusionSetting-UA = SettingValueText

SettingValueText-UA = "Success" / "Failure" / "Success and Failure" / "No Auditing" / "Not Specified"

SettingValue-UA = 1*DIGIT

Note that the element names above have a postfix of "-UA" to differentiate them from System advanced audit policy settings, which have a postfix of "-SA".

The attribute **SettingValueText** is for user readability only and is ignored when the advanced audit policy is applied by the audit configuration client-side plug-in.

The value of SettingValue MUST be one of the following:

- A value of "0": Indicates that this audit subcategory setting is unchanged.
- A value of "16": Indicates that this audit subcategory setting is set to None.
- A decimal numerical value created by combining the following bits.
| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Include Success**: This bit will cause a **Success** Audit to be generated even if not specified by the system advanced audit policy. | 1 | 0x01 |
| **Exclude Success**: This bit will cause a **Success** Audit to be suppressed regardless of the system advanced audit policy. This setting is not honored for users who are members of the Administrators local group. | 2 | 0x02 |
| **Include Failure**: This bit will cause a **Failure** Audit to be generated even if not specified by the system advanced audit policy. | 3 | 0x04 |
| **Exclude Failure**: This bit will cause a **Failure** Audit to be suppressed regardless of the system advanced audit policy. This setting is not honored for users who are members of the Administrators local group. | 4 | 0x08 |

**Note** Include has a higher precedence than exclude:

- If **Include Success** and **Exclude Success** bits are set**, Include Success** is used and Exclude Success is ignored.
- If **Include Failure** and **Exclude Failure** bits are set, **Include Failure** is used and Exclude Failure is ignored.<6>
<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 Audit Options

This section defines settings that enable an administrator to set the audit options for an advanced audit policy. The syntax for the entries in this category MUST be as follows.

AuditOptions = MachineName ",,Option:" AuditOptionType ",," AuditOptionValueText ",," AuditOptionValue

<a id="Section_2.2.2.1"></a>
#### 2.2.2.1 Audit Option Type

This section defines the advanced audit options that are part of the audit policy. The syntax for the entries in this category MUST be as follows.

AuditOptionType = String

The value of AuditOptionType MUST be one of the following:

| AuditOptionType | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| CrashOnAuditFail | This audit option specifies whether the client shuts down if it is unable to log security events. If this security setting is enabled, it causes the client to stop if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason. |
| FullPrivilegeAuditing | This audit option specifies whether the client generates an event when one or more of these privileges are assigned to a user security token: AssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege AuditPrivilege BackupPrivilege CreateTokenPrivilege DebugPrivilege EnableDelegationPrivilege ImpersonatePrivilege LoadDriverPrivilege RestorePrivilege SecurityPrivilege SystemEnvironmentPrivilege TakeOwnershipPrivilege TcbPrivilege |
| AuditBaseObjects | This security setting specifies whether to audit the access of global system objects. If this audit option is enabled, it causes system objects, such as mutexes, events, semaphores, and DOS devices, to be created with a default [**system access control list (SACL)**](#gt_system-access-control-list-sacl). Only named objects are given a SACLs; SACL are not given to objects without names. If the Kernel Object audit subcategory is also enabled, access to these system objects is audited. |
| AuditBaseDirectories | The AuditBaseDirectories option specifies that named kernel objects (such as mutexes and semaphores) are to be given SACLs when they are created. AuditBaseDirectories affects container objects while AuditBaseObjects affects objects that cannot contain other objects. |

<a id="Section_2.2.2.2"></a>
#### 2.2.2.2 Audit Option Value

This section defines the possible values corresponding to the audit options. The syntax for the entries in this category MUST be as follows.

AuditOptionValueText = "Enabled" / "Disabled"

AuditOptionValue = 1*DIGIT

**Note** The **AuditOptionValueText** field is for user reference only and is ignored when the advanced audit policy is applied by the audit configuration client-side plug-in.

The value of AuditOptionValue MUST be one of the following:

| AuditOptionValue | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| "0" | The audit option is disabled. |
| "1" | The audit option is enabled. |

<a id="Section_2.2.3"></a>
### 2.2.3 Global Object Access Audit Settings

This section defines settings that enable an administrator to set the global object access auditing settings for an advanced audit policy.

Global object access audit settings are used by administrators to define system access control lists (SACLs) that apply dynamically to every object in a specific resource manager. When a global object access audit setting is defined, the auditing system combines the SACL defined in the security descriptor that is being accessed with the global object access SACL for the corresponding resource manager. An event is logged if either of the two SACLs (object SACL or global SACL) determines that the activity is to be audited.

The syntax for the entries in this category MUST be as follows.

GlobalObjectAccessAuditSettings = MachineName ",," ResourceGlobalSaclType ",,,," GlobalSACL

<a id="Section_2.2.3.1"></a>
#### 2.2.3.1 Resource Global SACL Type

This section defines the use of the ResourceGlobalSaclType attribute. The syntax for the entries in this category MUST be as follows.

ResourceGlobalSaclType = "FileGlobalSacl" / "RegistryGlobalSacl"

The value of ResourceGlobalSaclType MUST be one of the following:

| ResourceGlobalSaclType | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| "FileGlobalSacl" | Defines a global SACL for the **File System** resource manager. |
| "RegistryGlobalSacl" | Defines a global SACL for the **Registry** resource manager. |

<a id="Section_2.2.3.2"></a>
#### 2.2.3.2 Global System Access Control List (SACL)

This section defines the use of the GlobalSACL attribute. The syntax for the entries in this category MUST be as follows.

GlobalSACL = SDDLString

SDDLString = String

The GlobalSACL attribute MUST be in the form of an SDDL encoding of a SACL of a security descriptor. For more information, see [[MSDN-SDDL]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90124).

<a id="Section_2.2.4"></a>
### 2.2.4 Machine Name

This section defines the use of the machine name, used on different sections of the advanced audit policy. The syntax for the entries in this category MUST be as follows.

MachineName = String / QuotedString

The machine name is given for user reference and is ignored when the audit configuration client-side plug-in applies an advanced audit policy.

# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Audit Configuration Protocol Administrative-Side Plug-in Details

The audit configuration protocol administrative-side plug-in participates in the advanced audit policy authoring and assignment steps, as specified in section [2](#Section_2). The advanced audit policy MUST be stored as a text file by using a .csv format, as specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2). The advanced audit policies MUST be stored in a location accessible by using file access protocol sequences.

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

The audit configuration protocol administrative-side plug-in maintains no state. It loads all the settings, as specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2), in memory.

The administrative-side plug-in is used, through the implementation-specific tool providing a graphical user interface, to interact with the advanced audit policy file, as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md). The plug-in determines the physical location of a desired policy, creates a new policy, or opens an existing policy as appropriate, and displays it to the administrator. After the administrator modifies the policy, the changes MUST be propagated back into the policy at the specified location.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The process for reading the settings from the GPO for administrative purposes MUST be the same as those as specified in section [3.2.5](#Section_3.2.5), steps 1-3.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

The administrative-side plug-in is triggered when an administrator starts an [**administrative tool**](#gt_administrative-tool). The plug-in displays the current settings to the administrator, and when the administrator requests a change in settings, the plug-in updates the stored configuration appropriately as specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2).

For both viewing and editing settings, the administrative-side plug-in MUST first open the specified GPO to fetch its network path. The plug-in MUST attempt to read an audit.csv file with the settings from the following location (for viewing) or write to the following location (for editing): <gpo path>\Microsoft\Windows NT\Audit\audit.csv (where <gpo path> is the [**computer-scoped Group Policy Object path**](#gt_computer-scoped-group-policy-object-path), if the computer settings are being viewed or updated).

File reads and writes MUST be performed, as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 3.3. File names and paths SHOULD be regarded as case-insensitive. If the copy fails, the administrative-side plug-in MUST display to the user that the operation failed.

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The administrative-side plug-in reads extension-specific data from the remote storage location and passes that information to an implementation-specific tool that provides a graphical user interface to display the current settings to an administrator.

The administrative-side plug-in creates the advanced audit policy file in the remote location specified in section [3.1.4](#Section_3.2.4) if the file does not exist. The administrative-side plug-in writes the extension-specific configuration data to the remote storage location if the administrator makes any changes to the existing configuration.

After every creation, modification, or deletion that affects an audit policy file on SYSVOL, the administrative-side plug-in MUST invoke the Group Policy Extension Update task, as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 3.3.4.4.

<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>
### 3.1.6 Timer Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.7"></a>
### 3.1.7 Other Local Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.2"></a>
## 3.2 Advanced Audit Policy Configuration Client-Side Plug-in Details

The advanced audit policy configuration client-side plug-in interacts with the Group Policy framework, as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 3.2. This plug-in MUST receive the advanced audit policy and modify the appropriate part of the Abstract Data Model (ADM) for each element in the policy as specified in this section.

<a id="Section_3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This section defines a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to explain how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with what is described in this document.

<a id="Section_3.2.1.1"></a>
#### 3.2.1.1 Policy Setting State

The client-side plug-in persistent state consists of the 4 sections below. The location where this state is stored is specific to each implementation.

- System Advanced Audit Policy:
A list of records, each with a record identifier (subcategory GUID). In addition to the key, each record has an audit setting value that defines the audit behavior for the subcategory. Subcategory settings are specified in section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1).

- Per-User Advanced Audit Policy:
A list of records, each with a user or group SID, a subcategory GUID, and an audit setting value that overrides the system audit behavior for the subcategory for the user or group.

- Audit Options:
A list of records, each with an audit option type and a setting value. Audit options are specified in section [2.2.2](#Section_1.3).

- Global Object Access Auditing:
Consists of two persistent [**SACL**](#gt_system-access-control-list-sacl)-valued data elements: FileGlobalSacl and RegistryGlobalSacl. This is used to store the global object access audit settings used by administrators to define system access control lists (SACLs) that apply dynamically to every object in a specific resource manager. For more details, see section [2.2.3](#Section_1.3).

<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

When invoked by the Group Policy framework with a list of one or more applicable GPOs, the audit configuration protocol client-side plug-in MUST do the following: locate all the advanced audit policy files within those GPOs, copy the policies to the local machine, read the policies, and apply them as specified in section [3.2.5](#Section_3.2.5).

Locating advanced audit policy files MUST be done by using the Group Policy: Core Protocol, as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 3.2.5.1, and the LDAP search protocol, as specified in [[RFC2251]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90325) section 4.5. The policy files MUST be copied and read by using file access protocol sequences.

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

This plug-in implements one higher-layer triggered event: [Process Group Policy](#Section_3.2.4.1).

<a id="Section_3.2.4.1"></a>
#### 3.2.4.1 Process Group Policy

The plug-in implements the Process Group Policy abstract event interface, as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 3.2.4.1. The plug-in does not make use of the *Deleted GPOs*, the flags, or the security tokens arguments. When the event is triggered, the audit configuration protocol client-side plug-in MUST take the actions described in the section [3.2.5](#Section_3.2.5).

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The audit configuration protocol client-side extension MUST be invoked by the Group Policy framework whenever applicable GPOs need to be processed, as specified in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 3.2.5.1. On such an event, the audit configuration protocol client-side plug-in MUST take the actions described in this section.

When invoked, the audit configuration protocol client-side plug-in expects a list of applicable GPOs in the "New or changed GPOs" parameter. It MUST then go through this list and, for each GPO, locate and retrieve the contained advanced audit policy. For each of those GPOs, one file with the format (as specified in section [2.2](#Section_2.2)) MUST be copied from the Group Policy: Core Protocol server. If any file cannot be read, the plug-in MUST log information about the failure and continue to copy files for other GPOs.

For each GPO, the advanced audit policy configuration client-side plug-in MUST generate the following file access sequences to copy the file locally:

| Sequence | Description |
| --- | --- |
| File Open from Client to Server | The plug-in MUST attempt to open the file specified by <scoped gpo path>\Microsoft\Windows NT\Audit\audit.csv. |
| File Read Sequences | One or more file reads MUST be done to read the entire content of the opened file or until an error occurs. |
| File Close | A file close operation MUST be performed. |

The file MUST be parsed according to the format specified in section 2.2. If the file does not conform to that format, the entire configuration operation MUST be ignored. If the file does conform to that format, the settings MUST be applied to the corresponding audit parameters on the system.

After all the advanced audit policies are retrieved, each policy MUST be opened and the contained advanced audit policy settings MUST be extracted and applied for each ADM element corresponding to section 2.2.

When reading the advanced audit policy configuration file, the client-side extension follows the logical flow mentioned below.

If the "Policy Target" column value is empty AND if the "Subcategory" column value indicates FileGlobalSacl, process the "Setting Value" column value in the following way:

- Convert the "Setting Value" column value into a security descriptor based on the format defined in [[MSDN-SDDL]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90124).
- For each Audit Access Control Entry (ACE) in the SACL of the security descriptor extracted in the previous step, add it to the **FileGlobalSacl** ADM variable if it doesn't already exist.
If the "Policy Target" column value is empty AND if the "Subcategory" column value indicates RegistryGlobalSacl, process the "Setting Value" column value in the following way:

- Convert the "Setting Value" column value into a security descriptor based on the format defined in [MSDN-SDDL].
- For each Audit Access Control Entry (ACE) in the SACL of the security descriptor extracted in the previous step, add it to the **RegistryGlobalSacl** ADM variable if it doesn't already exist.<7>
If the "Policy Target" column value is empty, then verify that the "Subcategory" column value is one of those specified in section [2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.1), Audit Option Type. Once verified, store the "Setting Value" column value in the **AuditOptionValue** field of the corresponding AuditOptionType in the **Audit Options** ADM variable as specified in section [3.2.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1).

If the "Exclusion Setting" column value is empty, then verify that the "Subcategory GUID" column value is one of those specified in [Subcategory and SubcategoryGUID (section 2.2.1.2)](#Section_2.2.1.2). Once verified, store the "Setting Value" column value in the audit setting value field of the corresponding subcategory GUID in the **System Advanced Audit Policy** ADM variable as specified in section 3.2.1.1.

If both the "Policy Target" and the "Exclusion Setting" column values are not empty, then verify that the "Subcategory GUID" column value is one of those specified in section Subcategory and SubcategoryGUID (section 2.2.1.2). Once verified, for the user identified by the "Policy Target" column value, store the "Setting Value" column value in the audit setting value field of the corresponding subcategory GUID in the **Per-User Advanced Audit Policy** ADM variable as specified in section 3.2.1.1.

# 5 Security

<a id="Section_5.1"></a>
## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

Setting both the advanced audit policies (as described in this document) and the event audit policies (as described in [MS-GPSB](#Section_5) section 2.2.4) on the same client can lead to inconsistent behavior. Therefore, if the advanced audit policies are used on a client, it is recommended that the registry value MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\SCENoApplyLegacyAuditPolicy be set to 1, using the mechanism described in [MS-GPSB] section 2.2.5. This avoids the conflict by preventing the event audit policies from being applied on the client.

## 5.2 Index of Security Parameters

<a id="Section_5.2.1"></a>
### 5.2.1 Security Parameters Affecting Behavior of the Protocol

| Security Parameter | Explanation of setting |
| --- | --- |
| MaxNoGPOListChangesInterval [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md) section 3.2.1.24 | When the value of the MaxNoGPOListChangesInterval for a particular client-side extension is set (by local implementation-specific means) to a nonzero integer value, the Group Policy client will invoke the extension after MaxNoGPOListChangesInterval minutes, even if the policy has not changed since the last invocation of the extension. This setting ensures that the advanced audit policy settings created by the administrator of a domain are reapplied on the client after MaxNoGPOListChangesInterval minutes. This limits the amount of time that the local and central advanced audit policy settings could be out of sync because of local modifications to the policy.<8> |

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 2.2.1.1: In Windows, audit settings associated with group [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) strings are ignored by the client.

<2> Section 2.2.1.2: In Windows, this subcategory also audits the following events:

- Startup and shutdown of the Windows Firewall.
- Security policy processing by the Windows Firewall.
<3> Section 2.2.1.2: User/Device Claims audit subcategory is not implemented in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2.

<4> Section 2.2.1.2: PNP Activity is not implemented in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2.

<5> Section 2.2.1.2: Group Membership is not implemented in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2.

<6> Section 2.2.1.3.2: If any subcategory in the Per-User Advanced Audit Policy section is defined for a given user or group in Windows, the value **Include Failure** (0x4) is used as default for all the rest of the audit subcategories that are not defined for that user after all the applicable policies are processed. The **Include Failure** setting will cause a **Failure** Audit to be generated even if not specified by the system advanced audit policy.

<7> Section 3.2.5: In Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, individual Audit ACEs from different GPOs are not merged into a single SACL; instead the final value of the FileGlobalSacl, as well as the RegistryGlobalSacl ADM variables, come from the GPO with the highest precedence (as described in [MS-GPOL](../MS-GPOL/MS-GPOL.md)) where the setting is defined.

<8> Section 5.2.1: In Windows, the value of MaxNoGPOListChangesInterval is 0x3c0 (960 minutes) for the advanced audit policy client-side extension.
