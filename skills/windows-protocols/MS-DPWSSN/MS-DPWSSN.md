# 1 Introduction

This document specifies an extension to the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) to allow the negotiation of message sizes between a client and a service for a specific message transaction. This extension to an existing protocol does not define new operations, but instead defines [**XML Schema**](#gt_xml-schema-xsd) that may be added to existing messages to allow clients and services to properly configure themselves.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_client"></a>
**client**: The sending endpoint of a web services request message, and receiver of any resulting web services response message.

<a id="gt_device"></a>
**device**: The Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) term for a special instance of a service that is discoverable and contains other services with metadata describing those services.

<a id="gt_endpoint"></a>
**endpoint**: In the context of a web service, a network target to which a SOAP message can be addressed. See [[WSADDR]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=113065).

<a id="gt_service"></a>
**service**: The receiving endpoint of a [**web services**](#gt_web-service) request message, and sender of any resulting [**web services**](#gt_web-service) response message.

<a id="gt_soap-action"></a>
**SOAP action**: The HTTP request header field used to indicate the intent of the SOAP request, using a URI value. See [[SOAP1.1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90520) section 6.1.1 for more information.

<a id="gt_soap-header"></a>
**SOAP header**: A mechanism for implementing extensions to a [**SOAP message**](#gt_soap-message) in a decentralized manner without prior agreement between the communicating parties. See [[SOAP1.2-1/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94664) section 5.2 for more information.

<a id="gt_soap-message"></a>
**SOAP message**: An XML document consisting of a mandatory SOAP envelope, an optional [**SOAP header**](#gt_soap-header), and a mandatory SOAP body. See [SOAP1.2-1/2007] section 5 for more information.

<a id="gt_web-service"></a>
**web service**: A unit of application logic that provides data and services to other applications and can be called by using standard Internet transport protocols such as HTTP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), or File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Web services can perform functions that range from simple requests to complicated business processes.

<a id="gt_web-services-description-language-wsdl"></a>
**Web Services Description Language (WSDL)**: An XML format for describing network services as a set of endpoints that operate on messages that contain either document-oriented or procedure-oriented information. The operations and messages are described abstractly and are bound to a concrete network protocol and message format in order to define an endpoint. Related concrete endpoints are combined into abstract endpoints, which describe a network service. WSDL is extensible, which allows the description of endpoints and their messages regardless of the message formats or network protocols that are used.

<a id="gt_xml-namespace"></a>
**XML namespace**: A collection of names that is used to identify elements, types, and attributes in XML documents identified in a URI reference [[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453). A combination of XML namespace and local name allows XML documents to use elements, types, and attributes that have the same names but come from different sources. For more information, see [[XMLNS-2ED]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90602).

<a id="gt_xml-schema-xsd"></a>
**XML Schema (XSD)**: A language that defines the elements, attributes, namespaces, and data types for XML documents as defined by [[XMLSCHEMA1/2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90607) and [[XMLSCHEMA2/2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90609) standards. An XML schema uses XML syntax for its language.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) specifies a device friendly, well-structured messaging model providing basic functionality such as discovery of an endpoint, metadata for that endpoint, and request/response messaging. This model is built using core [**Web Services**](#gt_web-service) specifications as building blocks, and assembled with explanatory text. DPWS identifies the roles of [**clients**](#gt_client), which discover device endpoints and communicate with [**devices**](#gt_device) and [**services**](#gt_service); devices, which can be discoverable service endpoints that host other services, and the services hosted within the device. Additionally, DPWS defines metadata for both devices and the service endpoints hosted by devices.

This model maps to the requirements of modern home computers in most cases. Home computers are often set to be discoverable and provide metadata describing themselves and their endpoints (such as file shares) and resources to clients on a network.

DPWS has one key restriction, in that it recommends clients and services limit their messages to 32,767 octets in length (See [[DPWS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=127841) Appendix I, R0003, and R0026).

Windows leverages the DPWS model for describing home computers and their metadata. In DPWS terminology, a home computer is a device, and services and resources available from the home computer are described by services in metadata.

The metadata provided might be quite large, beyond the size originally envisioned by DPWS for resource constrained devices. This large size is always due to metadata describing resource or [**endpoints**](#gt_endpoint) hosted within the device. This document describes an extension to DPWS that allows a DPWS-based client and service to negotiate a larger acceptable message size.

A client that is capable of accepting large message responses can send a request with the large message support indicator. The service, upon receiving a request, looks for the large message support indicator and:

- If the indicator is present, the service constructs a response which includes all configured metadata and endpoints available from the home computer.
- If the indicator is not present, the service determines what the size of the response will be, and either:
- If the size of the response is less than or equal to the 32,767 octet limit defined in [DPWS], the response is constructed and sent to the client.
- If the size of the response is more than the 32,767 octet limit defined in [DPWS], the response is changed to contain only metadata describing the computer, and is then sent.
The logic in this protocol is structured in this way to help preserve network behavior with clients that do not support the large message support indicator. These clients will still see the existence and basic description of the device, but will not see all of the associated resources and services, as these clients expect services to manage their metadata to within the 32,767 octet limit.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This extension is built on DPWS and relies on DPWS functionality to work. This extension is designed to allow DPWS compliant implementations to negotiate larger message sizes, as supported by standard [**Web Services**](#gt_web-service); that is, normal Web Services not governed by DPWS do not need such a protocol extension.

This extension does not define new [**SOAP messages**](#gt_soap-message) or patterns, but instead defines [**XML Schema**](#gt_xml-schema-xsd) that can be added to existing schema extensibility points.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

Both the [**client**](#gt_client) and the device in this exchange must be DPWS compliant.

The client must accept [**SOAP messages**](#gt_soap-message) larger than 32,767 octets.

Services must be capable of sending as much data as they can prepare.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

Use of this protocol is appropriate for [**client**](#gt_client) implementations if:

- The client is a DPWS compliant implementation.
- The client intends to communicate with the DPWS representation of a computer.
- The client supports receiving DPWS response messages larger than 32,767 octets in length.
Use of this protocol is appropriate for service implementations if:

- The service intends to represent itself as a DPWS compliant computer on the network.
- The service supports sending messages larger than 32,767 in length.
<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This protocol extension covers a single version of the extension as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1). There are no previous versions. There are no special transport requirements or other restrictions placed on DPWS resulting from use of this extension.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

The schema for this protocol extension does define additional vendor extensions.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

There are no specific standards assignments for this protocol extension.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

Use of this protocol extension requires support for the underlying specifications:

- [**Clients**](#gt_client) and [**devices**](#gt_device) implementing this protocol extension MUST be compliant with DPWS as specified in [[DPWS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=127841).
- DPWS-compliant endpoints MUST be fully compatible with the February 2006 revision of DPWS.
DPWS compliance ensures clients and device support the consistent set of protocol versions.

This protocol extension is limited to these existing messages:

- Devices implementing this protocol extension MUST support receiving the extension in the [**SOAP Header**](#gt_soap-header) of a [**SOAP Message**](#gt_soap-message) with the [**SOAP Action**](#gt_soap-action) http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/transfer/Get
- Devices implementing this protocol extension MUST support sending a SOAP Message as a response with a length greater than 32,767 octets.
- Clients implementing this protocol extension MUST support sending the extension in the SOAP Header of a SOAP Message with the SOAP Action http://schemas/xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/transfer/Get
- Clients implementing this protocol extension MUST support receiving a SOAP Message as a response with a length greater than 32,767 octets.
Not all SOAP implementations properly support SOAP Header extensions. This support is required for use of this extension.

This extension does not define a finite boundary for the size of the SOAP Message response.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Common Message Syntax

This section contains common definitions used by this protocol. The syntax of the definitions uses [**XML Schema**](#gt_xml-schema-xsd) as defined in [[XMLSCHEMA1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90608) and [[XMLSCHEMA2]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90610) and [**Web Services Description Language (WSDL)**](#gt_web-services-description-language-wsdl) as defined in [[WSDL]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90577).

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Namespaces

This specification defines and references various [**XML namespaces**](#gt_xml-namespace) using the mechanisms specified in [[XMLNS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=191840). Although this specification associates a specific XML namespace prefix for each XML namespace that is used, the choice of any particular XML namespace prefix is implementation-specific and not significant for interoperability.

| Prefix | Namespace URI | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| s | http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope | [[SOAP1.2-1/2003]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90521) |
| wsa | http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing | [[WSAddressing]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90575) |

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 Messages

This protocol does not define any messages.

<a id="Section_2.2.3"></a>
### 2.2.3 Elements

The following table summarizes the set of common [**XML Schema**](#gt_xml-schema-xsd) element definitions defined by this specification. XML Schema element definitions that are specific to a particular operation are described with the operation.

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| lms:LargeMetadataSupport | Indicator for support of large metadata messages. |

<a id="Section_2.2.3.1"></a>
#### 2.2.3.1 lms:LargeMetadataSupport

The lms:LargeMetadataSupport element is used to indicate client side support for large metadata responses. The normative form for this element is as follows.

<lms:LargeMetadataSupport/>

The element is not extensible and does not support attributes.

The schema for this element is as follows.

<xs:element name='LargeMetadataSupport'>

<xs:complexType>

<xs:sequence />

</xs:complexType>

</xs:element>

This element MUST NOT be used outside of the top level of the [**SOAP header**](#gt_soap-header) in a [**SOAP Message**](#gt_soap-message). If the element is used outside of the top level of the SOAP header where it is defined as semantically meaningful, then it will be ignored. Standard exceptions to this apply (for example, if the header is inserted in a location that violates the schema).This element MUST NOT be used in SOAP headers where the wsa:Action is not http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/transfer/Get. If the element is used in a SOAP header when the action is not http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/transfer/Get and the service understands the action, then the element will be ignored.

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

Clients indicating they support large metadata response can use this in a DDoS attack on [**services**](#gt_service) . The nature of the attack is to have a large number of distributed clients issue requests indicating they support large responses. Assuming TCP is in use, the clients would then slow their processing of data and cause TCP backoffs to slow data transmission to 100 bytes/second. The large number of clients would result in a significant number of active connections and potentially a large amount of in memory state on the service. It is not clear that this attack is significantly more damaging than having the clients aggressively download, which would instead exhaust bandwidth but would have similar external consequences.

Similarly, clients indicating they support large metadata responses can end up receiving a large response at a very slow rate, and might be impacted by the same in-memory state concerns as services.
