# 1 Introduction

The Windows Deployment Services (WDS) OS Deployment Protocol specifies services exposed by the WDS server which are used by the clients to deploy an operating system (OS) on a machine. It is a client/server protocol which uses the Windows Deployment Services Control Protocol to communicate.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses LDAP as its primary access protocol. [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) stores information about a variety of objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md). [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is either deployed as [**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**](#gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), which are both described in [MS-ADOD](../MS-ADOD/MS-ADOD.md): Active Directory Protocols Overview.

<a id="gt_active-directory-domain"></a>
**Active Directory domain**: A [**domain**](#gt_domain) hosted on [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory). For more information, see [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

<a id="gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds"></a>
**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**: A directory service (DS) implemented by a domain controller (DC). The DS provides a data store for objects that is distributed across multiple DCs. The DCs interoperate as peers to ensure that a local change to an object replicates correctly across DCs. AD DS is a deployment of [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) [MS-ADTS].

<a id="gt_client-machine-guid"></a>
**client machine GUID**: Each client machine is assigned a unique GUID by the machine manufacturer and is stored in the SMBIOS of the client machine as per [[DMTF-DSP0134]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=144120).

<a id="gt_deployed-os"></a>
**deployed OS**: An operating system (OS) image that has been deployed/installed on the client machine.

<a id="gt_deployment-agent"></a>
**deployment agent**: An application on the client machine that communicates with WDS server and deploys an OS image on the client machine.

<a id="gt_deployment-agent-unattend"></a>
**deployment agent unattend**: Unattended instructions that provide input for all or some steps performed by the deployment agent. If unattended instructions do not provide input for certain steps, the deployment agent asks the user for input.

<a id="gt_domain"></a>
**domain**: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a domain controller (DC) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) service. The domain controller provides authentication of members, creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD](../MS-AUTHSOD/MS-AUTHSOD.md) section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS].

<a id="gt_domain-join"></a>
**domain join**: A process to configure a machine to join an Active Directory domain and assume the identity assigned to it by the domain controller.

<a id="gt_driver"></a>
**driver**: Software that allows applications to interact with a hardware device by using abstract/high-level constructs.

<a id="gt_driver-package"></a>
**driver package**: A collection of the files needed to successfully load a driver. This includes the device information (.inf) file, the catalog file, and all of the binaries that are copied by the .inf file. Multiple drivers packaged together for deployment purposes.

<a id="gt_endpoint-guid"></a>
**Endpoint GUID**: Set of relevant services provided by a Service Provider are grouped together and as a whole identified by a unique Endpoint GUID.

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) must be used for generating the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_image-group"></a>
**image group**: Each image group has a unique name and an ACL to specify users who are allowed to deploy OS images from the image group. An image group can contain multiple OS image containers.

<a id="gt_little-endian"></a>
**little-endian**: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the least significant byte stored in the memory location with the lowest address.

<a id="gt_machine-naming-policy"></a>
**machine naming policy**: Specifies a naming scheme that is used to generate a name for the machine.

<a id="gt_multicast-namespace"></a>
**multicast namespace**: Hosts multiple content that are available to clients using multicast sessions. Identification by a unique name is required. All content under a multicast namespace is available for transmission over multicast transmission.

<a id="gt_multicast-transmission"></a>
**multicast transmission**: The ability of server to send OS image container files using the multicast feature of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

<a id="gt_os-deployment-process"></a>
**OS deployment process**: Set of operations that must be performed by the deployment agent to prepare and deploy an OS image on client machine. It also includes steps that are performed by a deployed OS to bring the OS to a functioning state. Each step in the process might require input from the user.

<a id="gt_os-image"></a>
**OS image**: Set of files required to deploy/install an Operating System on a machine. Each OS image is in either Virtual Hard Drive (VHD) or Windows Imaging (WIM) format. Each OS image also has associated OS image metadata.

<a id="gt_os-image-container"></a>
**OS Image Container**: Single or multiple files that contain one or more OS images. Each OS image is identified by a unique numeric value in an OS image container.

<a id="gt_os-image-language"></a>
**OS Image Language**: An OS image supports multiple locales and at deployment time any supported locale can be chosen for deployment.

<a id="gt_os-image-metadata"></a>
**OS Image Metadata**: Set of attributes that specifies the properties of an OS image.

<a id="gt_os-image-unattend"></a>
**OS Image Unattend**: Unattended instructions that provide input for some or all steps performed by the Deployed OS to bring OS to a functioning state. If Unattended instructions do not provide input for certain steps, Deployed OS asks user for input.

<a id="gt_remote-installation-reminst-share"></a>
**Remote Installation (REMINST) Share**: A disk share that all WDS servers are required to create on initialization.

<a id="gt_status-message"></a>
**Status Message**: Client sends status update messages to WDS server during deployment of an OS image on client machine. Each status message includes the severity and description.

<a id="gt_unattend-variable"></a>
**Unattend Variable**: A placeholder in the Unattended Instructions that is replaced by a value during OS Deployment Process.

<a id="gt_unattended-instructions"></a>
**Unattended Instructions**: Set of instructions that enable Deployment Agent and Deployed OS to operate in Unattended Mode.

<a id="gt_unattended-mode"></a>
**Unattended Mode**: Same as Unattended Operation.

<a id="gt_unicode-string"></a>
**Unicode string**: A Unicode 8-bit string is an ordered sequence of 8-bit units, a Unicode 16-bit string is an ordered sequence of 16-bit code units, and a Unicode 32-bit string is an ordered sequence of 32-bit code units. In some cases, it could be acceptable not to terminate with a terminating null character. Unless otherwise specified, all [**Unicode strings**](#gt_unicode-string) follow the UTF-16LE encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).

<a id="gt_vhd-image"></a>
**VHD Image**: An OS image packaged in the Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) format.

<a id="gt_wds-server"></a>
**WDS server**: A Windows Deployment Services (WDS) server that communicates with clients by using the WDS OS Deployment Protocol to aid in deployment of an OS image on a client machine. Clients also communicate to a WDS server to request initiation/setup of multicast sessions for content available in multicast namespace on server.A WDS server provides an extensible mechanism to allow service providers to provide services to clients.

<a id="gt_wim-image"></a>
**WIM Image**: An OS image packaged in Windows Imaging (WIM) file format.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The [**deployment agent**](#gt_deployment-agent) uses the WDS OS Deployment Protocol (WDSOSD) to request information concerning deployment of an [**OS image**](#gt_os-image) on the client system. This information includes instructions for deploying an OS with or without user interaction, available OS images on the server, reporting of current status of the client, and joining of an [**Active Directory domain**](#gt_active-directory-domain) at the end of the deployment process.

A typical interaction between client and server involves the following steps (for brevity, only the core steps for OS deployment are included below).

- The client has already obtained the name or IP address of the [**WDS server**](#gt_wds-server).
- The deployment agent queries the WDS server if it should perform the [**OS deployment process**](#gt_os-deployment-process) in [**unattended mode**](#gt_unattended-mode), along with [**unattended instructions**](#gt_unattended-instructions) for the deployment agent, if applicable.
- The client obtains user credentials and requests the server to enumerate the OS images available to the client.
- Once an OS image is selected, the client proceeds to download the relevant files, and deploys the OS image on the client machine.
- The client queries the server as to whether the client machine is to join an Active Directory domain, and applies the policy depending on the answer.
- The client enumerates all devices installed on the client machine and requests applicable [**driver packages**](#gt_driver-package) from the server, and then proceeds to configure the [**deployed OS**](#gt_deployed-os) using the driver package returned by the server.
<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The WDS OS Deployment Protocol relies on the Windows Deployment Services Control Protocol as transport. It uses the WDS Control Protocol to send and receive replies.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship of the WDS OS Deployment Protocol and how it relates to the WDS Control Protocol.

![Protocol relationships (WDS OS Deployment Protocol to WDS Control Protocol)](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Protocol relationships (WDS OS Deployment Protocol to WDS Control Protocol)

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

This protocol is implemented on top of the WDS Control Protocol, and therefore has the prerequisites identified in [MS-WDSC](../MS-WDSC/MS-WDSC.md).

The WDS OS Deployment Protocol assumes that the client has obtained the name or IP address of the server that supports this protocol.

The [**deployment agent**](#gt_deployment-agent) supports the [**OS images**](#gt_os-image) available on the server and is responsible for deploying and installing the OS image from an [**OS image container**](#gt_os-image-container) to the client machine.

The deployment agent and [**WDS server**](#gt_wds-server) have an agreement on the format of the [**deployment agent unattend**](#gt_deployment-agent-unattend), if applicable.

The WDS server and [**deployed OS**](#gt_deployed-os) have an agreement on the format of the deployed OS unattend.

The deployment agent can process replacement variables for the deployed OS unattend.

The deployment agent is capable of configuring the deployed OS to join a specific [**Active Directory domain**](#gt_active-directory-domain), if applicable.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is applicable when an application deploys an OS on a client machine.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

- Supported transports: This protocol uses the Windows Deployment Services Control Protocol for transport as specified in section [2](#Section_2).
- Protocol versions: The protocol supports multiple [**Endpoint GUIDs**](#gt_endpoint-guid) and opcodes as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).
- Security and authentication methods: The security requirements for each Endpoint GUID and opcode are defined in [2.2](#Section_1.3).
- Localization: The protocol acts as a pass-through for all strings; no support for localization is built into the protocol.
- Capability negotiation: The protocol does explicit capability negotiation for certain Endpoint GUIDs and opcodes as specified in the following section.
| Capability | Section |
| --- | --- |
| WDS_OP_IMG_ENUMERATE | Section [2.2.6](#Section_2.2.6) |

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol uses Win32 error codes as defined in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.2. Vendors SHOULD reuse those values with their indicated meaning. Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the future.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>

# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Server Details

This section specifies the WDS OS Deployment Protocol behavior for [**WDS server**](#gt_wds-server).

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

**image group:** Collection of [**OS images**](#gt_os-image) grouped under an image group. Each [**image group**](#gt_image-group) is identified by a unique name, and access to OS images in the image group is controlled by image group access control list.

**image group access control list:** An access control list that specifies which client identities have read permissions for the image group.

**image store:** Collection of image groups. All files and folders for image groups and OS images in an image group are made available by the server using a network share<35>

**WDS server configuration:** Configuration information for a server, in persistent storage, in the form of (name, value) pairs. The list of metadata information can be found in section [3.1.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1).

**driver package store:** Persistent storage where files and metadata for each [**driver package**](#gt_driver-package) is stored. All files for driver packages are made available by the server using a network share<36>

**status messages log:** A persistent storage where all [**status message**](#gt_status-message)s received from clients are stored.

**deployment agent unattend store:** A persistent storage where [**unattended instructions**](#gt_unattended-instructions) for the [**deployment agent**](#gt_deployment-agent) for each processor architecture are stored.

**computers in active directory domain:** Configuration information for each client machine is stored in the [**Active Directory domain**](#gt_active-directory-domain).

**users in active directory domain:** Configuration information for each user is stored in the Active Directory domain.

**computers in a custom computer data store:** Configuration information for each client machine can be stored in a custom data store remotely on the server machine, or locally on the server machine, in a format other than the Active Directory domain.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.1"></a>
#### 3.1.1.1 WDS Server Configuration

The following properties are stored for the [**WDS server**](#gt_wds-server) configuration.

**ClientLoggingLevel:** A numeric value that specifies the types of [**status message**](#gt_status-message)s the client MUST log during the [**OS deployment process**](#gt_os-deployment-process).

**OrganizationName:** Specifies the business name of the organization.

TimeZone: Specifies the time zone configured on the server.

**NewMachinesJoinDomain:** A Boolean value that, when set to True, specifies that all client machines that do not have a computer object in the [**Active Directory domain**](#gt_active-directory-domain) MUST join the Active Directory domain. A value of False specifies that such client machines MUST NOT join an Active Directory domain.

**NewMachineNamingPolicy:** Specifies the naming scheme to use to generate the name for the client machines ([Machine Naming Policy](#Section_3.1.1.4) section).

**NewMachineOU:** Specifies the distinguished name of the organizational unit (OU) in the Active Directory domain where client machines that do not have a computer object in the Active Directory domain MUST create the computer object.

**PrestageUsingMAC:** A Boolean value that, when set to True, specifies that all client machines that do not have a computer object in Active Directory domain MUST set the netbootGUID attribute of the computer object to the MAC address of the network interface card being used by the client to communicate with the server. When set to False, this value specifies that the [**client machine GUID**](#gt_client-machine-guid) MUST be used for the netbootGUID attribute of the computer object.

**ResetBootProgram:** A Boolean value that, when set to True, specifies that the client MUST delete the value of the netbootMachineFilePath attribute of the computer object. When set to False, the client MUST NOT take any action.

**ImageFilterOnVersion:** A Boolean value that, when set to True, specifies that the client MUST display [**OS images**](#gt_os-image) where the version of the OS image exactly matches the version of the OS being used by the client for deployment. When set to False, the client MUST NOT do any filtering based on versions.

**ImageFilterOnFirmware:** A Boolean value that, when set to True, specifies that the client MUST display OS images where the firmware type of the OS image exactly matches the firmware type of the client machine. When set to False, the client MUST NOT filter OS images based on firmware type.

**OSImageUnattendOverride:** A Boolean value that, when set to True, specifies that the [**unattended instructions**](#gt_unattended-instructions) for the [**deployed OS**](#gt_deployed-os) present on the client machine MUST override any unattended instructions for the deployed OS provided by the server. When set to False, the unattended instructions provided by the server MUST be used.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.2"></a>
#### 3.1.1.2 Computers in Active Directory Domain

The server uses the MAC address or the [**client machine GUID**](#gt_client-machine-guid) to find the computer object in [**Active Directory Domain**](#gt_active-directory-domain) for each client. The server uses the LDAP search filter as follows to search for the computer object for the client machine.

(&(objectClass=Computer)(|(netbootGUID=<MAC Address>)(netbootGUID=<client machine GUID>)))

If more than one matching computer object is found, the server uses the first matching computer object.

MachineName: Any dollar sign characters at the end of the value for **samAccountName** attribute are removed, and the resulting value is used as machine name for the client machine.

**netbootMirrorDataFile**: This attribute is used to store multiple values in the following format:

<key-1>=<value-1>; <key-2>=<value-2>;...; <key-N>=<value-N>;

DeploymentAgentUnattend: Specifies the relative path to the file containing [**unattended instructions**](#gt_unattended-instructions) for [**deployment agent**](#gt_deployment-agent). The value is stored in **netbootMirrorDataFile** attribute using the **WdsUnattendFilePath** key. If the key is missing from **netbootMirrorDataFile**, or the value is set to an empty string, then it MUST be treated as if there is no unattended instruction for the deployment agent.

JoinDomain: Specifies whether the client machine MUST join an Active Directory domain. The value is stored in the **netbootMirrorDataFile** attribute using the **DomainJoin** key. The value is a numeric value which is set to zero to indicate that the client machine MUST NOT join the Active Directory domain; a nonzero value indicates that the client machine MUST join the Active Directory domain. If this key is missing from the **netbootMirrorDataFile** attribute, it MUST be treated as being set to a nonzero value.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.3"></a>
#### 3.1.1.3 Users in the Active Directory Domain

The server uses the user name of the authenticated user to find the user object in [**Active Directory domain**](#gt_active-directory-domain). The server uses the following LDAP search filter to find the user account.

(&(objectClass=User)(samAccountName=<User Name>$))

FirstName: The **givenName** attribute specifies the first name of the user.

LastName: The **sn** attribute specifies the last name of the user.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.4"></a>
#### 3.1.1.4 Machine Naming Policy

The [**machine naming policy**](#gt_machine-naming-policy) is used to generate a unique name for the client machine so that it can join an [**Active Directory domain**](#gt_active-directory-domain). A machine naming policy consists of alphanumeric characters, and has variables embedded in it. The variables are replaced with actual values to generate a unique name for the client machine.

The following variables MUST be supported.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| %[0][length]First | Replaced with the first name of the user. |
| %[0][length]Last | Replaced with the last name of the user. |
| %[0][length]Username | Replaced with the user name of the user. |
| %[0][length]MAC | Replaced with the MAC address of the network interface card being used by the client machine to communicate with the [**WDS server**](#gt_wds-server). |
| %[0][length]# | Replaced with an incremental number. |

Variable names MUST be treated as case-insensitive.

The fields inside square brackets [] are optional.

If a percentage (%) character is followed by zero, then a numeric value for length MUST be specified.

The length field specifies the maximum number of characters to be used for the variable value, counting the characters from left to right. If the length of the value for a variable is larger than the length specified by the length field, it MUST be trimmed to the length specified by length. If the length of the value for a variable is smaller than length, then the actual value for the variable is used.

If the percentage (%) character is followed by zero, and the length of the value for a variable is smaller than the length, then the value MUST be left-padded with zeros to increase the length of value to length.

If neither zero nor length is specified following the percentage (%) character, then the actual value for the variable is used.

The server MUST validate that the client has specified all required variables.

The server MUST validate that all deployment agent metadata strings match the format specified in section [2.2.9](#Section_3.1.5.8).

The server MUST add all required variables to the reply packet.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.9"></a>
#### 3.1.5.9 WDS_OP_RESET_BOOT_PROGRAM

The WDS_OP_RESET_BOOT_PROGRAM opcode is used by the client to notify the server that the deployment is complete, and the server SHOULD therefore reset the PXE boot program selected for the client, if appropriate per server policy, so that the client will not attempt to boot from the network after the client next reboots.

The server MUST validate that the client has specified all required variables.

The server MUST use the **CLIENT_MAC** and **CLIENT_GUID** variables to locate the Computer Object in the custom computer data store.

The server MUST delete the attribute in the custom computer data store that corresponds to the boot program, similar to netbootMachineFilePath in Active Directory.

## 3.2 Client Details

This section specifies the WDS OS Deployment Protocol behavior for clients.

<a id="Section_3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

**OSImageUnattend**: [**unattended instructions**](#gt_unattended-instructions) for [**deployed OS**](#gt_deployed-os) that MAY be present on the client machine.

**Client Configuration**: A temporary storage mechanism where the client stores the configuration information.

**Client Metadata**: Temporary storage which records the deployment agent metadata in the server's response to the WDSDCMGR_OP_QUERY_METADATA opcode. This is a list of strings in the format specified by the ABNF grammar given in section [2.2.9](#Section_3.1.5.8). The list is initially empty.

<a id="Section_3.2.1.1"></a>
#### 3.2.1.1 Client Configuration

The following properties are stored for the [**WDS server**](#gt_wds-server) configuration.

**LogTransactionId**: A unique Transaction ID that is returned by the *WDS_OP_LOG_INIT* opcode (section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1)).

**LogLevel**: Specifies the severity level for the [**status message**](#gt_status-message)s that MUST be sent to the server (section 2.2.1).

**UnattendFlags**: Specifies a set of flags that are returned by *WDS_OP_GET_CLIENT_UNATTEND* (section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3)).

**DeploymentAgentUnattend**: [**Unattended Instructions**](#gt_unattended-instructions) returned by *WDS_OP_GET_CLIENT_UNATTEND* (section 2.2.3).

**SelectedOSImage**: An [**OS image**](#gt_os-image) that is selected for deployment on the client machine.

<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

<a id="Section_3.2.3.1"></a>
#### 3.2.3.1 Initialize Logging

The client MUST initialize logging using the opcode specified in [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1).

The value of the TRANSACTION_ID variable in the reply packet MUST be stored in LogTransactionID (section [3.2.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1)).

The value of the LOGLEVEL variable in the reply packet MUST be stored in LogLevel (section 3.2.1.1).

<a id="Section_3.2.3.2"></a>
#### 3.2.3.2 Initialize Deployment Agent Metadata

The client MAY<44> initialize deployment agent metadata using the WDSDCMGR_OP_QUERY_METADATA opcode, if the server has made the deployment agent metadata [**Endpoint GUID**](#gt_endpoint-guid) available.

The list of entries specified by the **Metadata.Entry[index]** variables in the servers reply is stored in Client Metadata.

The deployment agent can use the deployment agent metadata in Client Metadata to customize or extend the functionality of the deployment agent.

<a id="Section_3.2.3.3"></a>
#### 3.2.3.3 Status Message: Client Started

The client MUST send WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_STARTED using [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2), if allowed by LogLevel (section [3.2.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1)).

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.5"></a>
### 3.2.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1"></a>
#### 3.2.5.1 Getting Unattended Instructions for Deployment Agent

The client MUST query the server for [**unattended instructions**](#gt_unattended-instructions) for the [**deployment agent**](#gt_deployment-agent) using the *WDS_OP_GET_CLIENT_UNATTEND* opcode (section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3)).

The client MUST set **UnattendFlags** (section [3.2.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1)) to the value of the **FLAGS** variable in the reply packet.

If **UnattendFlags** specifies the WdsCliClientUnattendPresent flag, the client MUST set DeploymentAgentUnattend (section 3.2.1.1) to the value of the **CLIENT_UNATTEND** variable.

The client MUST log the [**status message**](#gt_status-message) as follows if allowed by **LogLevel** (section 3.2.1.1):

- If the client has been provided unattended instructions, it MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_UNATTEND_MODE status message.
- The client MAY log the same status message when no unattended instructions are provided.<45>
<a id="Section_3.2.5.2"></a>
#### 3.2.5.2 Getting Credentials

The client MUST get user credentials that are to be used for authentication to the server. If the DeploymentAgentUnattend (section [3.2.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1)) specifies user credentials, then the [**deployment agent**](#gt_deployment-agent) MUST NOT prompt the user for credentials.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.3"></a>
#### 3.2.5.3 Getting List of Images

The client MUST query for a list of [**OS images**](#gt_os-image) that are available to the client using WDS_OP_IMG_ENUMERATE (section [2.2.6](#Section_2.2.6)).

If DeploymentAgentUnattend (section [3.2.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1)) specifies an OS image that is to be deployed, the [**deployment agent**](#gt_deployment-agent) MUST automatically select the specified OS image. No user input MUST be required.

If DeploymentAgentUnattend (section 3.2.1.1) does not specify an OS image for deployment, the deployment agent MUST present all available OS images to the user and wait for the user to make a selection.

The SelectedOSImage (section 3.2.1.1) MUST be set to the OS images selected for deployment (either automatically or by user input).

If LogLevel allows logging, the client MUST log the WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_IMAGE_SELECTED3 status message. If an attempt to log WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_IMAGE_SELECTED3 fails, the client MUST try again using the WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_IMAGE_SELECTED2 status message. If an attempt to log fails, the client MUST try again using the WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_IMAGE_SELECTED status message.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.4"></a>

The client MUST try to download the SelectedOSImage (section 3.2.1.1) files using [**Multicast Transmission**](#gt_multicast-transmission).

If [**OS image container**](#gt_os-image-container) files are not available via Multicast Transmission, the client MUST fall back to using an alternate mechanism<46> and MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_TRANSFER_DOWNGRADE status message if allowed by LogLevel (section 3.2.1.1).

If LogLevel (section 3.2.1.1) allows logging, the client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_TRANSFER_END status message when the download has completed.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.5"></a>
#### 3.2.5.5 Applying Selected OS Image

If **LogLevel** (section [3.2.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1)) allows logging, the client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_APPLY_STARTED_2 [**status message**](#gt_status-message). If the attempt to log the message fails, the client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_APPLY_STARTED status message.

The client MUST process the [**OS image container**](#gt_os-image-container) files for SelectedOSImage (section 3.2.1.1) and deploy them to the client machine.

When the OS has been deployed, and if **LogLevel** (section 3.2.1.1) allows logging, the client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_APPLY_FINISHED_2 status message. If the attempt to log the message fails, the client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_APPLY_FINISHED status message.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.6"></a>
#### 3.2.5.6 Driver Injection

If **LogLevel** (section [3.2.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1)) allows logging, the client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_OFFLINE_DRIVER_INJECTION_START [**status message**](#gt_status-message).

The client MUST query and send a list of all devices installed on the client machine to the server using WDS_OP_GET_MACHINE_DRIVER_PACKAGES (section [2.2.7](#Section_2.2.7)).

For each [**driver package**](#gt_driver-package) that is returned by the server, the client MUST configure the [**deployed OS**](#gt_deployed-os) to use the driver package.

The client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_DRIVER_PACKAGE_NOT_ACCESSIBLE status message if the files for the driver package are not accessible, and if LogLevel (section 3.2.1.1) allows it.

The client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_OFFLINE_DRIVER_INJECTION_FAILURE status message if it encounters a failure configuring the deployed OS for the driver package, and LogLevel (section 3.2.1.1) allows it.

If **LogLevel** (section 3.2.1.1) allows logging, the client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_OFFLINE_DRIVER_INJECTION_END status message.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.7"></a>
#### 3.2.5.7 Deployed OS Unattend and Domain Join

If **LogLevel** (section [3.2.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1)) allows logging, the client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_POST_ACTIONS_START [**status message**](#gt_status-message).

The client MUST get [**domain join**](#gt_domain-join) information from the server using WDS_OP_GET_DOMAIN_JOIN_INFORMATION (section [2.2.5](#Section_2.2.5)).

If the FLAGS variable in the reply packet includes the WdsCliJoinDomain flag, and if WdsCliFlagsAccountExists is also specified, the client MUST follow the steps in section [3.1.5.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.5.1) ; otherwise the client MUST follow steps in section [3.1.5.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.5.2).

If the client fails to configure the [**deployed OS**](#gt_deployed-os) to join an [**Active Directory domain**](#gt_active-directory-domain), and if allowed by **LogLevel**), the client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_DOMAINJOINERROR2 status message. If the attempt to log the status message fails, the client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_DOMAINJOINERROR status message.

The client MUST query the server for [**unattended instructions**](#gt_unattended-instructions) for the deployed OS. The WDS OS Deployment Protocol does not provide a mechanism for obtaining the unattended instructions for the deployed OS. A contract MUST exist between client and server on how this information is communicated.

If unattended instructions for the deployed OS exists, the client MUST query for [**unattend variables**](#gt_unattend-variable) for unattended instructions for the deployed OS, using WDS_OP_GET_UNATTEND_VARIABLES (section [2.2.4](#Section_2.2.4)), and MUST perform variable replacement for unattended instructions for the deployed OS. The client MUST also configure the deployed OS to use the unattended instructions.

If **LogLevel** allows logging, the client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_POST_ACTIONS_ENDstatus message.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.7.1"></a>
##### 3.2.5.7.1 Computer Account Exists

If the **FLAGS** variable specifies WdsCliFlagResetBootProgram, the **MACHINEDN** variable is specified, and the value of the **MACHINEDN** variable is not the empty string, the client MUST delete the value of the **netbootMachineFilePath** attribute in the computer object specified by **MACHINEDN**.

If the **FLAGS** variable specifies WdsCliFlagResetBootProgram, and the **MACHINEDN** variable is not specified or the value of the **MACHINEDN** variable is the empty string, the client MUST reset the boot program by using WDS_OP_RESET_BOOT_PROGRAM.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.7.2"></a>
##### 3.2.5.7.2 Computer Account Does Not Exist

The client MUST generate a unique name for the client machine using the [**machine naming policy**](#gt_machine-naming-policy) (section [3.1.1.4](#Section_3.1.1.4)) specified using the **MACHINENAME** variable, and MUST create a computer object in [**Active Directory domain**](#gt_active-directory-domain) in Organizational Unit specified by **MACHINEOU** variable.

If **FLAGS** variable specifies WdsCliFlagsPrestageUsingMAC, the client MUST set the netbootGUID attribute of the computer object to the MAC address of the network interface card being used to communicate with server; otherwise this attribute MUST be set to the [**client machine GUID**](#gt_client-machine-guid).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.8"></a>
#### 3.2.5.8 Finishing Up

If **LogLevel** (section [3.2.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1)) allows logging, the client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_FINISHED [**status message**](#gt_status-message).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.9"></a>
#### 3.2.5.9 Error Handling

When the client encounters a fatal error and is unable to continue, it MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_ERROR [**status message**](#gt_status-message), if allowed by **LogLevel** (section [3.2.1.1](#Section_3.2.1.1)).
