# 1 Introduction

The One-Time Password Certificate Enrollment Protocol was created to enhance the network security of remote access connections. The protocol uses different components to increase network security. For example, the [**one-time password (OTP)**](#gt_one-time-password-otp) authentication mechanism provides enhanced security for remote clients connecting to a server by using different passwords for each logon session. Another component used by the protocol is a short-lived [**smart card**](#gt_smart-card) logon [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template).

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses LDAP as its primary access protocol. [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) stores information about a variety of objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by [**Kerberos**](#gt_kerberos) [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md). [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is either deployed as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), which are both described in [MS-ADOD](../MS-ADOD/MS-ADOD.md): Active Directory Protocols Overview.

<a id="gt_certificate-template"></a>
**certificate template**: A list of attributes that define a blueprint for creating an X.509 certificate. It is often referred to in non-Microsoft documentation as a "certificate profile". A [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template) is used to define the content and purpose of a digital certificate, including issuance requirements (certificate policies), implemented X.509 extensions such as application policies, key usage, or extended key usage as specified in [[X509]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90590), and enrollment permissions. Enrollment permissions define the rules by which a [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) will issue or deny certificate requests. In Windows environments, [**certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template) are stored as objects in the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) and used by Microsoft enterprise [**CAs**](#gt_certification-authority-ca).

<a id="gt_certification-authority-ca"></a>
**certification authority (CA)**: A third party that issues public key certificates. Certificates serve to bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide whether to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust is to be transitive. For more information, see [[RFC3280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90414).

<a id="gt_directaccess"></a>
**DirectAccess**: A collection of different component policies, including Name Resolution Policy and IPsec, which allows seamless connectivity to corporate resources when not physically connected to the corporate network.

<a id="gt_enhanced-key-usage-eku"></a>
**enhanced key usage (EKU)**: An extension that is a collection of object identifiers (OIDs) that indicate the applications that use the key.

<a id="gt_group-policy"></a>
**Group Policy**: A mechanism that allows the implementer to specify managed configurations for users and computers in an [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) service environment.

<a id="gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http"></a>
**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: An application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the World Wide Web.

<a id="gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-secure-https"></a>
**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**: An extension of HTTP that securely encrypts and decrypts web page requests. In some older protocols, "Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Sockets Layer" is still used (Secure Sockets Layer has been deprecated). For more information, see [[SSL3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90534) and [[RFC5246]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129803).

<a id="gt_kerberos"></a>
**Kerberos**: An authentication system that enables two parties to exchange private information across an otherwise open network by assigning a unique key (called a ticket) to each user that logs on to the network and then embedding these tickets into messages sent by the users. For more information, see [MS-KILE].

<a id="gt_key-distribution-center-kdc"></a>
**Key Distribution Center (KDC)**: The [**Kerberos**](#gt_kerberos) service that implements the authentication and ticket granting services specified in the [**Kerberos**](#gt_kerberos) protocol. The service runs on computers selected by the administrator of the realm or domain; it is not present on every machine on the network. It has to have access to an account database for the realm that it serves. [**KDCs**](#gt_key-distribution-center-kdc) are integrated into the domain controller role. It is a network service that supplies tickets to clients for use in authenticating to services.

<a id="gt_key-storage-provider-ksp"></a>
**key storage provider (KSP)**: A Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG) component which can be used to create, delete, export, import, open and store keys.

<a id="gt_one-time-password-otp"></a>
**one-time password (OTP)**: A password that is valid for only one logon session or transaction in the One-Time Password Certificate Enrollment Protocol.

<a id="gt_public-key-cryptography-standards-pkcs"></a>
**Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)**: A group of Public Key Cryptography Standards published by RSA Laboratories.

<a id="gt_public-key-infrastructure-pki"></a>
**public key infrastructure (PKI)**: The laws, policies, standards, and software that regulate or manipulate certificates and public and private keys. In practice, it is a system of digital certificates, [**certificate authorities (CAs)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca), and other registration authorities that verify and authenticate the validity of each party involved in an electronic transaction. For more information, see [X509] section 6.

<a id="gt_remote-authentication-dial-in-user-service-radius"></a>
**Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)**: A protocol for carrying authentication, authorization, and configuration information between a network access server (NAS) that prefers to authenticate connection requests from endpoints and a shared server that performs authentication, authorization, and accounting.

<a id="gt_secure-sockets-layer-ssl"></a>
**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**: A security protocol that supports confidentiality and integrity of messages in client and server applications that communicate over open networks. SSL supports server and, optionally, client authentication using X.509 certificates [X509] and [[RFC5280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131034). SSL is superseded by Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS version 1.0 is based on SSL version 3.0 [SSL3].

<a id="gt_smart-card"></a>
**smart card**: A portable device that is shaped like a business card and is embedded with a memory chip and either a microprocessor or some non-programmable logic. [**Smart cards**](#gt_smart-card) are often used as authentication tokens and for secure key storage. [**Smart cards**](#gt_smart-card) used for secure key storage have the ability to perform cryptographic operations with the stored key without allowing the key itself to be read or otherwise extracted from the card.

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world. The [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) standard [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16 BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

<a id="gt_xml"></a>
**XML**: The Extensible Markup Language, as described in [[XML1.0]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90599).

<a id="gt_xml-namespace"></a>
**XML namespace**: A collection of names that is used to identify elements, types, and attributes in XML documents identified in a URI reference [[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453). A combination of XML namespace and local name allows XML documents to use elements, types, and attributes that have the same names but come from different sources. For more information, see [[XMLNS-2ED]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90602).

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

The One-Time Password Certificate Enrollment Protocol is a stateless application-layer protocol. This protocol defines one type of request message, sent from the client to the server, and one type of response message, returned by the server to the client. The request message consists of the user name, [**one-time password (OTP)**](#gt_one-time-password-otp), and certificate enrollment request. The response message consists of the return code, an optional signed certificate enrollment request (the same request that was sent by the client to the server), and (also optional) the name of the [**certification authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) from which to enroll the certificate.

This protocol was created for OTP authentication with [**DirectAccess**](#gt_directaccess) as described in [[MSFT-OTP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=229474). It is used as part of the mechanism that transforms OTP credentials into a short-lived [**smart card**](#gt_smart-card) logon certificate that is used for [**Kerberos**](#gt_kerberos) smart card authentication. The certificate is short-lived to minimize the risk of it being reused for future authentication sessions. It is configured to the minimum lifetime supported by the [**public key infrastructure (PKI)**](#gt_public-key-infrastructure-pki) in use. The following figure shows how the protocol is used in DirectAccess authentication.

![DirectAccess OTP authentication process](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: DirectAccess OTP authentication process

In the DirectAccess implementation of the One-Time Password Certificate Enrollment Protocol, the following events take place.

- The DirectAccess client sends OTP credentials along with a short-lived smart card logon certificate enrollment request to the DirectAccess server over a [**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**](#gt_secure-sockets-layer-ssl) tunnel, where both client and server are mutually authenticated by certificates.
- The DirectAccess server communicates with an OTP authentication server using the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) [[RFC1334]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=148311) over [**Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)**](#gt_remote-authentication-dial-in-user-service-radius) in order to validate the OTP credentials.
- The DirectAccess server signs the certificate enrollment request with a dedicated signing certificate only the DirectAccess server possesses. After that, the signed certificate request and the name of the CA (from which the DirectAccess client enrolls the short-lived smart card logon certificate) are sent to the DirectAccess client by using the OTPCE protocol.
- The DirectAccess client communicates with the certification authority (CA) using a [**Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)**](#gt_public-key-cryptography-standards-pkcs) #10 request [[RFC2986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90401) and a PKCS #7 response [[RFC2315]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90334) in order to enroll a short-lived smart card logon certificate. The enrolled short-lived certificate is used by the PKINIT Protocol ([MS-PKCA](../MS-PKCA/MS-PKCA.md)) to acquire a new Kerberos ticket from the [**Key Distribution Center (KDC)**](#gt_key-distribution-center-kdc) for the user.
The following figure shows a protocol message exchange of successful OTP credential validation by the OTP server and the subsequent signing of the certificate enrollment request by the server.

![Successful sequence for certificate enrollment](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: Successful sequence for certificate enrollment

The following figure shows a typical protocol message exchange in which invalid OTP credentials are rejected by the OTP server. In this case, the server returns an error and does not proceed with the signing of the certificate enrollment request.

## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The One-Time Password Certificate Enrollment Protocol is a [**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http)-based protocol. Every protocol request is a single pair of HTTP POST and HTTP response messages. Failure to carry out the request due to server error is reported by an HTTP response code.

The parameters of the protocol's requests and responses are carried in [**XML**](#gt_xml)-formatted body of the message. The full XML schema (XSD) is described in section [6](#Section_6).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

For One-Time Password Certificate Enrollment Protocol communication to begin, the prerequisite configuration is as follows:

- The administrator sets up an [**OTP**](#gt_one-time-password-otp) authentication solution from an OTP vendor that includes an OTP authentication server and hardware/software OTP tokens for end users.
- The administrator establishes one or more implementation-specific<1> [**CA**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) servers, configures a new, unique application-policy [**enhanced key usage (EKU)**](#gt_enhanced-key-usage-eku) in [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory), and configures two [**certificate templates**](#gt_certificate-template) on it:
- A short-lived [**smart card**](#gt_smart-card) logon certificate template.
- A signing certificate template with the new, unique application-policy EKU.
The CA server requires permissions to enroll certificates by using this certificate template. The administrator grants users read and enroll permissions to the short-lived smart card logon certificate template. The administrator grants the OTPCEP server enroll and auto enroll permissions to the signing certificate template.

In addition, configure the CA to verify that any short-lived smart card logon certificate request is signed by the signing certificate.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The One-Time Password Certificate Enrollment Protocol was designed to support [**OTP**](#gt_one-time-password-otp) authentication for [**DirectAccess**](#gt_directaccess).

The use of this protocol is appropriate as the basis for any network authentication scenario that involves sending a request with OTP credentials and a certificate enrollment request, and receiving a signed certificate enrollment request.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

For versioning control, a proprietary [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http) header "X-OTPCEP-version" is introduced and is mandatory in both the request and response. It is required to have the value of "1.0".

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

None.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The One-Time Password Certificate Enrollment Protocol does not provide its own secure transport. It MUST be transmitted over a secured channel, for example, [**Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Sockets Layer (HTTPS)**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-secure-https), as specified in [[RFC2818]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90383).

This protocol is encapsulated within and depends on [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http)**,** as specified in [[RFC2616]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90372), for delivery of messages. The protocol does not impose any message retransmissions or other requirements on this transport.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

This section contains common definitions used by this protocol. The protocol is [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http)-based protocol. "Content-type" header is always set to Application/xml;charset=utf-8. The syntax of the definitions uses the [**XML**](#gt_xml) schema as specified in [[XMLSCHEMA1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90608).

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Namespaces

This specification defines and references various [**XML namespaces**](#gt_xml-namespace) that are using the mechanisms specified in [[XMLNS-2ED]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90602). Although this document associates a specific XML namespace prefix for each XML namespace that is used, the choice of any particular XML namespace prefix is implementation-specific and not significant for interoperability.

Prefixes and XML namespaces used in this specification are as follows:

| Prefix | Namespace URI | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| xs | http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema | [[XMLSCHEMA1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90608) |
| otpcep | http://schemas.microsoft.com/otpcep/1.0/protocol | - |

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 SignCert Request

The **SignCert Request** is the message sent by a client when the end user is asked to provide [**OTP**](#gt_one-time-password-otp) credentials in order to perform OTP authentication.

The message MUST be a [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) [**XML**](#gt_xml) 1.0 document that uses the following [**XML namespace**](#gt_xml-namespace) as its default:

http://schemas.microsoft.com/otpcep/1.0/protocol

The XML document MUST contain a **signCertRequest** element. The message MUST NOT include additional data before or after the XML document. The XML document MAY contain trailing whitespace as part of the encoded content, as specified in [[XML]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90598) section 2.1.

<xs:element name="signCertRequest">

<xs:complexType>

<xs:attribute name="username" type="xs:string"

use="required" />

<xs:attribute name="oneTimePassword" type="xs:string"

use="required" />

<xs:attribute name="certRequest" type="otpcep:CertificateRequestBase64Binary"

use="required" />

</xs:complexType>

</xs:element>

The **signCertRequest** element contains the following attributes:

**username:** A NULL-terminated string that contains the user name.

**oneTimePassword:** A NULL-terminated string that contains the user's one-time credentials. The one-time credentials MUST contain an ever-changing one-time password (OTP) part. The one-time credentials MAY contain a static password (PIN) part.

**certRequest:** The certificate enrollment request in [**PKCS**](#gt_public-key-cryptography-standards-pkcs) #10 format ([[RFC2986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90401)). The request MUST be created by using the [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template) as defined in section [1.5](#Section_1.5).

The request MUST be digitally signed with a valid signature, as specified in [RFC2986].

<a id="Section_2.2.3"></a>
### 2.2.3 SignCert Response

A **SignCert Response** message is returned by the OTPCEP server as a response to a **SignCert Request** message (section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2)) received from the client.

The message MUST be a [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) [**XML**](#gt_xml) 1.0 document that uses the following [**XML namespace**](#gt_xml-namespace) as its default:

http://schemas.microsoft.com/otpcep/1.0/protocol

The document MUST contain a **signCertResponse** element. The message MUST NOT include additional data before or after the XML document. The XML document MAY contain trailing whitespace as part of the encoded content, as specified in [[XML]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90598) section 2.1.

<xs:complexType name="SignCertResponse">

<xs:sequence>

<xs:element name="IssuingCA" type="xs:anyURI" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" />

</xs:sequence>

<xs:attribute name="statusCode" type="otpcep:SignCertStatusCode" use="required" />

<xs:attribute name="SignedCertRequest" type="otpcep:CertificateBase64Binary" use="optional" />

</xs:complexType>

The **signCertResponse** element contains the following attributes:

**IssuingCA (optional):** If the user credentials are valid and the statusCode attribute equals Success, the names of one or more [**CA**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) servers from which the client enrolls the short-lived [**smart card**](#gt_smart-card) certificate are included in the **SignCert Response** message. Otherwise, this field MUST be empty.

## 3.1 Client Details

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

**Server Name:** A null-terminated [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) string that represents the name of the server the client can communicate with in order to authenticate the user and enroll certificates for accessing corporate resources. A list of strings representing available servers can be used for high availability.

**OTP Certificate Template Name:** A null-terminated string representing the name of the short-lived [**smart card**](#gt_smart-card) [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template) that is in use.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

None.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The Abstract Data Model (ADM) elements defined in section [3.1.1](#Section_3.2.1) are initialized during the client startup. They are configured by the administrator<2> and stored in persistent storage. On client startup, the configuration is read from the persistent storage and set in the ADM elements.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

The One-Time Password Certificate Enrollment Protocol is invoked when a user logs on to a client computer from outside the corporate network by using a username/password, [**smart card**](#gt_smart-card), or any other user credentials available for login, and then attempts to connect to a corporate resource using a connection that requires [**one-time password (OTP)**](#gt_one-time-password-otp) authentication. The client MUST create and send a **SignCert Request** message (section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2)), as specified in section [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2).

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>
#### 3.1.5.1 Creating A SignCert Request Message

When the user performs an [**OTP**](#gt_one-time-password-otp) authentication, the client performs the following steps.

- The client creates a **SignCert Request** message (section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2)) with the following attributes:
- The logon name of the user is set as the **username** attribute in the **SignCert Request** message. The name is in the domain\username format.
- The one-time credentials that the user provides after the logon are set in the **oneTimePassword** attribute of the **SignCert Request** message. The **oneTimePassword** attribute contains an ever-changing OTP part. The **oneTimePassword** attribure MAY contain a static password (PIN) part. The existence of the PIN part and the PIN and one-time password (OTP) concatenating format depend on the OTP vendor implementation.
- The client creates the certificate [**PKCS**](#gt_public-key-cryptography-standards-pkcs) #10 request, as specified in [[RFC2986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90401), by using the template referred by the **OTP Certificate Template Name** ADM element, and sets it as the **CertRequest** attribute in the **SignCert Request** message.
- The client sends the **SignCert Request** message to the server.
<a id="Section_3.1.5.2"></a>
#### 3.1.5.2 Processing A SignCert Response Message

Upon receiving the **SignCert Response** message (section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3)), the client MUST send an enrollment request to the [**Certification Authority (CA)**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) server using the signed certificate request, and MUST store the certificate issued by the CA using a [**key storage provider (KSP)**](#gt_key-storage-provider-ksp) to be used by the upper layer for authentication, thus enabling connectivity to the corporate resources.

If the **statusCode** attribute does not equal Success, the client fails the operation. The client MAY<3> display an error message to the user indicating that the operation failed.

### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

**OTP servers information:** A structure that represents the [**OTP**](#gt_one-time-password-otp) servers that are available for credentials validation on the server. The information in the structure MAY contain a server name or IP address, port, and other connectivity-related attributes. A sorted list of available servers can be used for high availability or load balancing.

**CA servers list:** A null-terminated [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) string that represents the names of the [**CAs**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) available for issuing OTP certificates. A sorted list of strings representing available CAs can be used for high availability or load balancing.

**Signing Certificate Template Name:** A null-terminated string representing the name of the signing [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template) that is in use.

<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1"></a>
#### 3.2.5.1 Processing A SignCert Request Message

Upon receiving a **SignCert Request** message (section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2)), the server performs the following steps:

- Validate the certificate request received in the **SignCert Request** message:
- The user name inside the certificate request MUST match the [**OTP**](#gt_one-time-password-otp) user name received in the **username** attribute of the **SignCert Request** message. If the user name appears in multiple places in the certificate request, all instances MUST match the OTP user name.
- The [**certificate template**](#gt_certificate-template) named in the user certificate request MUST NOT be empty and it MUST be the one that is configured in the server.
- The certificate request MUST be digitally signed with a valid signature, as specified in [[RFC2986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90401).
If the validations fail, the server MUST stop processing the request and send a **SignCert Response** message (section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3)) to the client with a status of OtherError, without setting the **SignedCertRequest** and **IssuingCA** attributes.

- Validate that the user name is listed in [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory), as specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md). If the validation fails, the server MUST stop processing the request and send a **SignCert Response** message to the client with a status of AuthenticationError, without setting the **SignedCertRequest** and **IssuingCA** attributes.
- Validate user name, static password (if available), and one-time password (OTP) with the first OTP server represented in the **OTP servers information** ADM element using the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) [[RFC1334]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=148311) over Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) to validate the OTP credentials. If the validation fails, the server MUST stop the processing and send a **SignCert Response** message with an error status corresponding to the response received from OTP server:
- If the OTP server cannot be reached, the server MUST send a status of OtherError to the client.
- If the response from the OTP server is Access-Reject, the server MUST send a status message of AuthenticationError to the client.
- If the response from OTP server is Challenge-Response, the server MUST send a status message of ChallengeResponseRequired to the client.
The **SignedCertRequest** and **IssuingCA** attributes are not set upon failure.

- Sign the certificate request that was part of the **SignCert Request** message using the dedicated signing certificate. If this operation fails, the server MUST send a status message of OtherError to the client.
The **SignedCertRequest** and **IssuingCA** attributes are not set upon failure.

- Verify that the list of [**CA**](#gt_certification-authority-ca) servers in the **CA servers list** ADM element is not empty and pick the first CA server from the list. If this operation fails, the server MUST send a status message of OtherError to the client.
- When a certificate is successfully signed, the server MUST create a **SignCert Response** message with the following values in it:
- The **statusCode** attribute is set to Success.
- The **SignedCertRequest** attribute value is set to the signed certificate enrollment request.
- The **IssuingCA** attribute is set to the name of the first or several high-ranked CA servers from the **CA servers list** ADM element.
Then the server MUST send the response back to the client.

# 5 Security

<a id="Section_5.1"></a>
## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

The One-Time Password Certificate Enrollment Protocol does not provide message-level signing or message-level encryption for either **SignCert Request** messages (section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2)) or **SignCert Response** messages (section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3)). Implementers can make use of available transport protection as available in [**HTTPS**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-secure-https) to provide security to the client/server interaction.

<a id="Section_5.2"></a>
## 5.2 Index of Security Parameters

None.
