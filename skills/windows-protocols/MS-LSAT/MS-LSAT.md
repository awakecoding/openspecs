# 1 Introduction

The Local Security Authority (Translation Methods) Remote Protocol is implemented in Windows products to translate identifiers for [**security principals**](#gt_security-principal) between human-readable and machine-readable forms. This translation can be used in scenarios such as human management of resource access.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_access-control-list-acl"></a>
**access control list (ACL)**: A list of access control entries (ACEs) that collectively describe the security rules for authorizing access to some resource; for example, an object or set of objects.

<a id="gt_acid"></a>
**ACID**: A term that refers to the four properties that any database system has to achieve in order to be considered transactional: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses LDAP as its primary access protocol. [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) stores information about a variety of objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md). [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is either deployed as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), which are both described in [MS-ADOD](../MS-ADOD/MS-ADOD.md): Active Directory Protocols Overview.

<a id="gt_discretionary-access-control-list-dacl"></a>
**discretionary access control list (DACL)**: An [**access control list (ACL)**](#gt_access-control-list-acl) that is controlled by the owner of an object and that specifies the access particular users or groups can have to the object.

<a id="gt_dns-name"></a>
**DNS name**: A fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

<a id="gt_domain"></a>
**domain**: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a [**domain controller (DC)**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) service. The domain controller provides authentication of members, creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD](../MS-AUTHSOD/MS-AUTHSOD.md) section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

<a id="gt_domain-controller-dc"></a>
**domain controller (DC)**: The service, running on a server, that implements [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory), or the server hosting this service. The service hosts the data store for objects and interoperates with other [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) to ensure that a local change to an object replicates correctly across all [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc). When [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is operating as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), the [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) contains full NC replicas of the configuration naming context (config NC), schema naming context (schema NC), and one of the [**domain NCs**](#gt_domain-naming-context-domain-nc) in its [**forest**](#gt_forest). If the AD DS [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) is a global catalog server (GC server), it contains partial NC replicas of the remaining [**domain NCs**](#gt_domain-naming-context-domain-nc) in its [**forest**](#gt_forest). For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5.2 and [MS-ADTS]. When [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is operating as Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), several AD LDS [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) can run on one server. When [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) is operating as AD DS, only one AD DS [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) can run on one server. However, several AD LDS [**DCs**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) can coexist with one AD DS [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) on one server. The AD LDS [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) contains full NC replicas of the config NC and the schema NC in its [**forest**](#gt_forest). The domain controller is the server side of Authentication Protocol Domain Support [MS-APDS](../MS-APDS/MS-APDS.md).

<a id="gt_domain-database"></a>
**domain database**: A database where security principal information is stored. This database is the directory service [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) in the case of a [**domain controller (DC)**](#gt_domain-controller-dc). On a machine that is not a [**DC**](#gt_domain-controller-dc), this database is a local database, manageable through the Security Accounts Manager Remote Protocol, as specified in [MS-SAMR](../MS-SAMR/MS-SAMR.md).

<a id="gt_domain-member-member-machine"></a>
**domain member (member machine)**: A machine that is joined to a domain by sharing a secret between the machine and the domain.

<a id="gt_domain-name"></a>
**domain name**: A domain name or a NetBIOS name that identifies a [**domain**](#gt_domain).

<a id="gt_domain-naming-context-domain-nc"></a>
**domain naming context (domain NC)**: A naming context (NC) whose replicas are able to contain [**security principal**](#gt_security-principal) objects. No other NC replica can contain [**security principal**](#gt_security-principal) objects. The distinguished name (DN) of a [**domain NC**](#gt_domain-naming-context-domain-nc) takes the form "dc=n1,dc=n2, ... dc=nk" where each "ni" satisfies the syntactic requirements of a DNS name component. For more information, see [[RFC1034]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90263). Such a DN corresponds to the domain naming service name: "n1.n2. ... .nk". This is the domain naming service name of the [**domain NC**](#gt_domain-naming-context-domain-nc). [**Domain NCs**](#gt_domain-naming-context-domain-nc) appear in the global catalog (GC). A [**forest**](#gt_forest) has one or more [**domain NCs**](#gt_domain-naming-context-domain-nc). The root of a [**domain NC**](#gt_domain-naming-context-domain-nc) is an object of class domainDns.

<a id="gt_forest"></a>
**forest**: In the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) directory service, a [**forest**](#gt_forest) is a set of naming contexts (NCs) consisting of one schema NC, one config NC, and one or more [**domain NCs**](#gt_domain-naming-context-domain-nc). Because a set of NCs can be arranged into a tree structure, a [**forest**](#gt_forest) is also a set of one or several trees of NCs.

<a id="gt_forest-trust"></a>
**forest trust**: A type of [**trust**](#gt_trust) where the trusted party is a [**forest**](#gt_forest), which means that all [**domains**](#gt_domain) in that [**forest**](#gt_forest) are trusted.

<a id="gt_local-security-authority-lsa"></a>
**Local Security Authority (LSA)**: A protected subsystem that authenticates and logs users onto the local system. [**LSA**](#gt_local-security-authority-lsa) also maintains information about all aspects of local security on a system, collectively known as the local security policy of the system.

<a id="gt_network-data-representation-ndr"></a>
**Network Data Representation (NDR)**: A specification that defines a mapping from Interface Definition Language (IDL) data types onto octet streams. [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr) also refers to the runtime environment that implements the mapping facilities (for example, data provided to [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr)). For more information, see [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) and [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) section 14.

<a id="gt_opnum"></a>
**opnum**: An operation number or numeric identifier that is used to identify a specific [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) method or a method in an interface. For more information, see [C706] section 12.5.2.12 or [MS-RPCE].

<a id="gt_relative-identifier-rid"></a>
**relative identifier (RID)**: The last item in the series of SubAuthority values in a [**security identifier (SID)**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) [[SIDD]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90516). It distinguishes one account or group from all other accounts and groups in the domain. No two accounts or groups in any domain share the same RID.

<a id="gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc"></a>
**remote procedure call (RPC)**: A communication protocol used primarily between client and server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message). For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_root-domain"></a>
**root domain**: The unique [**domain naming contexts (domain NCs)**](#gt_domain-naming-context-domain-nc) of an Active Directory [**forest**](#gt_forest) that is the parent of the [**forest's**](#gt_forest) config NC. The config NC's relative distinguished name (RDN) is "cn=Configuration" relative to the root object of the root domain. The root domain is the domain that is created first in a [**forest**](#gt_forest).

<a id="gt_rpc-client"></a>
**RPC client**: A computer on the network that sends messages using remote procedure call (RPC) as its transport, waits for responses, and is the initiator in an RPC exchange.

<a id="gt_rpc-dynamic-endpoint"></a>
**RPC dynamic endpoint**: A network-specific server address that is requested and assigned at run time, as described in [C706].

<a id="gt_rpc-endpoint"></a>
**RPC endpoint**: A network-specific address of a server process for remote procedure calls (RPCs). The actual name of the RPC endpoint depends on the RPC protocol sequence being used. For example, for the NCACN_IP_TCP RPC protocol sequence an RPC endpoint might be TCP port 1025. For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_rpc-protocol-sequence"></a>
**RPC protocol sequence**: A character string that represents a valid combination of a [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol, a network layer protocol, and a transport layer protocol, as described in [C706] and [MS-RPCE].

<a id="gt_rpc-server"></a>
**RPC server**: A computer on the network that waits for messages, processes them when they arrive, and sends responses using RPC as its transport acts as the responder during a remote procedure call (RPC) exchange.

<a id="gt_rpc-transport"></a>
**RPC transport**: The underlying network services used by the remote procedure call (RPC) runtime for communications between network nodes. For more information, see [C706] section 2.

<a id="gt_security-identifier-sid"></a>
**security identifier (SID)**: An identifier for [**security principals**](#gt_security-principal) that is used to identify an account or a group. Conceptually, the [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is composed of an account authority portion (typically a [**domain**](#gt_domain)) and a smaller integer representing an identity relative to the account authority, termed the [**relative identifier (RID)**](#gt_relative-identifier-rid). The [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) format is specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.4.2; a string representation of [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2 and [MS-AZOD](../MS-AZOD/MS-AZOD.md) section 1.1.1.2.

<a id="gt_security-principal"></a>
**security principal**: A unique entity, also referred to as a principal, that can be authenticated by [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory). It frequently corresponds to a human user, but also can be a service that offers a resource to other security principals. Other security principals might be a group, which is a set of principals. Groups are supported by [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory).

<a id="gt_server-message-block-smb"></a>
**Server Message Block (SMB)**: A protocol that is used to request file and print services from server systems over a network. The SMB protocol extends the CIFS protocol with additional security, file, and disk management support. For more information, see [[CIFS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109334) and [MS-SMB](../MS-SMB/MS-SMB.md).

<a id="gt_trust"></a>
**trust**: To accept another authority's statements for the purposes of authentication and authorization, especially in the case of a relationship between two domains. If [**domain**](#gt_domain) A trusts [**domain**](#gt_domain) B, [**domain**](#gt_domain) A accepts [**domain**](#gt_domain) B's authentication and authorization statements for principals represented by security principal objects in [**domain**](#gt_domain) B; for example, the list of groups to which a particular user belongs. As a noun, a [**trust**](#gt_trust) is the relationship between two [**domains**](#gt_domain) described in the previous sentence.

<a id="gt_trust-attributes"></a>
**trust attributes**: A collection of attributes that define different characteristics of a trust within a domain or a forest.

<a id="gt_trusted-domain"></a>
**trusted domain**: A domain that is trusted to make authentication decisions for security principals in that domain.

<a id="gt_trusted-forest"></a>
**trusted forest**: A forest that is trusted to make authentication statements for security principals in that forest. Assuming forest A trusts forest B, all domains belonging to forest A will trust all domains in forest B, subject to policy configuration.

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [C706] has to be used for generating the UUID.

<a id="gt_user-principal-name-upn"></a>
**user principal name (UPN)**: A user account name (sometimes referred to as the user logon name) and a domain name that identifies the domain in which the user account is located. This is the standard usage for logging on to a Windows domain. The format is: someone@example.com (in the form of an email address). In [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory), the userPrincipalName attribute of the account object, as described in [MS-ADTS].

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

The purpose of this protocol is to translate human-readable names to [**security identifiers (SIDs)**](#gt_security-identifier-sid), as specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.4.2, and vice versa. The syntax of human-readable names is specified in section [3.1.4.5](#Section_3.1.4.5). For example, this protocol can be used to translate "corp\John" to "S-1-5-21-397955417-626881126-188441444-1555", and vice versa.

This translation is needed for different scenarios, such as managing access to resources. In Windows, access to resources is controlled by a security descriptor attached to the resource. This security descriptor contains a list of SIDs indicating the [**security principals**](#gt_security-principal) and the kind of access allowed or denied for those principals. In order for humans to manage access to resources, translation occurs between SIDs (persisted within security descriptors) and human-readable identifiers (in the user interface).

This protocol is intended for use between any two machines, most frequently between a [**domain member**](#gt_domain-member-member-machine) and a [**domain controller (DC)**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) for that [**domain**](#gt_domain). This protocol can also be used between domain controllers for [**trusting**](#gt_trust) domains or [**forests**](#gt_forest).

This protocol is a simple request/response-based [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol. There are no long-lived sessions, although clients are free to cache the RPC connection and reuse it over time. A sample sequence of requests and responses is shown in section [4](#Section_4).

## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

![The relationships among the LSAT, LSAD, RPC, and SMB protocols](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: The relationships among the LSAT, LSAD, RPC, and SMB protocols

The Local Security Authority (Translation Methods) Remote Protocol is composed of a subset of [**opnums**](#gt_opnum) in an interface that also includes the Local Security Authority (Domain Policy) Remote Protocol, as specified in [MS-LSAD](../MS-LSAD/MS-LSAD.md).

The Local Security Authority (Translation Methods) Remote Protocol is dependent upon [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc), which is used to communicate between [**domain members**](#gt_6234a38c-ed1b-4c69-969f-6e6479566f65) and [**domain controllers**](#gt_domain-controller-dc).

This protocol depends on the [**Server Message Block (SMB)**](#gt_server-message-block-smb) Protocol [MS-SMB](../MS-SMB/MS-SMB.md) and the TCP/IP protocol for sending messages on the wire.

Some messages in this protocol depend on the Netlogon Remote Protocol, as specified in [MS-NRPC](../MS-NRPC/MS-NRPC.md), having successfully negotiated security parameters to be used. For more information on the messages that have this requirement, see section [3.1.4](#Section_3.1.4).

The Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol, as specified in [MS-DRSR](../MS-DRSR/MS-DRSR.md), exposes functionality similar to what this protocol achieves, but serves a different purpose. The DRS Remote Protocol can translate names in different syntaxes, but lacks the functionality to translate names from different [**forests**](#gt_forest). An application uses one or both protocols, depending on the syntax of names for which the application requires translation.

The Security Account Manager (SAM) Remote Protocol (Client-to-Server), as specified in [MS-SAMR](../MS-SAMR/MS-SAMR.md), exposes similar functionality for [**security principals**](#gt_security-principal) that are local to a server.

The Active Directory Technical Specification [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) discusses [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory), which is used by this protocol.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

This protocol has prerequisites, specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md), that are common to protocols that depend on [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc).

As previously noted, some messages in this protocol depend on the Netlogon Remote Protocol, as specified in [MS-NRPC](../MS-NRPC/MS-NRPC.md), having successfully negotiated security parameters to be used. For more information on the messages that have this requirement, see section [3.1.4](#Section_3.1.4).

It is assumed that the [**RPC server**](#gt_rpc-server) has access to the distributed abstract databases specified in section [3.1.1](#Section_3.1.1) that are required to perform the translations requested using this protocol. It is also assumed that the RPC server has created the required views, as specified in section 3.1.1.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is applicable whenever there is a need to translate the human-readable names of [**security principals**](#gt_security-principal), with syntaxes described in section [3.1.4.5](#Section_3.1.4.5), to security principal [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid), or vice versa. This applicability includes, but is not limited to, an end-user administration program that displays and controls who can access such resources as files.

To understand the conditions under which this protocol is preferred over other protocols, see section [1.4](#Section_1.4).

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

- Supported Transports: The protocol uses [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over [**SMB**](#gt_server-message-block-smb) and TCP/IP, as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).
- Protocol Version: This protocol's RPC interface has a single version number, but that interface has been extended by adding methods at the end. The use of these methods is specified in section [3.1](#Section_3.1).
- Structure Version: The [LSAPR_ACL (section 2.2.3)](#Section_2.2.3) and [LSAPR_SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR (section 2.2.5)](#Section_2.2.5) structures are versioned using the first field in the structure. The structure version is not used in this protocol.
- Capabilities: The [**RPC client**](#gt_rpc-client) passes its capabilities in the appropriate parameter when possible, as specified in sections [3.1.4.5](#Section_3.1.4.5), [3.1.4.6](#Section_3.1.4.6), [3.1.4.7](#Section_3.1.4.7), [3.1.4.9](#Section_3.1.4.9), and [3.1.4.10](#Section_3.1.4.10).
The [**RPC server**](#gt_rpc-server) takes actions according to the capabilities parameter of an RPC message, if present, as specified in the previous paragraph.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol uses NTSTATUS values as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.3. Vendors are free to choose their own values for this field, provided that the C bit (0x20000000) is set, which indicates that it is a customer code.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

This protocol has no standards assignments. It uses private allocations for the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interface [**universally unique identifier (UUID)**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid) (12345778-1234-ABCD-EF00-0123456789AB) and the [**RPC endpoint**](#gt_rpc-endpoint) (\PIPE\lsarpc).

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

This protocol uses the following [**RPC protocol sequences**](#gt_rpc-protocol-sequence):

- [**SMB**](#gt_server-message-block-smb)
- TCP/IP<1>
This protocol MUST use [**RPC dynamic endpoints**](#gt_rpc-dynamic-endpoint), as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) section 4, when using [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over TCP/IP.

This protocol MUST use "\PIPE\lsarpc" as the [**RPC endpoint**](#gt_rpc-endpoint) when using RPC over SMB.<2>

[**RPC clients**](#gt_rpc-client) for this protocol MUST use RPC over SMB for the [LsarOpenPolicy2](#Section_3.1.4.1), [LsarOpenPolicy](#Section_3.1.4.2), [LsarClose](#Section_3.1.4.3), [LsarGetUserName](#Section_3.1.4.4), [LsarLookupNames](#Section_3.1.4.8), [LsarLookupNames2](#Section_3.1.4.7), [LsarLookupNames3](#Section_3.1.4.6), [LsarLookupSids](#Section_3.1.4.9), and [LsarLookupSids2](#Section_3.1.4.10) methods. RPC clients MUST use RPC over TCP/IP for the [LsarLookupNames4](#Section_3.1.4.5) and [LsarLookupSids3](#Section_3.1.4.9) methods.<3>

The server SHOULD<4> reject calls that do not use an authentication level of RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_NONE, RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_INTEGRITY, or RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY ([MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.2.1.1.8).

This protocol MUST use the [**UUID**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid) and version number as follows:

- UUID: See section [1.9](#Section_1.9).
- Version number: 0.0.
Security settings used in this protocol vary depending on the role of the RPC client and [**RPC server**](#gt_rpc-server), the method being used, and the specific parameters being used. Therefore, security settings are discussed in the message processing sections for each message.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Common Data Types

In addition to [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) base types and definitions specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md), additional data types are defined in this specification.

Some fields of some data types were introduced into the protocol but not used. These data types and fields are not to be confused with those that were introduced for extensibility. These fields MUST NOT be used for extensibility. Such fields are described as follows:

"This field MUST be ignored. The content is unspecified, and no requirements are placed on its value since it is never used."

The server SHOULD place no constraints on the value present in such fields unless otherwise stated.

This protocol MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to support both the [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr) and NDR64 transfer syntaxes and provide a negotiation mechanism for determining which transfer syntax will be used, as specified in [C706] section 12 and in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.3.1.5.6.

## 2.3 Directory Service Schema Elements

This protocol is part of the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) core family of protocols. In order to be fully compliant with Active Directory, an implementation of this protocol must be used in conjunction with the full Active Directory schema, containing all the schema attributes and classes specified in [MS-ADA1](../MS-ADA1/MS-ADA1.md), [MS-ADA2](../MS-ADA2/MS-ADA2.md), [MS-ADA3](../MS-ADA3/MS-ADA3.md), and [MS-ADSC](../MS-ADSC/MS-ADSC.md).

<a id="Section_3"></a>
# 3 Protocol Details

This protocol determines whether it is running on a [**domain controller**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) by querying the current server configuration. This is accomplished by calling the abstract interface ServerGetInfo, specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.6, and indicating a *level* of 101. The resulting *bufptr* contains a SERVER_INFO_101 structure, as specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.3.12. The determination is TRUE if **sv101_version_type** contains SV_TYPE_DOMAIN_CTRL or SV_TYPE_DOMAIN_BAKCTRL. If **sv101_version_type** does not contain either of these values, the determination is FALSE.

## 3.1 Server Details

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a possible data organization that an implementation might maintain to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to help explain how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with what is described in this document.

The server implementing this protocol MUST create views, as specified in section [3.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.1.1), over [**domain databases**](#gt_domain-database) that the server [**trusts**](#gt_trust) to be able to translate [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) to names, and vice versa. These views contain SIDs and different types of names, as well as the [**domain**](#gt_domain) to which each [**security principal**](#gt_security-principal) belongs. These views MUST be kept in sync with the original databases whose data is used to create the view. The sync mechanism is implementation-specific, and there is no upper bound on the time from when a change occurs in a domain database to when that change appears in the view. A scoping parameter defined as [LSAP_LOOKUP_LEVEL](#Section_2.2.16) can be considered during message processing by applying these views to different databases.

The following domain databases are used in this protocol.

- [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory), specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).
- The Local Security Authority (LSA) Domain Policy database, specified in [MS-LSAD](../MS-LSAD/MS-LSAD.md).
- The Service Control Manager database, specified in [MS-SCMR](../MS-SCMR/MS-SCMR.md).
- The Predefined Translation database, specified in section [3.1.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.1.1.1).
The domain databases MUST satisfy [**ACID**](#gt_acid) properties [GRAY] during creation or updates of views.

The abstract data models presented in sections [3.1.1.2](#Section_3.1.1.2) and [3.1.1.3](#Section_3.1.1.3) are used along with domain database information to construct the logical views specified in section 3.1.1.1. The views, in turn, are used to process mapping requests. This process is specified in sections [3.1.4.4](#Section_3.1.4.4), [3.1.4.5](#Section_3.1.4.5), and [3.1.4.9](#Section_3.1.4.9), which describe the server processing of [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) messages.

In this section, Active Directory schema names are referenced when describing attributes stored in the domain database. For more information, see [MS-ADSC](../MS-ADSC/MS-ADSC.md), [MS-ADA1](../MS-ADA1/MS-ADA1.md), [MS-ADA2](../MS-ADA2/MS-ADA2.md), and [MS-ADA3](../MS-ADA3/MS-ADA3.md).

<a id="Section_3.1.1.1"></a>
#### 3.1.1.1 Database Views

The following names represent the columns of the views that are specified in this section:

- **Domain DNS Name**
- **Domain NetBIOS Name**
- **Domain SID**
- **Security Principal Name**
- **Additional Security Principal Name**
- **Default User Principal Names**
- **User Principal Name**
- **Security Principal SID**
- **Security Principal SID History**
- **Security Principal Type**
**Domain SID**, **Security Principal Name**, **Security Principal SID**, and **Security Principal Type** are mandatory columns that MUST have values, while the rest MAY have values.

Some views are populated with constants, while others are populated by extracting current information from various [**domain databases**](#gt_domain-database). The specific views and how they are populated are described in the following paragraphs and subsections.

When a view is populated by extracting current information from the domain database of a selected [**domain**](#gt_domain), and the database or a replica of the database is local to the server, the server MUST use the local values. If the security database or a replica is not local, the server MUST use values from a remote replica. For remote values, there are no consistency guarantees from call to call; that is, the view might contain values from a different remote replica on each call.

The following assumptions are made for all views:

- **Security Principal SID** forms a unique key for each row.
- The **Security Principal Name** and **Domain NetBIOS Name** pair forms a unique key for each row.
- If **Domain DNS Name** is not empty, the **Security Principal Name** and **Domain DNS Name** pair forms a unique key for each row.
- If **Additional Security Principal Name** is not empty, the **Additional Security Principal Name** and **Domain NetBIOS Name** pair forms a unique key for each row.
- If **Additional Security Principal Name** and **Domain DNS Name** are not empty, the **Additional Security Principal Name** and **Domain DNS Name** pair forms a unique key for each row.
These assumptions MUST be held true by the database implementations from which these views are created.<17>

<a id="Section_3.1.1.1.1"></a>
##### 3.1.1.1.1 Predefined Translation Database and Corresponding View

The Predefined Translation View MUST be constructed using the following non-customizable Predefined Translation Tables. There is a one-to-one mapping between the rows in the view and the rows in the tables. The columns that are not mentioned in these tables are empty. The tables are grouped by the Domain NetBIOS Name and Domain SID columns for easier understanding.

Values of the Domain NetBIOS Name and Security Principal Name columns are shown in U.S. English. In an actual system, these values MUST be localized to the language defined as system locale at the time of message processing.

##### 3.1.1.1.2 Configurable Translation Database and Corresponding View

The Configurable Translation Database is a general purpose database for translation between [**security principal**](#gt_security-principal) names and their corresponding [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid). The Configurable Translation Database columns are the same as the Predefined Translation Database columns, and the view construction is the same. This database SHOULD be constructed using the abstract data model specified in [MS-SCMR](../MS-SCMR/MS-SCMR.md) section 3.1.1. There MUST be one row for the "NT SERVICE" [**domain**](#gt_domain), as defined in the following table. There MUST be one row per service definition. The mapping rules are defined as follows:

- For all these entries: Domain DNS Name, Additional Security Principal Name, User Principal Name, Default User Principal Names, and Security Principal SID, the History columns are left empty.
- For the "NT SERVICE" domain entry, the mapping rules are defined as follows:
- Security Principal Name is “NT SERVICE”
- Service Principal SID is S-1-5-80
- Security Principal Type is SidTypeDomain
- For each service definition entry, the mapping rules are defined as follows:
- Security Principal Name is mapped from the **ServiceName** in [MS-SCMR] section 3.1.1.
- Security Principal SID is mapped from the **ServiceName** in [MS-SCMR] section 3.1.1 using the following method:
- Convert the **ServiceName** field to the uppercase, UTF-16 representation.
- Take the SHA1 hash of the name:
- Hash[0] denoting the first 4 bytes of the resulting hash as an unsigned integer.
- Hash[1] denoting the second 4 bytes of the resulting hash as an unsigned integer.
- And so on.
- Create the SID using the following mapping:
- S-1-5-80-hash[0]-hash[1]-hash[2]-hash[3]-hash[4]
- Security Principal Type is mapped to SidTypeWellKnownGroup.
The following table shows two columns in the Configurable Translation Database and Corresponding View as an example with the NT Service Domain and Service Name 'ALG'.

**Domain NetBIOS Name: NT SERVICE**

**Domain SID: S-1-5-80**

| **Security Principal Name** | **Security Principal SID** | **Security Principal Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NT SERVICE | S-1-5-80 | SidTypeDomain |
| ALG | S-1-5-80-2387347252-3645287876-2469496166-3824418187-3586569773 | SidTypeWellKnownGroup |

- sAMAccountType
- objectSID
All objects that satisfy the following criteria MUST be part of this view:

- All three columns in the preceding list MUST have values.
- The value of the objectSID attribute MUST contain S-1-5-32 as its prefix.
The columns of such objects MUST be used to construct the Builtin Domain Principal View in the following manner:

- Domain DNS Name, Additional Security Principal Name, User Principal Name, Default User Principal Names, and Security Principal SID History columns are left empty.
- Security Principal SID is mapped from objectSID.
- Security Principal Name is mapped from sAMAccountName.
- Security Principal Type is mapped from sAMAccountType by using the following table.
| Bit Range | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable | 0x3 | SidTypeUser |
| Variable | 0x1 | SidTypeGroup |
| Variable | 0x4 or 0x2: These values are treated identically by the protocol. | SidTypeAlias |
| Variable | Otherwise | SidTypeUnknown |

- Domain NetBIOS Name and Domain SID are mapped from the row of the Predefined Translation Database View whose [**security principal**](#gt_security-principal) [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is S-1-5-32.
The following is an example of how this view is created:

- An object that represents the administrators group.
| Column | Value |
| --- | --- |
| sAMAccountName | Administrators |
| sAMAccountType | 0x20000000 |
| objectSID | S-1-5-32-544 |

- Security Principal SID is mapped from objectSID.
- Security Principal Name is mapped from sAMAccountName.
- Security Principal Type is mapped from sAMAccountType by using the mapping rule explained in the Builtin Domain Principal View (section [3.1.1.1.3](#Section_3.1.1.1.3)).
- Domain NetBIOS Name, Domain DNS Name, and Domain SID are mapped from Domain Database Information, as specified in section [3.1.1.2](#Section_3.1.1.2).
- Default User Principal Names is constructed using the following rules:
- If Domain DNS Name is not empty, concatenate sAMAccountName with Domain DNS Name, separated by an @ sign.
- And if the domain database used is an [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) [**domain**](#gt_domain), concatenate sAMAccountName with Domain NetBIOS Name, separated by an @ sign.
The following is an example of how this view is created:

<a id="Section_3.1.1.1.8"></a>
##### 3.1.1.1.8 Forest Information View

The Forest Information View of a [**forest**](#gt_forest) is a union of Account Domain Information Views of all [**domains**](#gt_domain) in that forest.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.1.9"></a>
##### 3.1.1.1.9 Forest View

This view for a given [**forest**](#gt_forest) is a union of Forest Information View and Forest Principal View for that forest.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.2"></a>
#### 3.1.1.2 Domain Database Information

Domain database information MUST consist of the following conceptual fields:

- **Domain DNS Name**: A Unicode string that contains the [**DNS name**](#gt_dns-name) of the [**domain database**](#gt_domain-database).
- **Domain NetBIOS Name**: A Unicode string that contains the NetBIOS name of the domain database.
- **Domain SID**: The [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) of the domain database.
When the domain database is an [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) domain database, this information MUST be populated from DNS Domain Information, as specified in [MS-LSAD](../MS-LSAD/MS-LSAD.md) section 3.1.1.1.

Otherwise, this information MUST be populated from the Account Domain Information, as specified in [MS-LSAD] section 3.1.1.1. In this case, **Domain DNS Name** MUST be set to empty.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.3"></a>
#### 3.1.1.3 Trusted Domains and Forests Information

The Local Security Authority (LSA) Domain Policy database, as specified in [MS-LSAD](../MS-LSAD/MS-LSAD.md), contains [**trust**](#gt_trust) information for a given [**domain**](#gt_domain) and [**forest**](#gt_forest). Of all the information that it manages for trusts, only the following conceptual columns are of interest to this protocol:

- **Trusted Domain DNS Name**: The [**DNS name**](#gt_dns-name) of the [**trusted domain**](#gt_trusted-domain).
- **Trusted Domain NetBIOS Name**: The NetBIOS name of the same domain.
- **Domain SID**: The [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) of the same domain.
- **Trust Direction**: Indicates whether the trust is inbound, outbound, or both.
- **Trust Type**: Type of the trust.
- **Trust Attributes**: Additional characteristics of the trust.
- **Forest Trust Information**: Attributes of this trust as it pertains to the forest.
In the [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory), **Trusted Domain DNS Name** is stored in the trustPartner attribute, **Trusted Domain NetBIOS Name** in flatName, **Trust Direction** in trustDirection, **Trust Type** in trustType, **Trust Attributes** in trustAttributes as a bitmask, and **Forest Trust Information** in msDs-trustForestTrustInfo.

Trust information that satisfies the following criteria MUST be used by this protocol:

- Trust Type is a Windows trust, which means that the trusted party is a Windows domain, as specified in [MS-LSAD]. A Windows trust is represented by a value of 0x0000002 in the trustType attribute. **Trust Attributes** can declare a trust to be a [**forest trust**](#gt_forest-trust) by having the 0x00000008 bit set in the trustAttributes attribute, as specified in [MS-LSAD]. For more information, see [MS-ADSC](../MS-ADSC/MS-ADSC.md), [MS-ADA1](../MS-ADA1/MS-ADA1.md), [MS-ADA2](../MS-ADA2/MS-ADA2.md), and [MS-ADA3](../MS-ADA3/MS-ADA3.md).
- Trust Direction is outbound or bidirectional, as specified in [MS-LSAD].
The NetBIOS and DNS names of the trusted domain can be used to locate a [**domain NC**](#gt_domain-naming-context-domain-nc) "replica" for that domain by using a [**domain controller**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) locator algorithm, an example of which is described in [MS-ADOD](../MS-ADOD/MS-ADOD.md) sections 2.7.7.3.1 and 3.1.1.

The [**trust attributes**](#gt_trust-attributes) declare the trust to be a forest trust, as specified in [MS-LSAD] section 3.1.1.5, if and only if the following conditions are met:

- The trusted domain information satisfies the preceding criteria.
- The trusted domain information is in the [**root domain**](#gt_root-domain) of the forest.
If the trust attributes declare the trust to be a forest trust, the Forest Trust Information column contains information about the [**trusted forest**](#gt_trusted-forest). Specifically, this information consists of a [**domain name**](#gt_domain-name), a domain DNS name, and the domain SID of all domains in the forest, as well as top-level names, including [**UPN**](#gt_user-principal-name-upn) suffixes for user principal names, as specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 6.1.6 and [MS-LSAD] section 3.1.1.5.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

No protocol timers are required other than the internal ones used in [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) to implement resiliency to network outages, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The server MUST start listening on the well-known named pipe for the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interface, as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1). The server SHOULD register the RPC interface to listen over TCP/IP.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

This section specifies the methods for this protocol, in addition to their processing rules.<21><22>

This protocol contains some methods with parameters that have no effect on message processing in any environment. These are called out as "ignored".

**Note** This protocol shares an interface with the Local Security Authority (Domain Policy) Remote Protocol, as specified in [MS-LSAD](../MS-LSAD/MS-LSAD.md).

**Note** Gaps in the [**opnum**](#gt_opnum) numbering sequence represent opnums of methods that are documented in [MS-LSAD], or opnums that MUST NOT<23> be used over the wire.

No exceptions SHOULD be thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

The return values of all methods MUST conform to the specification of NTSTATUS, as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.3. Specific return values for normative processing conditions are specified in this document in the subsections of this section.

Unless otherwise specified, all negative values returned by an implementation are treated equivalently by the client as a message processing error. Unless otherwise specified, all non-negative values returned by an implementation are treated equivalently by the client as a success (of message processing).

Return values for implementation-specific conditions are left to the implementer's discretion, subject to the constraints specified in [MS-ERREF]. For example, an implementation can re-use an existing value in [MS-ERREF], such as 0xC0000017 (no memory).

The RPC methods shown in the following sections are organized in the following order:

- Methods that allow a client to open and close a connection.
- Methods that translate given names to SIDs.
- Methods that translate SIDs to names.
<a id="Section_3.1.4.1"></a>
#### 3.1.4.1 LsarOpenPolicy2 (Opnum 44)

The LsarOpenPolicy2 method opens a context handle to the [**RPC server**](#gt_rpc-server).

NTSTATUS LsarOpenPolicy2(

[in, unique, string] wchar_t* SystemName,

[in] PLSAPR_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES ObjectAttributes,

[in] ACCESS_MASK DesiredAccess,

[out] LSAPR_HANDLE* PolicyHandle

);

Processing rules for this message are defined in [MS-LSAD](../MS-LSAD/MS-LSAD.md) section 3.1.4.4.1.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.2"></a>
#### 3.1.4.2 LsarOpenPolicy (Opnum 6)

The LsarOpenPolicy method is exactly the same as [LsarOpenPolicy2](#Section_3.1.4.1), except that the *SystemName* parameter in this method contains only one character instead of a full string. This is because its syntactical definition lacks the [string] [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) annotation present in LsarOpenPolicy2, as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824). RPC data types are specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.2.4.1.

The *SystemName* parameter has no effect on message processing in any environment. It MUST be ignored.

NTSTATUS LsarOpenPolicy(

[in, unique] wchar_t* SystemName,

[in] PLSAPR_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES ObjectAttributes,

[in] ACCESS_MASK DesiredAccess,

[out] LSAPR_HANDLE* PolicyHandle

);

Processing rules for this message are defined in [MS-LSAD](../MS-LSAD/MS-LSAD.md) section 3.1.4.4.2.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.3"></a>
#### 3.1.4.3 LsarClose (Opnum 0)

The LsarClose method frees the resources held by a context handle that was opened earlier. After response, the context handle is no longer usable, and any subsequent uses of this handle MUST fail.

NTSTATUS LsarClose(

[in, out] LSAPR_HANDLE* ObjectHandle

);

Processing rules for this message are defined in [MS-LSAD](../MS-LSAD/MS-LSAD.md) section 3.1.4.9.4.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.4"></a>
#### 3.1.4.4 LsarGetUserName (Opnum 45)

The LsarGetUserName method returns the name and the [**domain name**](#gt_domain-name) of the [**security principal**](#gt_security-principal) that is invoking the method.

NTSTATUS LsarGetUserName(

[in, unique, string] wchar_t* SystemName,

[in, out] PRPC_UNICODE_STRING* UserName,

[in, out, unique] PRPC_UNICODE_STRING* DomainName

);

**SystemName:** This parameter has no effect on message processing in any environment. It MUST be ignored.

**UserName:** On return, contains the name of the security principal that is making the call. The string MUST be of the form sAMAccountName. On input, this parameter MUST be ignored. The RPC_UNICODE_STRING structure is defined in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.3.10.

**DomainName:** On return, contains the domain name of the security principal that is invoking the method. This string MUST be a NetBIOS name. On input, this parameter MUST be ignored.

**Return Values:** The following table contains a summary of the return values that an implementation MUST return, as specified by the message processing shown after the table.

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 STATUS_SUCCESS | The request was successfully completed. |
| 0xC0000022 STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED | The caller does not have the permissions to perform this operation. |

The server MUST determine the [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) of the caller; to do so, the server MUST invoke the GetRpcImpersonationAccessToken abstract interface ([MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.3.3.4.3.1).

If GetRpcImpersonationAccessToken succeeds, the server MUST use the SID in the Token.Sids[OwnerIndex] element ([MS-DTYP] section 2.5.2) for further processing.

If GetRpcImpersonationAccessToken fails, the server MUST use the ANONYMOUS SID ([MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2.4) for further processing.

The server MUST locate the security principal that is making the request using the SID that was determined previously. To do so, a search MUST be performed in the following views and MUST end as soon as the security principal is located in some view:

- Predefined Translation View.
- Configurable Translation View.
- Account Domain View of the account database served on that machine.
- If the machine is not joined to a [**domain**](#gt_domain), the search ends here.
- If this machine is not a [**domain controller**](#gt_domain-controller-dc): Account Domain View of the domain to which this machine is joined.
- Forest View of the [**forest**](#gt_forest) of the domain to which this machine is joined.
- Forest Views of [**trusted forests**](#gt_trusted-forest) for the forest of the domain to which this machine is joined.
- Account Domain Views of externally [**trusted domains**](#gt_trusted-domain) for the domain to which this machine is joined.
After the security principal is located, the [**RPC server**](#gt_rpc-server) MUST return the security principal name in the *UserName* parameter and MUST return the domain NetBIOS name in the *DomainName* parameter if *DomainName* is not NULL. The return value MUST be set to STATUS_SUCCESS in this case. In other cases, an implementation-specific negative value MUST be returned.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.5"></a>
#### 3.1.4.5 LsarLookupNames4 (Opnum 77)

The LsarLookupNames4 method translates a batch of [**security principal**](#gt_security-principal) names to their [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) form. It also returns the [**domains**](#gt_domain) of which these security principals are a part.

NTSTATUS LsarLookupNames4(

**RpcHandle:** This value is used by [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) internally and is not transmitted over the network, as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824). This handle can be obtained by calling RPC runtime binding routines. For more information, see [[MSDN-RPCDB]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90076).

**Count:** Number of security principal names to look up.<24>

**Names:** Contains the security principal names to translate. The RPC_UNICODE_STRING structure is defined in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.3.10.

The following name forms MUST be supported:

- [**User principal names (UPNs)**](#gt_user-principal-name-upn), such as user_name@example.example.com.
- Fully qualified account names based on either DNS or NetBIOS names. For example: example.example.com\user_name or example\user_name, where the generalized form is domain\user account name, and domain is either the fully qualified [**DNS name**](#gt_dns-name) or the NetBIOS name of the [**trusted domain**](#gt_trusted-domain).
- Unqualified or isolated names, such as user_name.
The comparisons used by the [**RPC server**](#gt_rpc-server) MUST NOT be case-sensitive, so case for inputs is not important.

**ReferencedDomains:** On successful return, contains the domain information for the domain to which each security principal belongs. The domain information includes a NetBIOS domain name and a domain SID for each entry in the list.

**TranslatedSids:** On successful return, contains the corresponding SID form for security principal names in the *Names* parameter. It MUST be ignored on input.

**LookupLevel:** Specifies what scopes are to be used during translation, as specified in section [2.2.16](#Section_2.2.16).

**MappedCount:** On successful return, contains the number of names that are translated completely to the SID form. This parameter is left as an input parameter for backward compatibility and has no effect on message processing in any environment. It MUST be ignored on input.

**LookupOptions:** Flags specified by the caller that control the lookup operation. The value MUST be one of the following.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 | Isolated names are searched for even when they are not on the local computer. |
| 0x80000000 | Isolated names (except for user principal names (UPNs)) are searched for only on the local account database. UPNs are not searched for in any of the views. |

**ClientRevision:** Version of the client, which implies the client's capabilities. The value MUST be one of the following.<25>

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000001 | The client does not understand DNS domain names and is not aware that it might be part of a [**forest**](#gt_forest). |
| 0x00000002 | The client understands DNS domain names and is aware that it might be part of a forest. Error codes returned can include STATUS_TRUSTED_DOMAIN_FAILURE and STATUS_TRUSTED_RELATIONSHIP_FAILURE, which are not returned for *ClientRevision* of 0x00000001. For more information on error codes, see [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md). |

Values smaller than 0x00000002 SHOULD be assumed to be 0x00000001, and other values SHOULD be assumed to be 0x00000002.

**Return Values:** The following table contains a summary of the return values that an implementation MUST return, as specified by the message processing shown after the table.

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 STATUS_SUCCESS | The request was successfully completed. |
| 0x00000107 STATUS_SOME_NOT_MAPPED | Some of the information to be translated has not been translated. |
| 0xC00000DC STATUS_INVALID_SERVER_STATE | The RPC server is not a [**domain controller**](#gt_domain-controller-dc). |
| 0xC0000022 STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED | The caller does not have the permissions to perform this operation. |
| 0xC000000D STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER | One of the supplied parameters was invalid. |
| 0xC0000073 STATUS_NONE_MAPPED | None of the information to be translated has been translated. |

This message is valid only if the RPC server is a domain controller. The RPC server MUST return STATUS_INVALID_SERVER_STATE in the return value if it is not a domain controller.

The RPC server MUST ensure that one of the following conditions is true:

- The RPC_C_AUTHN_NETLOGON security provider (as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.2.1.1.7) and at least RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_INTEGRITY authentication level (as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 2.2.1.1.8) are used in this RPC message.
- The RPC client token contains one of the following well-known SID types - DOMAIN_GROUP_RID_COMPUTERS, DOMAIN_GROUP_RID_CONTROLLERS, DOMAIN_GROUP_RID_READONLY_CONTROLLERS (as specified in [MS-SAMR](../MS-SAMR/MS-SAMR.md) section 2.2.1.14).<26>
Otherwise, the RPC server MUST return STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED.

The RPC server MUST check each element in the *Names* parameter for validity, as described for the RPC_UNICODE_STRING structure in [MS-DTYP] section 2.3.10. If validation fails, the RPC server MUST return STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.

The *TranslatedSids* and *MappedCount* parameters are left as input parameters for backward compatibility and have no effect on message processing in any environment. They MUST be ignored on input.

*LookupOptions* MUST NOT contain 0x80000000 unless *LookupLevel* is LsapLookupWksta. If this fails, the RPC server MUST return STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.

A name is interchangeably called a "qualified" or "composite" name if the name has a backslash ('\') character in it. The string before the backslash is assumed to be the domain name, and the string after the backslash is the name to be resolved within that domain. If the name does not contain a backslash character, it is called an "isolated" name. An isolated name can be in single-label form, as in "John", or can be in user-principal-name form, as in "John@example.com".

The RPC server MUST match a name with a row in the view by using the following rules:

- If the name is a qualified name, the domain name MUST match the Domain NetBIOS Name column or Domain DNS Name column, and the name MUST match the Security Principal Name column. Note that there cannot be multiple matches in this case (see section [3.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.1.1)). A domain name match against the Domain DNS Name column MUST NOT be performed if *ClientRevision* is 0x00000001 and the machine is joined to a mixed mode domain, as specified in [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 6.1.4.1.
- If the name is an isolated name:
- If in single-label form, the name MUST match the Security Principal Name column or the Additional Security Principal Name column.
- If there are multiple matches due to a search in multiple domains, which can happen in Forest Views, any one of the matches MAY be used to satisfy the request, as long as a consistent search order is followed.
- If in user principal name form, the name SHOULD<27> match the User Principal Name column or the Default User Principal Names column.
- If there are multiple matches on the User Principal Name attribute, the match MUST fail.
- If there is one match with User Principal Name and one match with Default User Principal Names, the match with the User Principal Name attribute MUST take precedence.
- There cannot be multiple Default User Principal Names matches; see section 3.1.1.1.
The search scope is defined by the *LookupLevel* parameter. The RPC server MUST search only the scopes that are defined by the *LookupLevel* parameter and MUST NOT return matches defined outside that scope. The scopes to search when processing this message are specified in section 2.2.16.

When a name is matched in the database, or when the domain name of a composite name is matched in the database, the *ReferencedDomains* parameter MUST be searched for an entry that is identical to the following: The **Name** field contains the value from the Domain NetBIOS Name column, and the **Sid** field contains the value from the Domain SID column. If there is no such entry, a new entry with the **Name** field containing the value of the Domain NetBIOS Name and the **Sid** field containing the value of the Domain SID MUST be created and added to the *ReferencedDomains* list.

Output parameters MUST be updated using the following information:

- For a successful search, the corresponding *TranslatedSids* entry MUST be updated as follows:
- Use: Security Principal Type column
- Sid: Security Principal SID column
- Flags:
- 0x00000001: If the search is not satisfied by matching against the Security Principal Name column. Also see the paragraph after step 3.
- 0x00000004: If the search is satisfied by a comparison that uses the view specified in section [3.1.1.1.2](#Section_3.1.1.1.2), Configurable Translation Database and Corresponding View. Also see the paragraph after step 3.
- DomainIndex: Index of the domain in the *ReferencedDomains* parameter.
- If a match cannot be found for a name, the corresponding *TranslatedSids* entry MUST be updated with:
- Use: SidTypeUnknown
- Sid: NULL
- Flags: 0x00000000 (also see the paragraph after step 3)
- DomainIndex: -1
- If a match cannot be found for a composite name, but the domain name within the composite name is found, the corresponding *TranslatedSids* entry MUST be updated with:
- Use: SidTypeUnknown
- Sid: NULL
- Flags: 0x00000000 (also see the following paragraph)
- DomainIndex: Index of the domain in the *ReferencedDomains* parameter.
In all preceding cases, the **Flags** field MUST contain 0x00000002 when:

- *LookupLevel* is LsapLookupWksta, LsapLookupPDC, LsapLookupGC, LsapLookupXForestReferral, or LsapLookupXForestResolve, and
- The IsDomainNameInTrustedForest algorithm defined in [MS-DRSR](../MS-DRSR/MS-DRSR.md) section 5.64.2 (Determining If a Name Is in a Trusted Forest), given the domain name, returns true, or the IsUPNInTrustedForest algorithm defined in [MS-DRSR] section 5.109, given the full name to be translated, returns true.
The return value MUST be set to STATUS_SUCCESS if all names are translated correctly.

If some names are translated correctly but some are not, the return value MUST be set to STATUS_SOME_NOT_MAPPED.

If none of the names are translated correctly, the return value SHOULD<28> be set to STATUS_NONE_MAPPED.

If *LookupLevel* is LsapLookupWksta, and the return code can be identified as an error value (that is, less than 0) other than STATUS_NONE_MAPPED, *ReferencedDomains* and the **Sids** field in the *TranslatedSids* structure MUST NOT be returned.

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 STATUS_SUCCESS | The request was successfully completed. |
| 0x00000107 STATUS_SOME_NOT_MAPPED | Some of the information to be translated has not been translated. |

| 0xC000000D STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER | One of the supplied parameters was invalid. |
| 0xC0000073 STATUS_NONE_MAPPED | None of the information to be translated has been translated. |

This message is valid only if the RPC server is a domain controller. The RPC server MUST return STATUS_INVALID_SERVER_STATE in the return value if it is not a domain controller.

The RPC server MUST ensure that one of the following conditions is true:

- The RPC_C_AUTHN_NETLOGON security provider (as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.2.1.1.7) and at least RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_INTEGRITY authentication level (as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 2.2.1.1.8) are used in this RPC message.
- The RPC client token contains one of the following well-known SID types - DOMAIN_GROUP_RID_COMPUTERS, DOMAIN_GROUP_RID_CONTROLLERS, DOMAIN_GROUP_RID_READONLY_CONTROLLERS (as specified in [MS-SAMR](../MS-SAMR/MS-SAMR.md) section 2.2.1.14).<34>
Otherwise, the RPC server MUST return STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED.

The RPC server MUST check each element in the *SidEnumBuffer* parameter for validity, as specified in section [2.2.18](#Section_2.2.18), and individual elements in this structure MUST be checked for validity, as described for the SID structure in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.4.2. If validation fails, the RPC server SHOULD return STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.

The *TranslatedNames* and *MappedCount* parameters have no effect on message processing in any environment. They MUST be ignored on input.

The RPC server search scope can change depending on the *LookupLevel* parameter, as specified in section 2.2.16. In the views corresponding to each *LookupLevel*, SIDs MUST be searched under the Security Principal SID and Security Principal SID History columns.

Output parameters MUST be updated using the following information:

- When a SID is found in the database, the *ReferencedDomains* parameter MUST be searched for an identical entry with the **Name** field containing the value from the Domain NetBIOS Name column and the **Sid** field containing the value from the Domain SID column. If there is no such entry, a new entry with the **Name** field containing the value of the Domain NetBIOS Name and the **Sid** field containing the value of the Domain SID MUST be created and added to the *ReferencedDomains* list.
For the successful search, the corresponding *TranslatedNames* entry MUST be updated as follows:

- Use: Security Principal Type column
- Name: Security Principal Name column
- Flags:
- 0x00000001: If the search is not satisfied by matching against the Security Principal SID column. Also see the paragraph after step 3.
- 0x00000004: If the search is satisfied by matching in [Configurable Translation View (section 3.1.1.1.2)](#Section_3.1.1.1.2). Also see the paragraph after step 3.
- DomainIndex: Index of the domain in the *ReferencedDomains* parameter.
- If a match cannot be found for a SID, but the domain portion of the SID can be matched with a domain SID, the *ReferencedDomains* parameter MUST be searched for an identical entry with the **Name** field containing the value from the Domain NetBIOS Name column and the **Sid** field containing the value from the Domain SID column. If there is no such entry, a new entry with the **Name** field containing the value of the Domain NetBIOS Name and the **Sid** field containing the value of the Domain SID MUST be created and added to the *ReferencedDomains* list.
The corresponding *TranslatedNames* entry MUST be updated by using the following view:

- Use: SidTypeUnknown.
- Name: Empty unless *LookupLevel* is LsapLookupWksta, in which case this field must contain a textual representation of the last 32 bits of the corresponding SID in hexadecimal format.
- Flags: 0x00000000 (also see the paragraph after step 3).
- DomainIndex: Index of the domain in the *ReferencedDomains* parameter.
- Otherwise, the corresponding *TranslatedNames* entry MUST be updated with:
- Use: SidTypeUnknown.
- Name: Empty, unless *LookupLevel* is LsapLookupWksta. In that case, Name MUST contain the textual representation of the corresponding SID, as in step 2.
- Flags: 0x00000000 (also see the following paragraph).
- DomainIndex: -1.
In all preceding cases, the **Flags** field MUST contain 0x00000002 when:

- *LookupLevel* is LsapLookupWksta, LsapLookupPDC, LsapLookupGC, LsapLookupXForestReferral, or LsapLookupXForestResolve, and
- The IsDomainSidInTrustedForest algorithm defined in [MS-DRSR](../MS-DRSR/MS-DRSR.md) section 5.97 returns true.
The return value MUST be set to STATUS_SUCCESS if all SIDs are translated correctly.

If some SIDs are translated correctly but some are not, the return value MUST be set to STATUS_SOME_NOT_MAPPED.

If none of the SIDs are translated correctly, the return value MUST be set to STATUS_NONE_MAPPED.

If *LookupLevel* is LsapLookupWksta, and the return code can be identified as an error value other than STATUS_NONE_MAPPED, *ReferencedDomains* and the **Names** fields in the *TranslatedNames* structure MUST NOT be returned.

**ReferencedDomains:** On successful return, contains the domain information for the domain to which each security principal belongs. The domain information includes a NetBIOS domain name and a domain SID for each entry in the list.

**TranslatedNames:** On successful return, contains the corresponding name forms for security principal SIDs in the *SidEnumBuffer* parameter. It MUST be ignored on input.

**LookupLevel:** Specifies what scopes are to be used during translation, as specified in section [2.2.16](#Section_2.2.16).

**MappedCount:** On return, contains the number of names that are translated completely to their name forms. It MUST be ignored on input.

**LookupOptions:** Flags that control the lookup operation. This parameter is reserved for future use and SHOULD<35> be set to 0.

**ClientRevision:** Version of the client, which implies the client's capabilities. For possible values and their meanings, see section [3.1.4.5](#Section_3.1.4.5).

**Return Values:** The following table contains a summary of the return values that an implementation MUST return, as specified by the message processing shown after the table.

| Return value/code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 STATUS_SUCCESS | The request was successfully completed. |
| 0x00000107 STATUS_SOME_NOT_MAPPED | Some of the information to be translated has not been translated. |
| 0xC0000022 STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED | The caller does not have the permissions to perform this operation. |
| 0xC000000D STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER | One of the supplied parameters was invalid. |
| 0xC0000073 STATUS_NONE_MAPPED | None of the information to be translated has been translated. |

The behavior required when receiving an LsarLookupSids2 message MUST be identical to that when receiving an [LsarLookupSids3](#Section_3.1.4.9) message, with the following exceptions:

- This message is valid on non–[**domain controller**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) machines as well as domain controllers.
- *LookupLevel* values other than LsapLookupWksta are not valid if the [**RPC server**](#gt_rpc-server) is not a domain controller. For this condition, the RPC server MUST return an error in the return value.
- The server MUST return STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED if neither of the following conditions are true:
- The RPC_C_AUTHN_NETLOGON security provider (as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.2.1.1.7) and at least RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_INTEGRITY authentication level (as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 2.2.1.1.8) were used in this [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) message.
- The PolicyHandle was granted POLICY_LOOKUP_NAMES access.

### 3.1.5 Timer Events

No protocol timer events are required on the [**RPC server**](#gt_rpc-server) other than the timers required in the underlying [**RPC transport**](#gt_rpc-transport).

<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>
### 3.1.6 Other Local Events

No additional local events are used on the [**RPC server**](#gt_rpc-server) other than the events maintained in the underlying [**RPC transport**](#gt_rpc-transport).

<a id="Section_3.2"></a>
## 3.2 Client Details

The client side of this protocol is simply a pass-through between the transport and the higher-layer protocol or application. There are no additional timers or other state required on the client side. Calls made by a higher-layer protocol or application are passed directly to the transport, and the results returned by the transport are passed directly back to the higher-layer protocol or application.

There are several versions of messages that provide similar functionality. Higher-level protocols or applications can use the following guidelines when deciding what message to send.<36>

For selecting between [LsarLookupNames4](#Section_3.1.4.5), [LsarLookupNames3](#Section_3.1.4.6), [LsarLookupNames2](#Section_3.1.4.7), and [LsarLookupNames](#Section_3.1.4.8):

- Only a [**domain controller**](#gt_domain-controller-dc) can process an LsarLookupNames4 message.
- LsarLookupNames4 requires an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) handle (specified in its *RpcHandle* parameter) and that the connection is authenticated using the RPC_C_AUTHN_NETLOGON security provider, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.2.1.1.7.
- If these requirements are available to the caller, LsarLookupNames4 can be used; otherwise, LsarLookupNames3 is preferred.
- Domain controllers and non–domain controllers can process LsarLookupNames3, LsarLookupNames2, and LsarLookupNames messages.
For specifics on each message, see sections 3.1.4.5, 3.1.4.6, 3.1.4.7, and 3.1.4.8.

For selecting between [LsarLookupSids3](#Section_3.1.4.9), [LsarLookupSids2](#Section_3.1.4.10), and [LsarLookupSids](#Section_3.1.4.9):

- Only a domain controller can process an LsarLookupSids3 message.
- LsarLookupSids3 requires an RPC handle (specified in its RpcHandle parameter) and that the connection is authenticated using the RPC_C_AUTHN_NETLOGON security provider, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 2.2.1.1.7.
- If these requirements are available to the caller, LsarLookupSids3 can be used; otherwise, LsarLookupSids2 is preferred.
- Domain controllers and non–domain controllers can process LsarLookupSids2 and LsarLookupSids messages.
For specifics on each message, see sections 3.1.4.9, 3.1.4.10, and 3.1.4.11.

<a id="Section_4"></a>
# 4 Protocol Example

In this scenario, the client wants to translate a group of [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) to their corresponding names. The client starts the communication by sending an [LsarOpenPolicy2](#Section_3.1.4.1) request with the following parameters:

NTSTATUS

LsarOpenPolicy2(

[in,unique,string] wchar_t* SystemName = "arbitrary string",

[in] PLSAPR_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES ObjectAttributes,

[in] ACCESS_MASK DesiredAccess = 0x00000800,

[out] LSAPR_HANDLE *PolicyHandle

);

where *ObjectAttributes* is:

typedef struct _LSAPR_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES {

unsigned long Length = 0;

unsigned char *RootDirectory = NULL;

PSTRING ObjectName = NULL;

unsigned long Attributes = 0;

PLSAPR_SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR SecurityDescriptor = NULL;

PSECURITY_QUALITY_OF_SERVICE SecurityQualityOfService = NULL;

} LSAPR_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES, *PLSAPR_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES;

The server receives this request and performs an access check for the desired access. When successful, the server returns a context handle for the client's use and STATUS_SUCCESS as the return value. That is:

NTSTATUS = 0x00000000

LsarOpenPolicy2(

[in,unique,string] wchar_t* SystemName = {unchanged}

[in] PLSAPR_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES ObjectAttributes = {unchanged},

[in] ACCESS_MASK DesiredAccess = {unchanged},

[out] LSAPR_HANDLE *PolicyHandle = {context handle}

);

The client receives this response and sends an [LsarLookupSids2](#Section_3.1.4.10) request to translate the batch of SIDs to names with the following parameters:

NTSTATUS

LsarLookupSids2(

[in] LSAPR_HANDLE PolicyHandle =

{handle returned by LsarOpenPolicy2},

[in] PLSAPR_SID_ENUM_BUFFER SidEnumBuffer,

[out] PLSAPR_REFERENCED_DOMAIN_LIST *ReferencedDomains,

[in, out] PLSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAMES_EX TranslatedNames =

{address of a local variable initialized

with zeroes},

[in] LSAP_LOOKUP_LEVEL LookupLevel = LsapLookupWksta,

[in, out] unsigned long *MappedCount =

{address of a local variable initialized to 0},

[in] unsigned long LookupOptions = 0,

[in] unsigned long ClientRevision = 2

);

where *SidEnumBuffer* is:

typedef struct _LSAPR_SID_ENUM_BUFFER {

unsigned long Entries = {3};

[size_is(Entries)] PLSAPR_SID_INFORMATION SidInfo;

} LSAPR_SID_ENUM_BUFFER, *PLSAPR_SID_ENUM_BUFFER;

and SidInfo array is:

SidInfo[0] =

typedef struct _LSAPR_SID_INFORMATION {

PRPC_SID Sid = { SID0 };

} LSAPR_SID_INFORMATION, *PLSAPR_SID_INFORMATION;

SidInfo[1] =

typedef struct _LSAPR_SID_INFORMATION {

PRPC_SID Sid = { SID1 };

} LSAPR_SID_INFORMATION, *PLSAPR_SID_INFORMATION;

SidInfo[2] =

typedef struct _LSAPR_SID_INFORMATION {

PRPC_SID Sid = { SID2 };

} LSAPR_SID_INFORMATION, *PLSAPR_SID_INFORMATION;

The server receives this call and performs the translation explained in message processing in section 3.1.4.10. The server prepares the results, and returns them to the caller with a return value of STATUS_SUCCESS. The results might resemble the following:

NTSTATUS = 0x00000000

LsarLookupSids2(

[in] LSAPR_HANDLE PolicyHandle = {unchanged},

[in] PLSAPR_SID_ENUM_BUFFER SidEnumBuffer = {unchanged},

[out] PLSAPR_REFERENCED_DOMAIN_LIST *ReferencedDomains,

[in, out] PLSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAMES_EX TranslatedNames,

[in] LSAP_LOOKUP_LEVEL LookupLevel = {unchanged},

[in, out] unsigned long *MappedCount = { 3 },

[in] unsigned long LookupOptions = {unchanged},

[in] unsigned long ClientRevision = {unchanged}

);

where *ReferencedDomains* is:

typedef struct _LSAPR_REFERENCED_DOMAIN_LIST {

unsigned long Entries = { 2 };

[size_is(Entries)] PLSAPR_TRUST_INFORMATION Domains;

unsigned long MaxEntries = { 0 };

} LSAPR_REFERENCED_DOMAIN_LIST, *PLSAPR_REFERENCED_DOMAIN_LIST;

and Domains array is:

Domains[0] =

typedef struct _LSAPR_TRUST_INFORMATION {

RPC_UNICODE_STRING Name = { "Domain0" };

PRPC_SID Sid = { DomainSID0 };

} LSAPR_TRUST_INFORMATION, *PLSAPR_TRUST_INFORMATION;

Domains[1] =

typedef struct _LSAPR_TRUST_INFORMATION {

RPC_UNICODE_STRING Name = { "Domain1" };

PRPC_SID Sid = { DomainSID1 };

} LSAPR_TRUST_INFORMATION, *PLSAPR_TRUST_INFORMATION;

*TranslatedNames* might appear as follows:

typedef struct _LSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAMES_EX {

unsigned long Entries = { 3 };

[size_is(Entries)] PLSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAME_EX Names;

} LSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAMES_EX, *PLSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAMES_EX;

where Names array is:

Names[0] =

typedef struct _LSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAME_EX {

SID_NAME_USE Use = { SidTypeUser };

RPC_UNICODE_STRING Name = { "Name0" };

long DomainIndex = { 0 };

unsigned long Flags = { 0 };

} LSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAME_EX, *PLSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAME_EX;

Names[1] =

typedef struct _LSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAME_EX {

SID_NAME_USE Use = { SidTypeDomain };

RPC_UNICODE_STRING Name = { "DomainName0" };

long DomainIndex = { 0 };

unsigned long Flags = { 0 };

} LSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAME_EX, *PLSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAME_EX;

Names[2] =

typedef struct _LSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAME_EX {

SID_NAME_USE Use = { SidTypeUser };

RPC_UNICODE_STRING Name = { "Name3" };

long DomainIndex = { 1 };

unsigned long Flags = { 0 };

} LSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAME_EX, *PLSAPR_TRANSLATED_NAME_EX;

The client receives this response, and extracts the names from the returned information. It then sends an [LsarClose](#Section_3.1.4.3) request to release the context handle that was opened in the first call:

NTSTATUS

LsarClose(

[in,out] LSAPR_HANDLE *ObjectHandle

= {handle returned by LsarOpenPolicy2}

);

The server receives this call, and releases the handle. It responds to the caller with a return value of STATUS_SUCCESS:

NTSTATUS = 0x00000000

LsarClose(

[in,out] LSAPR_HANDLE *ObjectHandle = {0}

);

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

This protocol provides query functionality into databases that might have other access control mechanisms. This protocol should obey those mechanisms; otherwise, it might become a source of information disclosure.

Access control on an [**RPC server**](#gt_rpc-server) of this protocol should be configurable to allow customizations.<37>

The RPC server has to successfully authenticate the client if user names are considered confidential information.

The [**RPC client**](#gt_rpc-client) has to authenticate the server if the results are used to make policy decisions.

# 7 Appendix B: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

The terms "earlier" and "later", when used with a product version, refer to either all preceding versions or all subsequent versions, respectively. The term "through" refers to the inclusive range of versions. Applicable Microsoft products are listed chronologically in this section.

The following tables show the relationships between Microsoft product versions or supplemental software and the roles they perform.

| Windows Client releases | Client role | Server role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows NT operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows 2000 Professional operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows XP operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows Vista operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows 7 operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows 8 operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows 8.1 operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows 10 operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows 11 operating system | Yes | Yes |

| Windows Server releases | Client role | Server role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows NT | Yes | Yes |
| Windows 2000 Server operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows Server 2003 operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows Server 2003 R2 operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows Server 2008 operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows Server 2012 operating system | Yes | Yes |

| Windows Server operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows Server 2019 operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows Server 2022 operating system | Yes | Yes |
| Windows Server 2025 operating system | Yes | Yes |

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 2.1: The Windows [**RPC server**](#gt_rpc-server) and [**RPC client**](#gt_rpc-client) do not support TCP/IP on Windows NT and Windows 2000 operating system.

<2> Section 2.1: The endpoint "\PIPE\lsarpc" by default allows anonymous access on Windows NT 3.1 operating system, Windows NT 3.5 operating system, Windows NT 3.51 operating system, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, and Windows Vista. Anonymous access to this pipe is removed by default on Windows Vista operating system with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later and Windows Server 2008 and later. Pipe access check happens before any other access check, and hence overrides any other access.

<3> Section 2.1: If the client uses an unsupported [**RPC protocol sequence**](#gt_rpc-protocol-sequence), the RPC server implementations in Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2003 R2 return RPC_S_PROTSEQ_NOT_SUPPORTED (as specified in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md)). Windows Vista and later and Windows Server 2008 and later throw an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) exception with status code ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.

<4> Section 2.1: Servers running Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 accept calls at any authentication level. Without [[MSKB-3149090]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=786963) installed, servers running Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10 v1507 operating system, or Windows 10 v1511 operating system also accept calls at any authentication level.

- Via the strict_context_handle attribute, reject the use of context handles created by a method of a different RPC interface than this one (as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 3).
<22> Section 3.1.4: The following table contains a timeline of when each method was introduced.

| Opnum | Friendly name | Product |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | LsarClose | Windows NT 3.1 |
| 6 | LsarOpenPolicy | Windows NT 3.1 |
| 14 | LsarLookupNames | Windows NT 3.1 |

<23> Section 3.1.4: Some gaps in the [**opnum**](#gt_opnum) numbering sequence correspond to opnums that are documented in [MS-LSAD](../MS-LSAD/MS-LSAD.md). All other gaps in the opnum numbering sequence apply to Windows as follows.

| Opnum | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 5 | Not used by Windows. |
| 9 | Not used by Windows. |
| 21 | Not used by Windows. |
| 22 | Not used by Windows. |
| 52 | Not used by Windows. |
| 56 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 60 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 61 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 62 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 63 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 64 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 65 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 66 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 67 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 69 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 70 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 71 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 72 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |
| 75 | Used only locally by Windows, never remotely. |

<24> Section 3.1.4.5: The Windows RPC server and RPC client limit the **Count** field of this structure to 1,000 (using the range primitive defined in [MS-RPCE]) in Windows XP SP2 and later and Windows Server 2003 and later. Windows NT 3.1, Windows NT 3.5, Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows XP do not enforce this restriction.

<25> Section 3.1.4.5: For Windows, usage of 0x00000001 for ClientRevision implies a client that is running an operating system released before Windows 2000 (Windows NT 3.1, Windows NT 3.5, Windows NT 3.51, and Windows NT 4.0). Usage of 0x00000002 implies that the client is running an operating system version of Windows 2000 and later.

<26> Section 3.1.4.5: Applies to Windows 11, version 24H2 operating system and later, and to Windows Server 2025 and later.

<27> Section 3.1.4.5: Windows 2000 Server, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2003 R2 do not match names in [**user principal name**](#gt_user-principal-name-upn) form if ALL of the following are true:

- *LookupLevel* is either LsapLookupWksta or LsapLookupPDC.
- The server is a [**domain controller**](#gt_domain-controller-dc).
- *ClientRevision* is 0x00000001.
- The server is in a mixed [**domain**](#gt_domain) environment.
<28> Section 3.1.4.5: On a domain-joined, non-DC machine, when 0x80000000 is passed for the *LookupOptions* argument with a mix of isolated and composite names that cannot be matched in the views that are to be searched, Windows XP and later and Windows Server 2003 and later return STATUS_SOME_NOT_MAPPED.

<29> Section 3.1.4.6: All versions of Windows that implement this method ([LsarLookupNames3](#Section_3.1.4.6)) also implement [LsarLookupNames4](#Section_3.1.4.5) (both in terms of client and server); hence, this method does not need to be implemented to interoperate with Windows clients or servers. The choice of which method to call depends on whether the client has a [**local security authority (LSA)**](#gt_local-security-authority-lsa) policy handle or an RPC binding handle. Complete compatibility with Windows supports both calls.

<30> Section 3.1.4.6: The Windows implementation of the RPC server and RPC client limits the **Count** field of this structure to 1,000 (using the range primitive defined in [MS-RPCE]) in Windows XP SP2 and later and Windows Server 2003 and later. Windows NT 3.1, Windows NT 3.5, Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows XP do not enforce this restriction.

<31> Section 3.1.4.7: A Windows RPC server can optionally be configured to deny this call, and the error returned in this case is STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED.

<32> Section 3.1.4.7: The Windows RPC server and RPC client limit the **Count** field of this structure to 1,000 (using the range primitive defined in [MS-RPCE]) in Windows XP SP2 and later and Windows Server 2003 and later. Windows NT 3.1, Windows NT 3.5, Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows XP do not enforce this restriction.

<33> Section 3.1.4.8: The Windows RPC server and RPC client limit the **Count** field of this structure to 1,000 (using the range primitive defined in [MS-RPCE]) in Windows XP SP2 and later and Windows Server 2003 and later. Windows NT 3.1, Windows NT 3.5, Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows XP do not enforce this restriction.

<34> Section 3.1.4.9: Applies to Windows 11, version 24H2 and later, and to Windows Server 2025 and later.

<35> Section 3.1.4.10: The Windows RPC client sets LookupOptions to 0.

<36> Section 3.2: Windows clients negotiate the highest revision supported by the server by first calling the highest revision supported for that client. If the RPC exception that indicates that the function is out of range is returned from the server (exception number 0x6d1), the client proceeds to call the next lower revision. This process is repeated until the oldest possible revision supported by the client is invoked or until the server responds to the request.

<37> Section 5.1: The Windows RPC server for this protocol is customizable to allow anonymous callers to make requests for compatibility with Windows NT 3.1, Windows NT 3.5, Windows NT 3.51, and Windows NT 4.0 machines.
