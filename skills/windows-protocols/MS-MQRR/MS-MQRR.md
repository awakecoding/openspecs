# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Message Queuing (MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read Protocol, a [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc)-based protocol that is used by [**Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)**](#gt_microsoft-message-queuing-msmq) clients to read or reject a [**message**](#gt_message) from a [**queue**](#gt_queue), to move a message between queues, and to purge all messages from a queue.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_authentication-level"></a>
**authentication level**: A numeric value indicating the level of authentication or message protection that [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) will apply to a specific message exchange. For more information, see [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) section 13.1.2.1 and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md).

<a id="gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc"></a>
**Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**: A high-precision atomic time standard that approximately tracks Universal Time (UT). It is the basis for legal, civil time all over the Earth. Time zones around the world are expressed as positive and negative offsets from UTC. In this role, it is also referred to as Zulu time (Z) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). In these specifications, all references to UTC refer to the time at UTC-0 (or GMT).

<a id="gt_cursor"></a>
**cursor**: A data structure providing sequential access over a message queue. A cursor has a current pointer that lies between the head and tail pointer of the [**queue**](#gt_queue). The pointer can be moved forward or backward through an operation on the cursor (Next). A [**message**](#gt_message) at the current pointer can be accessed through a nondestructive read (Peek) operation or a destructive read (Receive) operation.

<a id="gt_dead-letter-queue"></a>
**dead-letter queue**: A [**queue**](#gt_queue) that contains [**messages**](#gt_message) that were sent from a host with a request for negative source journaling and that could not be delivered. [**Message Queuing**](#gt_microsoft-message-queuing-msmq) provides a transactional dead-letter queue and a non-transactional dead-letter queue.

<a id="gt_direct-format-name"></a>
**direct format name**: A name that is used to reference a public queue or a private queue without accessing the MSMQ Directory Service. Message Queuing can use the physical, explicit location information provided by direct format names to send [**messages**](#gt_message) directly to their destinations. For more information, see [MS-MQMQ] section 2.1.

<a id="gt_directory"></a>
**directory**: The database that stores information about objects such as users, groups, computers, printers, and the directory service that makes this information available to users and applications.

<a id="gt_dynamic-endpoint"></a>
**dynamic endpoint**: A network-specific server address that is requested and assigned at run time. For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_endpoint"></a>
**endpoint**: A network-specific address of a remote procedure call (RPC) server process for remote procedure calls. The actual name and type of the endpoint depends on the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol sequence that is being used. For example, for RPC over TCP (RPC Protocol Sequence ncacn_ip_tcp), an endpoint might be TCP port 1025. For RPC over Server Message Block (RPC Protocol Sequence ncacn_np), an endpoint might be the name of a named pipe. For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with [**universally unique identifier (UUID)**](#gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [C706] have to be used for generating the GUID. See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_interface-definition-language-idl"></a>
**Interface Definition Language (IDL)**: The International Standards Organization (ISO) standard language for specifying the interface for remote procedure calls. For more information, see [C706] section 4.

<a id="gt_kerberos"></a>
**Kerberos**: An authentication system that enables two parties to exchange private information across an otherwise open network by assigning a unique key (called a ticket) to each user that logs on to the network and then embedding these tickets into messages sent by the users. For more information, see [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md).

<a id="gt_message"></a>
**message**: A data structure representing a unit of data transfer between distributed applications. A message has [**message properties**](#gt_message-property), which can include message header properties, a [**message body**](#gt_message-body) property, and message trailer properties.

<a id="gt_message-body"></a>
**message body**: A distinguished [**message property**](#gt_message-property) that represents the application payload.

<a id="gt_message-header"></a>
**message header**: See [**message packet header**](#gt_message-packet-header).

<a id="gt_message-packet"></a>
**message packet**: A byte buffer that is the physical representation of the [**message**](#gt_message) in the [**queue manager**](#gt_queue-manager-qm) and on the wire.

<a id="gt_message-packet-header"></a>
**message packet header**: The set of [**message properties**](#gt_message-property) in a [**message packet**](#gt_message-packet) that precedes the [**message body**](#gt_message-body) property. Also called a [**message header**](#gt_message-header).

<a id="gt_message-packet-trailer"></a>
**message packet trailer**: The set of [**message properties**](#gt_message-property) in a [**message packet**](#gt_message-packet) that follows the [**message body**](#gt_message-body) property. Also called a [**message trailer**](#gt_message-trailer).

<a id="gt_message-property"></a>
**message property**: A data structure that contains a property identifier and a value, and that is associated with a [**message**](#gt_message).

<a id="gt_message-queuing"></a>
**message queuing**: A communications service that provides asynchronous and reliable message passing between distributed client applications. In message queuing, clients send messages to message queues and consume messages from message queues. The message queues provide persistence of the messages, which enables the sending and receiving client applications to operate asynchronously from each other.

<a id="gt_message-trailer"></a>
**message trailer**: See [**message packet trailer**](#gt_message-packet-trailer).

<a id="gt_microsoft-message-queuing-msmq"></a>
**Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)**: A communications service that provides asynchronous and reliable [**message**](#gt_message) passing between distributed applications. In Message Queuing, applications send [**messages**](#gt_message) to [**queues**](#gt_queue) and consume [**messages**](#gt_message) from [**queues**](#gt_queue). The [**queues**](#gt_queue) provide persistence of the [**messages**](#gt_message), enabling the sending and receiving applications to operate asynchronously from one another.

<a id="gt_msmq-routing-server"></a>
**MSMQ routing server**: A role played by an MSMQ queue manager. An MSMQ routing server implements store and forward messaging. A routing server can provide connectivity between different connected networks within a site or can provide session concentration between sites.

<a id="gt_network-data-representation-ndr"></a>
**Network Data Representation (NDR)**: A specification that defines a mapping from [**Interface Definition Language (IDL)**](#gt_interface-definition-language-idl) data types onto octet streams. [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr) also refers to the runtime environment that implements the mapping facilities (for example, data provided to [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr)). For more information, see [MS-RPCE] and [C706] section 14.

<a id="gt_nt-lan-manager-ntlm-authentication-protocol"></a>
**NT LAN Manager (NTLM) Authentication Protocol**: A protocol using a challenge-response mechanism for authentication in which clients are able to verify their identities without sending a password to the server. It consists of three messages, commonly referred to as Type 1 (negotiation), Type 2 (challenge) and Type 3 (authentication).

<a id="gt_queue"></a>
**queue**: An object that holds [**messages**](#gt_message) passed between applications or [**messages**](#gt_message) passed between [**Message Queuing**](#gt_microsoft-message-queuing-msmq) and applications. In general, applications can send [**messages**](#gt_message) to queues and read [**messages**](#gt_message) from queues.

<a id="gt_queue-manager-qm"></a>
**queue manager (QM)**: A message queuing service that manages [**queues**](#gt_queue) deployed on a computer. A queue manager can also provide asynchronous transfer of [**messages**](#gt_message) to [**queues**](#gt_queue) deployed on other queue managers.

<a id="gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc"></a>
**remote procedure call (RPC)**: A communication protocol used primarily between client and server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message). For more information, see [C706].

<a id="gt_remote-queue"></a>
**remote queue**: For a [**queue manager**](#gt_queue-manager-qm), a [**queue**](#gt_queue) that is hosted by a remote [**queue manager**](#gt_queue-manager-qm). For an application, a [**queue**](#gt_queue) hosted by a [**queue manager**](#gt_queue-manager-qm) other than the one with which the application communicates.

<a id="gt_rpc-protocol-sequence"></a>
**RPC protocol sequence**: A character string that represents a valid combination of a [**remote procedure call (RPC)**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol, a network layer protocol, and a transport layer protocol, as described in [C706] and [MS-RPCE].

<a id="gt_subqueue"></a>
**subqueue**: A message queue that is logically associated, through a naming hierarchy, with a parent message queue. Subqueues can be used to partition [**messages**](#gt_message) within the [**queue**](#gt_queue). For example, a queue journal can be a subqueue that holds a copy of each [**message**](#gt_message) consumed from its parent [**queue**](#gt_queue).

<a id="gt_transactional-queue"></a>
**transactional queue**: A [**queue**](#gt_queue) that contains only transactional messages.

<a id="gt_unicode"></a>
**Unicode**: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world. The [**Unicode**](#gt_unicode) standard [[UNICODE5.0.0/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154659) provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16 BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

<a id="gt_universally-unique-identifier-uuid"></a>
**universally unique identifier (UUID)**: A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also known as [**globally unique identifiers (GUIDs)**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) and these terms are used interchangeably in the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [RFC4122] or [C706] has to be used for generating the UUID.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

[**Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)**](#gt_microsoft-message-queuing-msmq) is a communications service that provides asynchronous and reliable [**message**](#gt_message) passing between client applications running on different hosts. In MSMQ, clients send application messages to a [**queue**](#gt_queue) and/or consume application messages from a queue. The queue provides persistence of the messages, enabling them to survive across application restarts and allowing the sending and receiving client applications to send and receive messages asynchronously from each other.

Queues are typically hosted by a communications service called a [**queue manager**](#gt_queue-manager-qm). By hosting the queue manager in a separate service from the client applications, applications can communicate even if they never execute at the same time by exchanging messages via a queue hosted by the queue manager.

The queue manager can execute on a different node than the client applications. When this scenario occurs, a protocol is required to insert messages into the queue, and another protocol is needed to consume messages from the queue. The Message Queuing (MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read Protocol provides a protocol for consuming messages from a [**remote queue**](#gt_remote-queue).

<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 Messages

Each [**message**](#gt_message) exchanged in an [**MSMQ**](#gt_microsoft-message-queuing-msmq) system typically has a set of [**message properties**](#gt_message-property) that contain metadata about the message and a distinguished property called a [**message body**](#gt_message-body) that contains the application payload. Message properties that are serialized in front of the message body are referred to as message headers, and message properties serialized after the message body property are referred to as message trailers.

Messages carried by this protocol are treated as payload. The format and structure of the application messages are generally opaque to the protocol. However, the protocol assumes that such messages map to the abstractions of message header, message body, and message trailer. This mapping enables a consumer to request that a subset of the message body be returned while allowing all the message headers and message trailers to be returned. For more details, see the SectionBuffer (section [2.2.6](#Section_2.2.6)) structure.

The protocol also assumes that each message has a lookup identifier that is unique within the [**queue**](#gt_queue). This identifier is not part of the message but is instead assigned by the server.

<a id="Section_1.3.2"></a>
### 1.3.2 Queues

A [**queue**](#gt_queue) is a logical data structure that contains an ordered list of zero or more [**messages**](#gt_message). Queues, like files, have names. This protocol uses the [QUEUE_FORMAT (section 2.2.3)](#Section_2.2.3) structure to identify queues.

This protocol provides a mechanism to open a queue. Opening provides an opportunity to check for the existence of the queue and to perform authorization checks. The protocol provides for the return of an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) context handle that is used by the client to specify the queue to operate on in subsequent requests. The use of an RPC context handle provides a mechanism to ensure that server state is cleaned up if the connection between the client and server is lost.

When opening a queue, the client can specify an access mode that determines the operations (Peek, Receive, Move, Reject, and Purge) for which the returned handle can subsequently be used. The client can specify a sharing mode that either allows other clients to concurrently access the queue or ensures that the client has exclusive access to the queue. The latter can be used to avoid race conditions caused by other clients operating on the queue at the same time.

<a id="Section_1.3.3"></a>
### 1.3.3 Queue Operations

The protocol provides mechanisms for the following operations against an open [**queue**](#gt_queue).

A [**message**](#gt_message) can be consumed from an open queue through a destructive read operation referred to as a **Receive** operation, which atomically reads the message and removes it from the queue. Because this operation removes a message from a queue, a loss of network connection during this operation could result in permanent loss of the message. To guard against this situation, the protocol provides a mechanism for the client to positively or negatively acknowledge receipt of the message. Upon receipt of positive acknowledgment from the client, the server can remove the message from the queue. While the server is awaiting acknowledgment from the client, access to the message by other clients is prevented.

A message can be read from an open queue through a nondestructive read operation referred to as a **Peek** operation, which reads the message but does not remove it from the queue.

For both **Receive** and **Peek** operations, the client can limit the amount of the [**message body**](#gt_message-body) payload returned. This functionality enables efficient use of network resources when the client requires only a portion of the message body or when the client needs just the [**message properties**](#gt_message-property).

All the messages can be removed from a queue through a **Purge** mechanism. The messages removed through this mechanism are not returned to the client.

A message can be moved from one queue to another queue hosted at the same server through an atomic **Move** mechanism.

A client can inform the server that it has no need for a message via a **Reject** operation. The server can use this indication to inform the sender that the client did not consume the message. How a server does this task is not addressed in this specification.

<a id="Section_1.3.4"></a>
### 1.3.4 Access Patterns

[**Messages**](#gt_message) in a [**queue**](#gt_queue) can be consumed in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) access pattern. Because messages in a queue are ordered, there is a head that represents the front of the queue and a tail that represents the end of the queue.

The protocol provides mechanisms to **Peek** or **Receive** the first message in the queue.

The protocol also allows the client to specify exactly which message to **Peek** or **Receive**, regardless of its position in the queue, through a unique lookup identifier assigned to each message by the server. A message can also be specified relative to the message identified by the lookup identifier: for example, the message immediately preceding or following the message identified by the lookup identifier.

Finally, the protocol provides a mechanism, referred to as a [**cursor**](#gt_cursor), for sequential forward access through the queue. A cursor logically represents a current pointer that lies between the head and tail of the queue. A cursor can be specified to the **Peek** or **Receive** operation, which **Peeks** or **Receives** the message at the current pointer represented by the cursor. The cursor current pointer can be moved forward through a modified **Peek** operation called **PeekNext**. A **Receive** operation intrinsically moves the cursor forward.

Because cursors are stateful, the protocol provides mechanisms to create a cursor, to return a cursor handle to the client, and to close a cursor. Because a cursor represents a position within a queue, the protocol logically relates the cursor to the context handle associated with an open queue. The protocol places no limit on the number of concurrent cursors associated with a queue context handle.

<a id="Section_1.3.5"></a>
### 1.3.5 Transactions

The protocol allows the [**queue**](#gt_queue) operations **Receive** or **Move** to be performed within the context of a distributed atomic transaction, as specified in [MS-DTCO](../MS-DTCO/MS-DTCO.md). When this is done, the state changes that are related to the queue associated with the operation are performed provisionally, awaiting asynchronous notification of the outcome of the transaction. If the transaction outcome is **Commit**, the state changes become permanent. If the transaction outcome is **Abort**, the state changes are rolled back.

The protocol does not require that all queues support this atomic transaction behavior. A queue that supports transactional **Receive** is also required to support nontransactional **Receive**. The protocol returns an error if a transacted operation is attempted against a non-transactional queue. The protocol does not provide any other mechanism for determining whether a queue supports transactional behavior.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol is dependent upon [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) for its transport, as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).

The protocol functionality is a superset of the functionality as specified in [MS-MQQP](../MS-MQQP/MS-MQQP.md). Implementers are advised to choose this protocol over [MS-MQQP] except where compatibility necessitates using it.<1>

This protocol carries **Propagation Token**s ([MS-DTCO](../MS-DTCO/MS-DTCO.md) section 2.2.5.4) to orchestrate transactional scenarios.

This protocol is capable of carrying the layout and internal structure of the [**message**](#gt_message) in the [**queue**](#gt_queue), as specified in [MS-MQQP].

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Message Queuing (MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read Protocol is an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) interface and, as a result, has prerequisites, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md), that are common to RPC interfaces.

It is assumed that the protocol client has obtained the name of a remote computer that supports this protocol before this protocol is invoked.

This protocol uses authentication through RPC. The client has previously acquired valid credentials recognized by the server. The server has to be started and fully initialized before the protocol can start.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol provides functionality related to consumption of [**messages**](#gt_message) from a [**queue**](#gt_queue) hosted at a [**queue manager**](#gt_queue-manager-qm) running on a remote computer. It does not provide functionality related to inserting messages into a queue.

The server side of this protocol is applicable for implementation by a queue manager that provides [**message queuing**](#gt_message-queuing) communication services to clients. The client side of this protocol is applicable for implementation by client libraries that provide message queuing services to applications or by a client queue manager that delegates requests on behalf of a client application.

This protocol could be used to reliably transfer messages from a queue hosted at one queue manager (the server) to a queue hosted at another queue manager (the client). However, there are other protocols that are more suited to providing such reliable message transfer between queues. The Message Queuing (MSMQ): Binary Reliable Messaging protocol described in [MS-MQBR](../MS-MQBR/MS-MQBR.md) is one such protocol that provides message transfer functionality more efficiently and in a manner that provides end-to-end reliability through intermediate store-and-forward hops.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

Supported transports: This protocol uses the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over TCP/IP protocol sequence. However, it supports a mechanism for explicitly negotiating the RPC [**endpoint**](#gt_endpoint) to be used. Details are specified in section [3.1.4.1](#Section_3.1.4.1).

Protocol versions: This protocol uses a single version of the RPC interface, but that interface has been extended by adding the following additional methods at the end:

- R_MoveMessage (Opnum 10) (section [3.1.4.10)](#Section_3.1.4.10)
- R_OpenQueueForMove (Opnum 11) (section [3.1.4.11)](#Section_3.1.4.11)
- R_QMEnlistRemoteTransaction (Opnum 12) (section [3.1.4.12)](#Section_3.1.4.12)
- R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section [3.1.4.13)](#Section_3.1.4.13)
- R_SetUserAcknowledgementClass (Opnum 14) (section [3.1.4.14)](#Section_3.1.4.14)
- R_EndTransactionalReceive (Opnum 15) (section [3.1.4.15)](#Section_3.1.4.15)
Capability Negotiation: This protocol is used for receiving messages from a remote [**queue manager**](#gt_queue-manager-qm).<2> The queue manager can implement a capability negotiation mechanism as specified in the processing rules for [Opening a Queue (section 3.2.4.1)](#Section_3.2.4.1) to determine whether this protocol is supported by the remote queue manager.

Security and authentication methods: This protocol supports the [**NT LAN Manager (NTLM) Authentication Protocol**](#gt_nt-lan-manager-ntlm-authentication-protocol) and [**Kerberos**](#gt_kerberos) authentication methods.<3>

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol uses [HRESULT](#Section_2.2.1) values as defined in [MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.1. Vendors can define their own HRESULT values provided that they set the C bit (0x20000000) for each vendor-defined value, indicating that the value is a customer code.

## 2.1 Transport

This protocol MUST use the following [**RPC protocol sequence**](#gt_rpc-protocol-sequence): [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) over TCP/IP (ncacn_ip_tcp), as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md). This protocol uses RPC [**dynamic endpoints**](#gt_dynamic-endpoint) as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) section 4. This protocol MAY<4> use an RPC static [**endpoint**](#gt_endpoint) as specified in [C706] section 4.

This protocol allows any user to establish a connection to the RPC server. For each connection, the server uses the underlying RPC protocol to retrieve the identity of the invoking client, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 3.3.3.4.3. The server SHOULD use this identity to perform method-specific access checks.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Common Data Types

This protocol references commonly used data types as defined in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md).

This protocol MUST indicate to the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) runtime that it is to support both the [**Network Data Representation (NDR)**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr) and NDR64 transfer syntaxes and MUST provide a negotiation mechanism for determining which transfer syntax will be used, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) (section 3).

In addition to the RPC base types and definitions, as specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) and [MS-RPCE], this specification supports the following data types:

- [HRESULT](#Section_2.2.1)
- [GUID](#Section_2.2.2)
- **QUEUE_FORMAT** ([MS-MQMQ](../MS-MQMQ/MS-MQMQ.md) section 2.2.7)

This specification uses the **HRESULT** ([MS-ERREF](../MS-ERREF/MS-ERREF.md) section 2.1) type.

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 GUID

This specification uses a [**globally unique identifier (GUID)**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). Unless otherwise qualified, instances of **GUID** in sections [2](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) and [3](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) refer to [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.3.4.

<a id="Section_2.2.3"></a>
### 2.2.3 QUEUE_FORMAT

This structure is used to identify a [**queue**](#gt_queue). This structure is common to many [**Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)**](#gt_microsoft-message-queuing-msmq) protocols. For more details, see [MS-MQMQ](../MS-MQMQ/MS-MQMQ.md) section 2.2.7. Only a subset of the **QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE** ([MS-MQMQ] section 2.2.6) enumeration is supported by this protocol. This subset is:

- QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_UNKNOWN
- QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_PUBLIC
- QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_PRIVATE
- QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_DIRECT
- QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_MACHINE
- QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_SUBQUEUE
In addition, this protocol supports only a subset of the Protocol Address Specifications defined for QUEUE_FORMAT in [MS-MQMQ] section 2.1.2 when the **m_qft** member of this structure is set to QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_DIRECT. This subset is:

- TCP
- OS
<a id="Section_2.2.4"></a>
### 2.2.4 Queue Context Handles

A [**queue**](#gt_queue) context handle is an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) context handle corresponding to an open queue. A client MUST call the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section [3.1.4.2)](#Section_3.1.4.2) method or the R_OpenQueueForMove (Opnum 11) (section [3.1.4.11)](#Section_3.1.4.11) method to create a queue context handle and the R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section [3.1.4.3)](#Section_3.1.4.3) method to delete a queue context handle.

Two [**IDL**](#gt_interface-definition-language-idl) types are defined to represent these queue context handles, namely [QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1)](#Section_2.2.4.1) and [QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.2)](#Section_2.2.4.2). These two types are identical on the wire, but are defined separately so as to allow the serialization mode to be configured. Refer to [[MSDN-MMSCH]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=151562) for details on modes of the context handles.

<a id="Section_2.2.4.1"></a>
#### 2.2.4.1 QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE

QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE is an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) context handle representing an open [**queue**](#gt_queue). Refer to [[MSDN-MMSCH]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=151562) for details on modes of the context handles. For the QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE context handle, there can be more than one pending RPC call on the server. On the wire it is identical to QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE (section [2.2.4.2](#Section_2.2.4.2)).

This type is declared as follows:

typedef [context_handle] void* QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE;

The context handle MUST NOT be type_strict, but it MUST be strict. More details on RPC context handles are specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) sections 4.2.16.6, 5.1.6, and 6.1 and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) sections 3.1.1.5.3.2.2.2 and 3.3.1.4.1.

<a id="Section_2.2.4.2"></a>
#### 2.2.4.2 QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE

QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE is an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) context handle representing an open [**queue**](#gt_queue). Refer to [[MSDN-MMSCH]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=151562) for details on modes of the context handles. For this context handle, there can be no more than one pending RPC call on the server. On the wire it is identical to [QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1)](#Section_2.2.4.1).

This type is declared as follows:

typedef [context_handle] QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE;

The context handle MUST NOT be type_strict, but it MUST be strict. More details on RPC context handles are specified in [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) sections 4.2.16.6, 5.1.6, and 6.1 and [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) sections 3.1.1.5.3.2.2.2 and 3.3.1.4.1.

### 2.2.5 Message Packet Structure

The **Message Packet Structure** is the data structure that contains the **UserMessage** and other headers that represent the payload that is transferred across the wire as a result of a remote read operation. More details are specified in R_StartReceive (Opnum 7) (section [3.1.4.7)](#Section_3.1.4.7) and R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section [3.1.4.13)](#Section_3.1.4.13).

<a id="Section_2.2.5.1"></a>
#### 2.2.5.1 UserMessage

The **UserMessage** structure can be either a [Binary Message (section 2.2.5.1.1)](#Section_2.2.5.1.1) or an [SRMP Message (section 2.2.5.1.2)](#Section_2.2.5.1.2), depending on the transport over which the [**message**](#gt_message) was originally sent. A Binary Message is sent over the MSMQ: Binary Reliable Messaging Protocol [MS-MQQB](../MS-MQQB/MS-MQQB.md), while an **SRMP Message** is sent over HTTP. The message type is indicated by the **UserHeader.Flags.AH** bit field, which is set for **SRMP Messages** as specified in the definition of the **UserHeaderEnd** field in this section.

```

**BaseHeader (16 bytes):** A **BaseHeader** ([MS-MQMQ](../MS-MQMQ/MS-MQMQ.md) section 2.2.19.1). The **TimeToReachQueue** field has the same length and format as that specified in [MS-MQMQ] but differs in that it represents the absolute expiration time of the message as the number of seconds elapsed since midnight (00:00:00), January 1, 1970 [**Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**](#gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc).

**UserHeader (variable):** A **UserHeader** ([MS-MQMQ] section 2.2.19.2) with the following field overlays, which pertain when the **UserHeader** specifies that the destination [**queue**](#gt_queue) is a [**direct format name**](#gt_direct-format-name). In this case, the **QueueManagerAddress** field specifies the host address from which a message was received. If the **UserHeader** specifies that the destination queue is anything other than a direct format name, the 16 bytes after the **SourceQueueManager** field are set to the GUID of the host from which the message was received, as specified in [MS-MQMQ] section 2.2.19.2.

**SourceQueueManager (16 bytes):** A **GUID** ([MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.3.4.1) that identifies the sender of the message.

**AddressLength (2 bytes):** A **USHORT** ([MS-DTYP] section 2.2.58) that MUST be the actual address length in the **Address** field.

**AddressType (2 bytes):** A **USHORT** that MUST be set to one of the following values.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| IP_ADDRESS_TYPE 0x0001 | The address specified in the **Address** field is an IPv4 address. |
| IPV6_ADDRESS_TYPE 0x0006 | The address specified in the **Address** field is an IPv6 address. |

**AddressScope (4 bytes):** A **ULONG** ([MS-DTYP] section 2.2.51) that MUST be set either to the IPv6 address scope if the **AddressType** field is IPV6_ADDRESS_TYPE or otherwise to 0x00000000. More details are specified in [[RFC2553]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90367) section 3.3.

**Address (8 bytes):** An 8-byte array of **UCHAR** ([MS-DTYP] section 2.2.45) that MUST contain the address of the host from which the message was received. The field MUST contain as much of the address as can fit in the field. More details are specified in [RFC2553] section 3.3.

**UserHeaderEnd (variable):** A variable-length buffer mapped by a **UserHeader** beginning with the **TimeToBeReceived** field. Within the **Flags** field, the **AH** bit field MUST be set only if both the **SOAPEnvelope** and the **SOAPCompoundMessage** ADM attributes of the **Message** ([MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.1.12) ADM element are populated.

**CompoundMessageHeader (variable):** A [CompoundMessageHeader (section 2.2.5.1.2.2)](#Section_2.2.5.1.2.2).

**SoapHeader (variable):** A **SoapHeader** ([MS-MQMQ] section 2.2.20.7).

**MultiQueueFormatHeader (variable):** A **MultiQueueFormatHeader** ([MS-MQMQ] section 2.2.20.1).

**SessionHeader (16 bytes):** A **SessionHeader** ([MS-MQMQ] section 2.2.20.4). The **SessionHeader** is used to acknowledge express and recoverable **UserMessage Packet**s ([MS-MQMQ] section 2.2.20) when they are sent on a session. This header MUST be present if and only if the **BaseHeader.Flags.SH** bit field of the **UserMessage Packet** is set. This bit is set when the **SessionHeader** is piggy-backed onto a **UserMessage Packet** instead of sending it in a stand-alone **SessionAck Packet** ([MS-MQQB] section 2.2.6).

More details about the following individual headers, with the exceptions of SRMPEnvelopeHeader (section 2.2.5.1.2.1) and CompoundMessageHeader (section 2.2.5.1.2.2), are specified in [MS-MQQB] section 2.2.20.

In addition, the following exceptions also exist on the field attributes as specified in [MS-MQQB]. The overall structure of the data is the same; however, particular fields have been overridden or have different meanings in this protocol. The size of each overridden field is the same size as the original field.

**UserMessage.BaseHeader.TimeToReachQueue**

The definition for **TimeToReachQueue** differs from what is specified in [MS-MQQB] section 2.2.20 in the following manner:

- In [MS-MQQB], this field indicates the length of time, in seconds, that a **UserMessage Packet** has to reach its destination [**queue manager**](#gt_queue-manager-qm).
- In [MS-MQRR](#Section_9edbc8fa02ad4c79804f6bb8f430aac1), this field indicates the absolute expiration time of the message defined as the number of seconds elapsed since midnight (00:00:00), January 1, 1970 UTC.

### 2.2.6 SectionBuffer

A **SectionBuffer** represents a fragment or section of a Message Packet (section [2.2.5](#Section_2.2.5)). Operations R_StartReceive (Opnum 7) (section [3.1.4.7](#Section_3.1.4.7)) and R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section [3.1.4.13](#Section_3.1.4.13)) fragment a **Message Packet** into an array of one or more **SectionBuffer** structures. The client concatenates these fragments to reconstruct a valid **Message Packet**. There can be up to two sections per [**message**](#gt_message). A **Message Packet** is split into two sections only when a subset of the distinguished [**message body**](#gt_message-body) property is returned. The first section always contains the message body property up to the size requested.

typedef struct _SectionBuffer {

SectionType SectionBufferType;

DWORD SectionSizeAlloc;

DWORD SectionSize;

[unique, size_is(SectionSize)] byte* pSectionBuffer;

} SectionBuffer;

**SectionBufferType:** MUST specify a type for the **SectionBuffer** structure that indicates whether the **pSectionBuffer** member contains the whole **Message Packet** or MUST indicate which section is contained. The SectionType (section [2.2.7](#Section_2.2.7)) enumeration lists possible values. More details are specified in 2.2.7.

**SectionSizeAlloc:** MUST specify the original size (in bytes) of the part of the **Message Packet** that this **SectionBuffer** represents. When the **SectionBuffer** represents the first section of the message, this field specifies the size that the **SectionBuffer** would have been if the entire message body property were included. The difference between the values of the **SectionSizeAlloc** member and the **SectionSize** member represents the size of the message body that was not transferred.

If the **SectionBufferType** member value is stFullPacket, stBinarySecondSection, or stSrmpSecondSection, then the **SectionSizeAlloc** member value MUST be equal to the **SectionSize** member value.

If the **SectionBufferType** member value is stBinaryFirstSection or stSrmpFirstSection, then the **SectionSizeAlloc** member value MUST be equal to or greater than the **SectionSize** member value.

**SectionSize:** MUST be the size (in bytes) of the buffer pointed to by the **pSectionBuffer** member. The **SectionSize** member specifies the size of the part of the **Message Packet** contained in the **pSectionBuffer** member.

**pSectionBuffer:** MUST be a pointer to an array of bytes containing a section of the **Message Packet**.

<a id="Section_2.2.7"></a>
### 2.2.7 SectionType

The **SectionType** enumeration defines the available [SectionBuffer (section 2.2.6)](#Section_2.2.6) types.

typedef enum

{

stFullPacket = 0,

stBinaryFirstSection = 1,

stBinarySecondSection = 2,

stSrmpFirstSection = 3,

stSrmpSecondSection = 4

} SectionType;

**stFullPacket:** The **pSectionBuffer** member of the **SectionBuffer** structure contains a complete [Message Packet Structure (section 2.2.5)](#Section_2.2.5). The [UserMessage (section 2.2.5.1)](#Section_2.2.5.1) is either that specified in section [2.2.5.1.1](#Section_2.2.5.1.1) or in section [2.2.5.1.2](#Section_2.2.5.1.2).

**stBinaryFirstSection:** The **pSectionBuffer** member of the **SectionBuffer** structure contains the first section of the Binary Message (section 2.2.5.1.1) packet up to, but not beyond, the **MessagePropertiesHeader** ([MS-MQMQ](../MS-MQMQ/MS-MQMQ.md) section 2.2.19.3) in the **UserMessage**.

**stBinarySecondSection:** The **pSectionBuffer** member of the **SectionBuffer** structure contains the second section of the **Binary Message** packet from beyond the end of the **MessagePropertiesHeader** in the **UserMessage** to the end of the packet.

**stSrmpFirstSection:** The **pSectionBuffer** member of the **SectionBuffer** structure contains the first section of the SRMP Message packet up to, but not beyond, the [CompoundMessageHeader (section 2.2.5.1.2.2)](#Section_2.2.5.1.2.2) in the **UserMessage**.

**stSrmpSecondSection:** The **pSectionBuffer** member of the **SectionBuffer** structure contains the second section of the SRMP Message packet from beyond the end of the **CompoundMessageHeader** in the **UserMessage** to the end of the packet.

### 2.2.8 XACTUOW

The **XACTUOW** ([MS-MQMQ](../MS-MQMQ/MS-MQMQ.md) section 2.2.18.1.8) structure uniquely identifies the unit of work (UOW) for a transactional operation. For an external transaction, this value MUST be acquired from the transaction coordinator. For an internal transaction, a client MUST create a unique random value for each transaction.<9>

<a id="Section_2.3"></a>
## 2.3 Directory Service Schema Elements

This protocol uses ADM elements specified in section [3.1.1](#Section_3.1.1). A subset of these elements can be published in a [**directory**](#gt_directory). This protocol accesses the directory using the algorithm specified in [MS-MQDSSM](../MS-MQDSSM/MS-MQDSSM.md) and using LDAP [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md). The Directory Service schema elements for ADM elements published in the directory are defined in [MS-MQDSSM] section 2.4.

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

The abstract data model for this protocol comprises elements that are private to this protocol and others that are shared between multiple [**MSMQ**](#gt_microsoft-message-queuing-msmq) protocols that are co-located at a common [**queue manager**](#gt_queue-manager-qm). The shared abstract data model is defined in [MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.1, and the relationship between this protocol, a queue manager, and other protocols that share a common queue manager is described in [MS-MQOD](#Section_1.3).

Section [3.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.1.1) specifies the abstract data model (ADM) elements from the shared data model that are manipulated by this protocol, and sections [3.1.1.2](#Section_3.1.1.2) through [3.1.1.4](#Section_3.1.1.4) specify the ADM elements that are private to this protocol.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.1"></a>
#### 3.1.1.1 Shared Data Elements

This protocol manipulates the following ADM elements from the shared abstract data model.

**Cursor:** [MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.2.

**Message:** [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.12.

**Queue:** [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.2.

**QueueManager:** [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.1.

**Transaction:** [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.14.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.2"></a>
#### 3.1.1.2 PendingRequestEntry

The **PendingRequestEntry** ADM element encapsulates a pending request to peek or receive a [**message**](#gt_message) from an open [**queue**](#gt_queue) and specifies the following ADM attributes:

**RequestId:** The request ID supplied by the client.

**LookupIdentifier:** The **LookupIdentifier** ADM attribute of a **Message** ([MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.1.12) ADM element instance associated with the request.

**QueueContextHandle:** An RPC context handle corresponding to an open queue, as defined by [QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1)](#Section_2.2.4.1).

**TimeStamp:** A 32-bit unsigned integer that represents the time, in milliseconds, at which the client request was received.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.3"></a>
#### 3.1.1.3 PendingRequestTable

The **PendingRequestTable** ADM element represents a hash table that contains references to [PendingRequestEntry (section 3.1.1.2)](#Section_3.1.1.2) ADM element instances keyed on {**PendingRequestEntry.RequestId**, **PendingRequestEntry.QueueContextHandle**}.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.4"></a>
#### 3.1.1.4 Message

The local **Message** ADM element extends the base **Message** ([MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.1.10) ADM element.

The server MUST maintain private state for each local **Message** ADM element instance in addition to the state specified by the **Message** ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.10) ADM element. The following additional ADM attributes are specified to reference this private state:

**Type:** The type of the message packet, either binary or SRMP.

**Offset:** The offset and byte size of the [**message headers**](#gt_message-header), [**message body**](#gt_message-body), and [**message trailers**](#gt_message-trailer).

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

The Message Queuing (MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read protocol MUST maintain the following timers:

- [RPC Call Timeout Timer (section 3.1.2.1)](#Section_3.1.2.1)
- [Pending Request Cleanup Timer (section 3.1.2.2)](#Section_3.1.2.2)
<a id="Section_3.1.2.1"></a>
#### 3.1.2.1 RPC Call Timeout Timer

This protocol uses nondefault behavior for the RPC Call Timeout Timer, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.3.2.2.2. This protocol uses a timer value of 300,000 milliseconds<10>, which applies to the following method calls:

- R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section [3.1.4.2)](#Section_3.1.4.2)
- R_OpenQueueForMove (Opnum 11) (section [3.1.4.11)](#Section_3.1.4.11)
- R_QMEnlistRemoteTransaction (Opnum 12) (section [3.1.4.12)](#Section_3.1.4.12)
The server MUST maintain a per-call timer for each call to the R_StartReceive (Opnum 7) (section [3.1.4.7)](#Section_3.1.4.7) method or the R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section [3.1.4.13)](#Section_3.1.4.13) method in which the *dwTimeout* parameter is nonzero. The timer MUST be set to the *dwTimeout* parameter that is specified on the call.

<a id="Section_3.1.2.2"></a>
#### 3.1.2.2 Pending Request Cleanup Timer

This timer regulates the amount of time that the protocol waits before removing expired entries from the [PendingRequestTable (section 3.1.1.3)](#Section_3.1.1.3) ADM element. The server MUST maintain a per-call timer for each call to the R_StartReceive (Opnum 7) (section [3.1.4.7)](#Section_3.1.4.7) method or the R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section [3.1.4.13)](#Section_3.1.4.13) method. This timer is set when a [PendingRequestEntry (section 3.1.1.2)](#Section_3.1.1.2) ADM element instance is added to the **PendingRequestTable** ADM element. The duration of this timer MUST be set based on the system configuration, which is implementation-dependent.<11>

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The server MUST listen on the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocols, as specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

This protocol MUST indicate to the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) runtime that it is to perform a strict [**NDR**](#gt_network-data-representation-ndr) data consistency check at target level 6.0, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 3.

This protocol MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to reject a NULL unique or full pointer with nonzero conformant value, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 3.

The **RemoteRead** interface includes the following methods.

Methods in RPC Opnum Order

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |

**Note** In the preceding table, the term "Reserved for local use" means that the client MUST NOT send the opnum and the server behavior is undefined since it does not affect interoperability.<12>

<a id="Section_3.1.4.1"></a>
#### 3.1.4.1 R_GetServerPort (Opnum 0)

The R_GetServerPort method returns the [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) [**endpoint**](#gt_endpoint) port for the client to use in subsequent method calls on the **RemoteRead** interface.

The server MUST return the TCP port number for the **RemoteRead** RPC interface. The default port number used is 2103. If this port is already in use, the server SHOULD increment the port number by 11 until an unused port is found.

The client MAY call this method prior to calling any other method on the protocol. The client MAY use the returned value to obtain another RPC binding handle to use with the remaining methods on the protocol.<13>

DWORD R_GetServerPort(

[in] handle_t hBind

);

**hBind:** MUST specify an RPC binding handle parameter, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**Return Values:** On success, this method MUST return a nonzero TCP port value for the RPC interface. If an error occurs, the server MUST return 0x00000000.

Exceptions Thrown:

No exceptions are thrown except those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol, as specified in [MS-RPCE].

As specified in section [3.1.3](#Section_3.2.3), this protocol configures a fixed listening endpoint at an RPC port number that can vary. This method returns the RPC port number determined at server initialization time.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.2"></a>
#### 3.1.4.2 R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2)

The R_OpenQueue method opens a [**queue**](#gt_queue) in preparation for subsequent operations against it. This method MUST be called prior to calling any of the following operations:

- R_CreateCursor (Opnum 4) (section [3.1.4.4)](#Section_3.1.4.4)

This method returns a [QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.2)](#Section_2.2.4.2) handle value, which is required as input in the operations listed preceding.

void R_OpenQueue(

[in] handle_t hBind,

[in] QUEUE_FORMAT* pQueueFormat,

[in] DWORD dwAccess,

[in] DWORD dwShareMode,

[in] GUID* pClientId,

[in] LONG fNonRoutingServer,

[in] unsigned char Major,

[in] unsigned char Minor,

[in] USHORT BuildNumber,

[in] LONG fWorkgroup,

[out] QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE* pphContext

);

**hBind:** MUST specify an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding handle parameter, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**pQueueFormat:** MUST be a pointer to a **QUEUE_FORMAT** ([MS-MQMQ](../MS-MQMQ/MS-MQMQ.md) section 2.2.7) structure that identifies the queue to open. NULL is invalid for this parameter. The valid values for the **m_qft** member are QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_PUBLIC, QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_PRIVATE, QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_DIRECT, QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_MACHINE, and QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_SUBQUEUE.

**dwAccess:** Specifies the requested type of access to the queue. The required *dwAccess* parameter value for each event is specified in each of the corresponding events. If no requirement is listed, any *dwAccess* parameter value is accepted.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| RECEIVE_ACCESS 0x00000001 | The returned **QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE** handle can be used in the **R_StartReceive** or **R_StartTransactionalReceive** methods with the *ulAction* parameter set to either a Peek or Receive action type as defined in the table under the *ulAction* parameter in the **R_StartReceive** method. |
| PEEK_ACCESS 0x00000020 | The returned **QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE** handle can be used in the **R_StartReceive** method with the *ulAction* parameter set only to a Peek action type as defined in the table under the *ulAction* parameter in the **R_StartReceive** method. |

**dwShareMode:** Specifies whether the client needs exclusive access to the queue. The following values are valid for this parameter:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| MQ_DENY_NONE 0x00000000 | Permits multiple **QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE** handles to the queue to be opened concurrently. |
| MQ_DENY_SHARE 0x00000001 | Permits a single **QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE** handle to the queue at a time, providing exclusive access to the queue. |

**pClientId:** MUST be set by the client to a pointer to a valid [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) that uniquely identifies the client. When the [**queue manager**](#gt_queue-manager-qm) acts as the client, the queue manager sets this value to the **Identifier** ADM attribute of the local **QueueManager** ADM element instance. The server SHOULD ignore this parameter. The server MAY<14> use this parameter to impose a limit on the number of unique callers. NULL is invalid for this parameter.

**fNonRoutingServer:** If the client is configured to operate in the role of an [**MSMQ routing server**](#gt_msmq-routing-server), this parameter MUST be set to FALSE (0x00000000); otherwise, it MUST be set to TRUE (0x00000001).<15> If the value of the *fNonRoutingServer* parameter is FALSE (0x00000000), the server MUST ignore the *pClientId* parameter.

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| False | 0x00000000 |
| True | 0x00000001 |

**Major:** MUST be set by the client to an implementation-specific Major Version number of the client. SHOULD<16> be ignored by the server.

**Minor:** MUST be set by the client to an implementation-specific Minor Version number of the client. SHOULD<17> be ignored by the server.

**BuildNumber:** MUST be set by the client to an implementation-specific Build Number of the client. SHOULD<18> be ignored by the server.

**fWorkgroup:** MUST be set to TRUE (0x00000001) by the client if the client machine is not a member of a Windows domain; otherwise, it MUST be set to FALSE (0x00000000). The RPC [**authentication level**](#gt_authentication-level) required by the server MAY<19> be based on this value in subsequent calls on the interface.

| Name | Value |

| False | 0x00000000 |
| True | 0x00000001 |

**pphContext:** MUST be set by the server to a **QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE** handle.

**Return Values:** The method has no return values. If the method fails, an RPC exception is thrown.

Exceptions Thrown:

In addition to the exceptions thrown by the underlying RPC protocol, as specified in [MS-RPCE], the method throws HRESULT failure codes as RPC exceptions. The client MUST treat all thrown HRESULT codes identically. The client MUST disregard all output parameter values when any failure HRESULT is thrown.

When processing this call, the server MUST do the following:

- If any of the input parameter values is invalid, throw MQ_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER (0xC00E0006).
- Look up the queue name in the **QueueCollection** ADM attribute of the local **QueueManager** ADM element instance. If not found, throw MQ_ERROR_QUEUE_NOT_FOUND (0xC00E0003).

HRESULT R_PurgeQueue(

[in] handle_t hBind,

[in] QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE phContext

);

**hBind:** MUST specify an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding handle parameter, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.7"></a>
#### 3.1.4.7 R_StartReceive (Opnum 7)

The **R_StartReceive** method peeks or receives a [**message**](#gt_message) from an open [**queue**](#gt_queue).

If the **R_StartReceive** method is invoked with a Peek action type, as specified in the *ulAction* parameter, the operation completes when the **R_StartReceive** method returns.

If the **R_StartReceive** method is invoked with a Receive action type, as specified in the *ulAction* parameter, the client MUST pair each call to the **R_StartReceive** method with a call to the R_EndReceive (Opnum 9) (section [3.1.4.9)](#Section_3.1.4.9) method to complete the operation, or to the R_CancelReceive (Opnum 8) (section [3.1.4.8)](#Section_3.1.4.8) method to cancel the operation. The call to the **R_EndReceive** method or the **R_CancelReceive** method is correlated to a call to the **R_StartReceive** method through matching *dwRequestId* parameters.

If the client specifies a nonzero *ulTimeout* parameter, and a message is not available in the queue at the time of the call, the server waits up to the specified time-out for a message to become available in the queue before responding to the call. The client can call the **R_CancelReceive** method with a matching *dwRequestId* parameter to cancel the pending **R_StartReceive** method request.

The message to be returned can be specified in one of three ways:

- LookupId: A nonzero *LookupId* parameter value specifies the unique identifier for the message to be returned. The *ulAction* parameter further specifies whether the message to be returned is the one identified by the *LookupId* parameter or the first unlocked message immediately preceding or following it. For more details, see the description of the *ulAction* parameter.
- Cursor: A nonzero [**cursor**](#gt_cursor) handle specifies the cursor to be used to identify the message to be returned. The cursor specifies a location in the queue. The *ulAction* parameter further specifies whether the message to be returned is the one identified by the cursor or the first unlocked message immediately following it. For more details, see the description of the *ulAction* parameter.
- First: if the *LookupId* parameter is set to zero and the *hCursor* parameter is set to zero, the first unlocked message in the queue can be returned. The *ulAction* parameter further specifies whether the first message is to be received or peeked.
The *ppPacketSections* parameter is the address of one or more pointers to one or more [SectionBuffer (section 2.2.6)](#Section_2.2.6) structures. The **pSectionBuffer** member of the first **SectionBuffer** structure points to the beginning of the [**message packet**](#gt_message-packet). If more than one **SectionBuffer** structure is present, the packet sections are concatenated in the order in which they appear in the array to form the entire packet. The size of each section is stored in the **SectionSizeAlloc** member of the **SectionBuffer** structure.

);

**hBind:** MUST specify an RPC binding handle parameter, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**phContext:** MUST be set by the client to a [QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1)](#Section_2.2.4.1) handle of the queue from which to read a message. The handle MUST have been returned by the server in the *pphQueue* output parameter of a prior call to the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section [3.1.4.2)](#Section_3.1.4.2) method and MUST NOT have been closed through a call prior to the R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section [3.1.4.3)](#Section_3.1.4.3) method. This value MUST NOT be NULL.

The handle MUST have been opened with a *dwAccess* parameter value that permits the operation specified by the *ulAction* parameter. For more details, see the *dwAccess* parameter in the **R_OpenQueue** method.

**LookupId:** If nonzero, specifies the lookup identifier of the message to be acted on.

If the client sets the *LookupId* parameter to a nonzero value, the valid values for other parameters are as follows:

- MQ_LOOKUP_PEEK_PREV
- MQ_LOOKUP_PEEK_CURRENT
- MQ_LOOKUP_PEEK_NEXT
- MQ_LOOKUP_RECEIVE_PREV
- MQ_LOOKUP_RECEIVE_CURRENT
- MQ_LOOKUP_RECEIVE_NEXT
If the client sets the *LookupId* parameter to 0x0000000000000000, all of the preceding values of the *ulAction* parameter are invalid.

**hCursor:** If nonzero, specifies a handle to a cursor that MUST have been obtained from a prior call to the R_CreateCursor (Opnum 4) (section [3.1.4.4)](#Section_3.1.4.4) method. The handle MUST NOT have been closed through a prior call to the R_CloseCursor (Opnum 5) (section [3.1.4.5)](#Section_3.1.4.5) method.

If the client sets the *hCursor* parameter to a nonzero value, the valid values for other parameters are as follows:

- *LookupId* set to 0x0000000000000000
- *ulAction* set to one of the following:
- MQ_ACTION_RECEIVE
- MQ_ACTION_PEEK_CURRENT
- MQ_ACTION_PEEK_NEXT
**ulAction:** Specifies the action to perform on the message. The following table lists possible actions.

| Type / Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| MQ_ACTION_RECEIVE 0x00000000 | If the *hCursor* parameter is nonzero, read and remove the message for the current cursor location, and advance the cursor to the next position. If the *hCursor* parameter is 0x00000000, read and remove the message from the front of the queue. The valid values for other parameters are as follows: *LookupId* set to 0x0000000000000000. |
| MQ_ACTION_PEEK_CURRENT 0x80000000 | If the *hCursor* parameter is nonzero, read the message at the current cursor location, but do not remove it from the queue. If the *hCursor* parameter is 0x00000000, read the message at the front of the queue, but do not remove it from the queue. The valid values for other parameters are as follows: *LookupId* set to 0x0000000000000000. |
| MQ_ACTION_PEEK_NEXT 0x80000001 | If the *hCursor* parameter is nonzero, advance the cursor to the next position and read the message, but do not remove it from the queue. The valid values for other parameters are as follows: *LookupId* set to 0x0000000000000000. *hCursor* set to a nonzero cursor handle obtained from the **R_CreateCursor** method. |
| MQ_LOOKUP_PEEK_CURRENT 0x40000010 | Read the message specified by the *LookupId* parameter, but do not remove it from the queue. The valid values for other parameters are as follows: *LookupId* set to a nonzero value. *hCursor* set to 0x00000000. *ulTimeout* set to 0x00000000. |
| MQ_LOOKUP_PEEK_NEXT 0x40000011 | Read the message following the message specified by the *LookupId* parameter, but do not remove it. The valid values for other parameters are as follows: *LookupId* set to a nonzero value. *hCursor* set to 0x00000000. *ulTimeout* set to 0x00000000. |
| MQ_LOOKUP_PEEK_PREV 0x40000012 | Read the message preceding the message specified by the *LookupId* parameter, but do not remove it from the queue. The valid values for other parameters are as follows: *LookupId* set to a nonzero value. *hCursor* set to 0x00000000. *ulTimeout* set to 0x00000000. |
| MQ_LOOKUP_RECEIVE_CURRENT 0x40000020 | Read the message specified by the *LookupId* parameter, and remove it from the queue. The valid values for other parameters are as follows: *LookupId* set to a nonzero value. *hCursor* set to 0x00000000. *ulTimeout* set to 0x00000000. |
| MQ_LOOKUP_RECEIVE_NEXT 0x40000021 | Read the message following the message specified by the *LookupId* parameter, and remove it from the queue. The valid values for other parameters are as follows: *LookupId* set to a nonzero value. *hCursor* set to 0x00000000. *ulTimeout* set to 0x00000000. |

If the *hCursor* parameter is 0x00000000 and the *LookupId* parameter is 0x0000000000000000, the valid values for the *ulAction* parameter are as follows:

- MQ_ACTION_RECEIVE
- MQ_ACTION_PEEK_CURRENT
**ulTimeout:** Specifies the time-out, in milliseconds, to wait for a message to become available in the queue. The valid value for this parameter is 0x00000000 if the *LookupId* parameter value is nonzero or if the action is not MQ_ACTION_RECEIVE, MQ_ACTION_PEEK_CURRENT, or MQ_ACTION_PEEK_NEXT.

**dwRequestId:** MUST be set by the client to a unique correlation identifier for the receive request. This value MUST be used in a subsequent call to the **R_EndReceive** method or the **R_CancelReceive** method to correlate that call with the call to the **R_StartReceive** method. The value MUST NOT be used in another **R_StartReceive** method call on the same **QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE** handle until a call to either the **R_EndReceive** method or the **R_CancelReceive** method with the same *dwRequestId* parameter value has been completed.

**dwMaxBodySize:** MUST be set by the client to the maximum size, in bytes, of the [**message body**](#gt_message-body) to be returned. The server SHOULD ignore this parameter when the message is not a [Binary Message (section 2.2.5.1.1)](#Section_2.2.5.1.1).

**dwMaxCompoundMessageSize:** MUST be set by the client to the maximum size, in bytes, of the [CompoundMessageHeader (section 2.2.5.1.2.2)](#Section_2.2.5.1.2.2). The server SHOULD ignore this parameter when the message is not an [SRMP Message (section 2.2.5.1.2)](#Section_2.2.5.1.2).

**pdwArriveTime:** The server MUST set this value to the time that the message was added to the queue ([MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.7.3.1), expressed as the number of seconds elapsed since midnight 00:00:00.0, January 1, 1970 [**UTC**](#gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc).

**pSequenceId:** The server MUST set this parameter to the least significant 7 bytes of the **Message.LookupIdentifier** of the message that is received by this request.

**pdwNumberOfSections:** The server MUST set this parameter to the number of entries in the array pointed to by the *ppPacketSections* parameter.

**ppPacketSections:** The server MUST set this parameter to an array of pointers to **SectionBuffer** structures. The server MUST fill this array in the following manner:

- Create two local variables of type DWORD called *maxMessageSize* and *actualMessageSize*. Assign the following values to these variables:
If the message is a Binary Message (section 2.2.5.1.1):

- *maxMessageSize* := *dwMaxBodySize*
- *actualMessageSize* := message packet body size
If the message is an SRMP Message (section 2.2.5.1.2):

- *maxMessageSize* := *dwMaxCompoundMessageSize*
- *actualMessageSize* := size in bytes of **CompoundMessageHeader**
- If the value of *maxMessageSize* is greater than or equal to *actualMessageSize*, the *ppPacketSections* parameter MUST contain a single entry as follows:
- [SectionType (section 2.2.7)](#Section_2.2.7) MUST be set to stFullPacket (0x00000000).
- The **SectionSize** and **SectionSizeAlloc** elements MUST be set to the message packet size.
- The **pSectionBuffer** member MUST contain the entire message packet.
- If the value of *maxMessageSize* is less than *actualMessageSize*, the array MUST contain a first entry as follows:
- **SectionType** MUST be set to one of the following:
- stBinaryFirstSection if the message packet is a binary packet.
- stSrmpFirstSection if the message packet is an SRMP packet.
- The **pSectionBuffer** member MUST contain the [**message packet headers**](#gt_message-packet-header) concatenated with the first *maxMessageSize* bytes of the message body.
- The **SectionSizeAlloc** member MUST be set to the message packet header size plus *actualMessageSize*.
- The **SectionSize** member MUST be set to the size of the **pSectionBuffer** member.
- If the value of *maxMessageSize* is less than *actualMessageSize* and the [**message packet trailers**](#gt_message-packet-trailer) are not empty, the array MUST contain a second entry as follows:
- **SectionType** MUST be set to one of the following:
- stBinarySecondSection if the message packet is a binary packet.
- stSrmpSecondSection if the message packet is an SRMP packet.
- The **pSectionBuffer** member MUST contain the message packet trailers.
- The **SectionSize** member and the **SectionSizeAlloc** member MUST be equal and set to the message packet trailers size.
- For the first entry in this array, the **pSectionBuffer** member points to a [Message Packet Structure (section 2.2.5)](#Section_2.2.5). Within this structure, set **UserMessage.BaseHeader.TimeToReachQueue** to **UserHeader.SentTime** + **UserMessage.BaseHeader.TimeToReachQueue**.
**Return Values:** On success, this method MUST return MQ_OK (0x00000000).

If an error occurs, the server MUST return a failure HRESULT, and the client MUST treat all failure **HRESULT**s identically. The client MUST disregard all output parameter values when any failure **HRESULT** is returned. For descriptions of the following error codes, see [MS-MQMQ](../MS-MQMQ/MS-MQMQ.md) section 2.4. For error codes not described in [MS-MQMQ], refer to [[MSDN-MQEIC]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90044).

#### 3.1.4.8 R_CancelReceive (Opnum 8)

The **R_CancelReceive** method cancels a pending call to the R_StartReceive (Opnum 7) (section [3.1.4.7)](#Section_3.1.4.7) method or the R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section [3.1.4.13)](#Section_3.1.4.13) method. Each of those methods takes a time-out parameter that can cause the server to not return a response until a [**message**](#gt_message) becomes available or the time-out expires. The **R_CancelReceive** method provides a way for the client to cancel a blocked request.

HRESULT R_CancelReceive(

[in] handle_t hBind,

[in] QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE phContext,

[in] DWORD dwRequestId

);

**hBind:** MUST be an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding handle parameter as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**phContext:** MUST be set by the client to the [QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1)](#Section_2.2.4.1) handle used in the corresponding call to the **R_StartReceive** method that is to be canceled. The handle MUST have been returned by the server in the *pphQueue* output parameter of a prior call to the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section [3.1.4.2)](#Section_3.1.4.2) method and MUST NOT have been previously closed through a call to the R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section [3.1.4.3)](#Section_3.1.4.3) method. This value MUST NOT be NULL.

**dwRequestId:** MUST be set by the client to the same value as the *dwRequestId* parameter in the corresponding call to the **R_StartReceive** method or the **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method. This parameter acts as an identifier to correlate an **R_CancelReceive** method call to an **R_StartReceive** or an **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method call.

**Return Values:** On success, this method MUST return MQ_OK (0x00000000).

If an error occurs, the server MUST return a failure **HRESULT**, and the client MUST treat all failure **HRESULTs** identically.

Exceptions Thrown:

No exceptions are thrown except those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol, as specified in [MS-RPCE].

When processing this call, the server MUST:

- Find the corresponding **OpenQueueDescriptor** ADM element instance by comparing the *phContext* parameter with the **Handle** ADM attribute for all **OpenQueueDescriptor** ADM element instances maintained by the local **QueueManager** ADM element instance.
- If not found, return a failure **HRESULT**, and perform no further actions; otherwise, assign the found **OpenQueueDescriptor** ADM element instance to the local variable *queueDesc*.
- Generate a Cancel Waiting Message Read Request ([MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.7.1.17) event with the following inputs:
- *iQueue* := *queueDesc*.**QueueReference**
- *iTag* := *dwRequestId*
- If the Cancel Waiting Message Read Request event returns an error, return a failure **HRESULT**, and perform no further actions.
- Remove the [PendingRequestEntry (section 3.1.1.2)](#Section_3.1.1.2) ADM element instance referenced by the {*phContext*, *dwRequestId*} key pair from the [PendingRequestTable (section 3.1.1.3)](#Section_3.1.1.3) ADM element.
- Respond to the pending **R_StartReceive** or **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method request with MQ_ERROR_OPERATION_CANCELLED (0xC00E0008).
<a id="Section_3.1.4.9"></a>
#### 3.1.4.9 R_EndReceive (Opnum 9)

The client MUST invoke the **R_EndReceive** method to advise the server that the [**message packet**](#gt_message-packet) returned by the R_StartReceive (Opnum 7) (section [3.1.4.7)](#Section_3.1.4.7) method has been received.

The combination of the **R_StartReceive** method and the positive acknowledgment of the **R_EndReceive** method ensures that a message packet is not lost in transit from the server to the client due to a network outage during the call sequence.

Note that a call to the R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section [3.1.4.13)](#Section_3.1.4.13) method is ended through a corresponding call to the R_EndTransactionalReceive (Opnum 15) (section [3.1.4.15)](#Section_3.1.4.15) method, not through a call to this method.

HRESULT R_EndReceive(

[in] handle_t hBind,

[in] QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE phContext,

[in, range(1,2)] DWORD dwAck,

[in] DWORD dwRequestId

);

**hBind:** MUST be an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding handle parameter for use by the server=, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**phContext:** MUST be set by the client to the [QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1)](#Section_2.2.4.1) handle used in the corresponding call to the **R_StartReceive** method. The handle MUST have been returned by the server in the *pphQueue* output parameter of a prior call to the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section [3.1.4.2)](#Section_3.1.4.2) method and MUST NOT have been closed through a prior call to the R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section [3.1.4.3)](#Section_3.1.4.3) method. This value MUST NOT be NULL.

**dwAck:** MUST be set to an Acknowledgment (ACK) or a Negative Acknowledgment (NACK) for the message packet received from the server in an **R_StartReceive** method request. The following table lists possible values.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| RR_ACK 0x00000002 | The client acknowledges that the message packet was received successfully. The server MUST remove the [**message**](#gt_message) from the [**queue**](#gt_queue) and make it unavailable for subsequent consumption. |
| RR_NACK 0x00000001 | The client acknowledges that the message packet was not received successfully. The server MUST keep the message in the queue and make it available for subsequent consumption. |

**dwRequestId:** MUST be set by the client to the same value as the *dwRequestId* parameter in the corresponding call to the **R_StartReceive** method. This parameter acts as an identifier to correlate an **R_EndReceive** method call to an **R_StartReceive** method call.

**Return Values:** On success, this method MUST return MQ_OK (0x00000000).

If an error occurs, the server MUST return a failure **HRESULT**, and the client MUST treat all failure **HRESULTs** identically.

Exceptions Thrown:

No exceptions are thrown except those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE].

When processing this call, the server MUST:

- If the queue referenced by the *phContext* parameter handle has no [PendingRequestEntry (section 3.1.1.2)](#Section_3.1.1.2) ADM element instance in its [PendingRequestTable (section 3.1.1.3)](#Section_3.1.1.3) ADM element, return MQ_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE (0xC00E0007).
- Look up the **PendingRequestEntry** ADM element instance referenced by the {*phContext*, *dwRequestId*} key pair in the **PendingRequestTable** ADM element. If a match is not found on the {*phContext*, *dwRequestId*} key pair, return MQ_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER (0xC00E0006). Otherwise, remove the **PendingRequestEntry** ADM element instance from the **PendingRequestTable** ADM element, and cancel the associated instance of the [Pending Request Cleanup Timer (section 3.1.2.2)](#Section_3.1.2.2).
- Find the corresponding **OpenQueueDescriptor** ADM element instance by comparing the *phContext* parameter with the **Handle** ADM attribute for all **OpenQueueDescriptor** ADM element instances maintained by the local **QueueManager** ADM element instance.
- If not found, return a failure **HRESULT**, and perform no further actions; otherwise, assign the found **OpenQueueDescriptor** ADM element instance to the local variable *queueDesc*.
- Find the corresponding **Message** ADM element instance by searching **OpenQueueDescriptor.QueueReference.MessagePositionCollection** for a **MessagePosition** ADM element instance where **MessagePosition.MessageReference.LookupIdentifier** equals the **LookupIdentifier** ADM attribute of the **PendingRequestEntry** ADM element instance referenced by {*phContext*, *dwRequestId*}. The corresponding **Message** ADM element instance is referred to by the **MessageReference** ADM attribute of the **MessagePosition** ADM element instance where the match was found.
- If not found, return MQ_ERROR_MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND (0xC00E0088).
- Set *rStatus* to the result of a Dequeue Message End ([MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.7.1.12) event with the following inputs:
- *iQueueDesc* := *queueDesc*.
- *iMessage* := The found **Message** ADM element instance.
- *iDeleteMessage* := True if the *dwAck* parameter is equal to RR_ACK and false if the *dwAck* parameter is equal to RR_NACK.
- Return *rStatus*.

#### 3.1.4.10 R_MoveMessage (Opnum 10)

The **R_MoveMessage** method moves a [**message**](#gt_message) from one [**queue**](#gt_queue) to another.<20> The source and destination queues MUST be related as follows:

- The source is a queue, and the destination is a [**subqueue**](#gt_subqueue) of the source queue, or
- The destination is a queue, and the source is a subqueue of the destination queue, or
- The source and destination are two subqueues of the same queue.
HRESULT R_MoveMessage(

[in] handle_t hBind,

[in] QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE phContextFrom,

[in] ULONGLONG ullContextTo,

[in] ULONGLONG LookupId,

[in] XACTUOW* pTransactionId

);

**hBind:** MUST be an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding handle parameter, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**phContextFrom:** MUST be set by the client to a [QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1)](#Section_2.2.4.1) handle representing the source queue. The handle MUST have been returned by the server in the *pphQueue* output parameter of a prior call to the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section [3.1.4.2)](#Section_3.1.4.2) method with the *dwAccess* parameter set to RECEIVE_ACCESS and MUST NOT have been closed through a prior call to the R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section [3.1.4.3)](#Section_3.1.4.3) method. This value MUST NOT be NULL.

**ullContextTo:** MUST be set by the client to the value returned by the server in the *pMoveContext* output parameter of a prior call to the R_OpenQueueForMove (Opnum 11) (section [3.1.4.11)](#Section_3.1.4.11) method and MUST NOT have been closed through a prior call to the **R_CloseQueue** method. This value MUST NOT be NULL.

**LookupId:** MUST be set by the client to the lookup identifier of the message to be moved.

**pTransactionId:** MUST be set by the client as a pointer to a transaction identifier or to a zero value **XACTUOW** ([MS-MQMQ](../MS-MQMQ/MS-MQMQ.md) section 2.2.18.1.8) structure. If the destination queue is not a transactional queue, this value MUST be a pointer to a zero value **XACTUOW** structure. If the value of the field is not zero, the transaction identifier MUST have been registered with the server through a prior call to the R_QMEnlistRemoteTransaction (Opnum 12) (section [3.1.4.12)](#Section_3.1.4.12) method and MUST NOT be NULL.

**Return Values:** On success, this method MUST return MQ_OK (0x00000000).

If an error occurs, the server MUST return a failure **HRESULT**, and the client treat all failure **HRESULTs** identically.

Exceptions Thrown:

No exceptions are thrown except those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol, as specified in [MS-RPCE].

The **R_MoveMessage** method provides both transactional and non-transactional operations. When using a transaction identifier, this method provisionally moves a message from the source queue to the destination queue, pending notification of the transaction outcome. See section [3.1.6](#Section_3.1.6). The non-transactional operation moves a message from the source queue to the destination queue without enlisting in a transaction.

When processing this call, the server MUST:

- Find the corresponding **OpenQueueDescriptor** ADM element instance for the source queue by comparing the *phContextFrom* parameter with the **Handle** ADM attribute for all **OpenQueueDescriptor** ADM element instances maintained by the local **QueueManager** ADM element instance, and then declare and set *iSourceQueueDescriptor* to the instance.
- If not found, return a failure **HRESULT**.
- Find the corresponding **OpenQueueDescriptor** ADM element instance for the destination queue by comparing the *ullContextTo* parameter with the **Handle** ADM attribute for all **OpenQueueDescriptor** ADM element instances maintained by the local **QueueManager** ADM element instance, and then declare and set *iDestinationQueueDescriptor* to that instance.
- If not found or if *iDestinationQueueDescriptor*.**AccessType** is not **QueueAccessType.MoveAccess**, then return MQ_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE (0xC00E0007).
- If none of the following conditions is met, return STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER (0xC000000D):
- *iSourceQueueDescriptor* is part of the collection *iDestinationQueueDescriptor*.**QueueReference**.**SubqueueCollection**.
- *iDestinationQueueDescriptor* is part of the collection *iSourceQueueDescriptor*.**QueueReference**.**SubqueueCollection**.
- *iSourceQueueDescriptor*.**QueueReference**.**Pathname** and *iDestinationQueueDescriptor*.**QueueReference**.**Pathname** have the same parent queue pathname. The parent queue pathname MUST be formed by removing the subqueue portion from the pathname and the preceding ";", as specified in [MS-MQMQ] section 2.1.1.
- If the method is provided with a nonzero *pTransactionId* parameter and if *iDestinationQueueDescriptor*.**QueueReference**.**Transactional** is False, return MQ_ERROR_TRANSACTION USAGE (0xC00E0050).
- Find the corresponding **Message** ADM element instance by comparing **PendingRequestEntry.LookupIdentifier** with **MessagePosition.MessageReference.Identifier** in the *iSourceQueueDescriptor*.**QueueReference**.**MessagePositionCollection**, and then declare and set *iFoundMessage* to that instance.
- If not found, then return MQ_ERROR_MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND (0xC00E0088).
- If the message is already part of another transaction, return MQ_ERROR_MESSAGE_LOCKED_UNDER_TRANSACTION (0xC00E009C).
- If the method is provided with a nonzero *pTransactionId* parameter, find the corresponding **Transaction** ADM element instance by comparing the *pTransactionId* parameter with the **Identifier** ADM attribute for all **Transaction** ADM element instances in the **TransactionCollection** ADM attribute of the local **QueueManager** ADM element instance, and then declare and set *iFoundTransaction* to that instance.
- If not found, return MQ_ERROR_TRANSACTION_SEQUENCE (0xC00E0051).
- Generate a Move Message ([MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.7.1.16) event with the following inputs:

**pQueueFormat:** MUST be a pointer to a **QUEUE_FORMAT** ([MS-MQMQ](../MS-MQMQ/MS-MQMQ.md) section 2.2.7) structure that identifies the queue to open. This value MUST NOT be NULL. The value of the **m_qft** member MUST be one of QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_PUBLIC, QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_PRIVATE, QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_DIRECT, QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_MACHINE, or QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_SUBQUEUE.

**dwAccess:** Specifies the required type of access to the queue. MUST be set by the client to MQ_MOVE_ACCESS (0x00000004).

**dwShareMode:** Specifies whether the client needs exclusive access to the queue. MUST be set by the client to MQ_DENY_NONE (0x00000000), which permits multiple QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE handles to the queue to be opened concurrently.

**pClientId:** MUST be set by the client to a pointer to a valid [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) that uniquely identifies the client. When the [**queue manager**](#gt_queue-manager-qm) acts as the client, the queue manager sets this value to the **Identifier** ADM attribute of the local **QueueManager** ADM element instance. The server SHOULD ignore this parameter. This value MUST NOT be NULL.

**fNonRoutingServer:** If the client is configured to operate in the role of an [**MSMQ routing server**](#gt_msmq-routing-server), this parameter MUST be set to FALSE (0x00000000); otherwise, it MUST be set to TRUE (0x00000001).<22> If the value of the *fNonRoutingServer* parameter is FALSE (0x00000000), the server MUST ignore the *pClientId* parameter.

**Major:** MUST be set by the client to an implementation-specific Major Version number of the client. SHOULD<23> be ignored by the server.

**Minor:** MUST be set by the client to an implementation-specific Minor Version number of the client. SHOULD<24> be ignored by the server.

**BuildNumber:** MUST be set by the client to an implementation-specific Build Number of the client. SHOULD<25> be ignored by the server.

**fWorkgroup:** MUST be set to TRUE (0x00000001) by the client if the client machine is not a member of a Windows domain; otherwise, it MUST be set to FALSE (0x00000000). The RPC [**authentication level**](#gt_authentication-level) required by the server MAY be based on this value in subsequent calls on the interface.<26>

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |

| TRUE | 0x00000001 |

**pMoveContext:** The server MUST set this to a random value that can be used as the *ullContextTo* parameter in a subsequent call to the **R_MoveMessage** method. Logically, it represents a reference to the QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE handle returned in the *pphContext* parameter.

**pphContext:** MUST be set by the server to a QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE handle. A QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE handle opened through a call to this method can be closed through a subsequent call to the R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section [3.1.4.3)](#Section_3.1.4.3) method.

**Return Values:** The method has no return values. If the method fails, an RPC exception is thrown.

Exceptions Thrown:

In addition to the exceptions thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE], the method throws **HRESULT** failure codes as RPC exceptions. The client MUST treat all thrown **HRESULT** codes identically.

The client MUST disregard all out-parameter values when any failure **HRESULT** is thrown.

When processing this call, the server MUST do the following:

- Look up the queue name in the **QueueCollection** ADM attribute of the local **QueueManager** ADM element instance. If not found, throw MQ_ERROR_QUEUE_NOT_FOUND (0xC00E0003).
- Generate an Open Queue ([MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.7.1.5) event with the following inputs:
- *iFormatName* := *pQueueFormat*
- *iRequiredAccess* := **QueueAccessType.MoveAccess**
- *iSharedMode* := If *dwShareMode* is MQ_DENY_NONE then **QueueShareMode.DenyNone** else **QueueShareMode.DenyReceive**.
- If *rStatus* is MQ_OK (0x00000000) then
- Set the *pphContext* parameter to *rOpenQueueDescriptor*.**Handle**.
- Set the *pMoveContext* parameter to a random value that logically references the handle value returned in the *pphContext* parameter.

#### 3.1.4.12 R_QMEnlistRemoteTransaction (Opnum 12)

The R_QMEnlistRemoteTransaction method propagates a distributed atomic transaction context to the server. The server MUST enlist in the transaction context. The client MUST call this method prior to the R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section [3.1.4.13)](#Section_3.1.4.13) method or the R_MoveMessage (Opnum 10) (section [3.1.4.10)](#Section_3.1.4.10) method calls.<27> Subsequent calls to the **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method and the **R_MoveMessage** method that use the same transaction identifier are coordinated such that either all occur or none occurs, depending on whether the transaction outcome is Commit or Rollback.

[in] QUEUE_FORMAT* pQueueFormat

);

**hBind:** MUST be an RPC binding handle parameter, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**pTransactionId:** MUST be a pointer to a transaction identifier obtained as specified in [MS-DTCO](../MS-DTCO/MS-DTCO.md) section 3.3.4.1. This value MUST NOT be NULL.

**cbPropagationToken:** MUST be the size, in bytes, of the *pbPropagationToken* parameter.

**pbPropagationToken:** MUST be a transaction propagation token, as specified in [MS-DTCO] section 2.2.5.4, that represents the transaction identified by the *pTransactionId* parameter. This parameter MUST NOT be NULL.

**pQueueFormat:** MUST be a pointer to a **QUEUE_FORMAT** ([MS-MQMQ](../MS-MQMQ/MS-MQMQ.md) section 2.2.7) structure that identifies the [**queue**](#gt_queue) to be passed to the **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method. SHOULD<28> be ignored by the server.

**Return Values:** On success, this method MUST return MQ_OK (0x00000000).

If an error occurs, the server MUST return a failure HRESULT, and the client MUST treat all failure **HRESULTs** identically.

**MQ_OK** (0x00000000)

Exceptions Thrown:

No exceptions are thrown except those that are thrown by the underlying [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) protocol, as specified in [MS-RPCE].

While processing this operation, the server MUST:

- Enlist into the transaction as specified in [MS-DTCO] section 3.5.4.3.
- Generate a Create Transaction ([MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.7.1.8) event with the following inputs:
- *iTransactionIdentifier* := *pTransactionId*
- Return MQ_OK (0x00000000).
<a id="Section_3.1.4.13"></a>
#### 3.1.4.13 R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13)

The **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method peeks or receives a [**message**](#gt_message) from the opened [**queue**](#gt_queue).<29> If a transaction identifier is provided, a message is received inside the specified transaction.

If the **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method is invoked with a Peek action type, as specified in the *ulAction* parameter, the operation completes when the **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method returns.

If the **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method is invoked with a Receive action type, as specified in the *ulAction* parameter, the client MUST pair each call to the **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method with a call to the R_EndTransactionalReceive (Opnum 15) (section [3.1.4.15)](#Section_3.1.4.15) method to complete the operation or to the R_CancelReceive (Opnum 8) (section [3.1.4.8)](#Section_3.1.4.8) method to cancel the operation. The call to the **R_EndTransactionalReceive** method or the **R_CancelReceive** method is correlated to a call to the **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method through matching *dwRequestId* parameters.

If the client specifies a nonzero *ulTimeout* parameter and a message is not available in the queue at the time of the call, the server waits up to the specified time-out for a message to become available in the queue before responding to the call. The client can call the **R_CancelReceive** method with a matching *dwRequestId* parameter to cancel the pending **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method request.

The message to be returned can be specified in one of three ways:

- LookupId: A nonzero *LookupId* parameter value that specifies the unique identifier for the message to be returned. The *ulAction* parameter further specifies whether the message to be returned is the one identified by the *LookupId* parameter or the first unlocked message immediately preceding or following it. For more details, see the description of the *ulAction* parameter.
- Cursor: A nonzero [**cursor**](#gt_cursor) handle that specifies the cursor to be used to identify the message to be returned. The cursor specifies a location in the queue. The *ulAction* parameter further specifies whether the message to be returned is the one identified by the cursor or the first unlocked message immediately following it. For more details, see the description of the *ulAction* parameter.
- First: If the *LookupId* parameter is set to 0x0000000000000000 and *hCursor* is set to 0x00000000, the first unlocked message in the queue can be returned. For more details, see the description of the *ulAction* parameter.
The *ppPacketSections* parameter is the address of one or more pointers to one or more [SectionBuffer (section 2.2.6)](#Section_2.2.6) structures. The **pSectionBuffer** member of the first **SectionBuffer** structure points to the beginning of the [**message packet**](#gt_message-packet). If more than one **SectionBuffer** structure is present, the packet sections are concatenated in the order in which they appear in the array to form the entire packet. The size of each section is stored in the **SectionSizeAlloc** member of the **SectionBuffer** structure.

**hBind:** MUST be an RPC binding handle parameter, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**phContext:** MUST be set by the client to a [QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1)](#Section_2.2.4.1) handle of the queue from which to read a message. The handle MUST have been returned by the server in the *pphQueue* output parameter of a prior call to the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section [3.1.4.2)](#Section_3.1.4.2) method with the *dwAccess* parameter set to RECEIVE_ACCESS and MUST NOT have been closed through a prior call to the R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section [3.1.4.3)](#Section_3.1.4.3) method. NULL is invalid for this parameter.

**LookupId:** If nonzero, specifies the lookup identifier of the message to be acted on.

If the client sets the *LookupId* parameter to a nonzero value, the valid values for other parameters are as follows:

- *ulTimeout* set to 0x00000000

- MQ_LOOKUP_PEEK_NEXT (*pTransactionId* set to NULL)
- MQ_LOOKUP_RECEIVE_PREV
- MQ_LOOKUP_RECEIVE_CURRENT
- MQ_LOOKUP_RECEIVE_NEXT
If the client sets the *LookupId* parameter to 0x0000000000000000, all of the preceding values of the *ulAction* parameter are invalid.

**hCursor:** If nonzero, specifies a handle to a cursor that MUST have been obtained from a prior call to the R_CreateCursor (Opnum 4) (section [3.1.4.4)](#Section_3.1.4.4) method. The handle MUST NOT have been closed through a prior call to the R_CloseCursor (Opnum 5) (section [3.1.4.5)](#Section_3.1.4.5) method.

If the client sets the *hCursor* parameter to a nonzero value, the valid values for other parameters are as follows:

- *LookupId* set to 0x0000000000000000.
- *ulAction* set to one of the following:

If the *hCursor* parameter is 0x00000000, read and remove the message from the front of the queue. The valid values for other parameters are as follows: *LookupId* set to 0x0000000000000000. |
| MQ_ACTION_PEEK_CURRENT 0x80000000 | If the *hCursor* parameter is nonzero, read the message at the current cursor location, but do not remove it from the queue. If the *hCursor* parameter is 0x00000000, read the message at the front of the queue, but do not remove it from the queue. The valid values for other parameters are as follows: *LookupId* set to 0x0000000000000000. *pTransactionId* set to NULL. |
| MQ_ACTION_PEEK_NEXT 0x80000001 | If the *hCursor* parameter is nonzero, advance the cursor to the next position, and read the message, but do not remove it from the queue. The valid values for other parameters are as follows: *LookupId* set to 0x0000000000000000. *hCursor* set to a nonzero cursor handle obtained from the **R_CreateCursor** method. *pTransactionId* set to NULL. |

If the *hCursor* parameter is 0x00000000 and the *LookupId* parameter is 0x0000000000000000, the valid values for the *ulAction* parameter are as follows:

- MQ_ACTION_RECEIVE
- MQ_ACTION_PEEK_CURRENT (*pTransactionId* set to NULL)
**ulTimeout:** Specifies the time-out, in milliseconds, to wait for a message to become available in the queue. The valid value for this parameter is 0x00000000 if the *LookupId* parameter value is nonzero or if the action is not MQ_ACTION_RECEIVE, MQ_ACTION_PEEK_CURRENT, or MQ_ACTION_PEEK_NEXT.

**dwRequestId:** MUST be set by the client to a unique correlation identifier for the receive request. This value MUST be used in a subsequent call to the **R_EndTransactionalReceive** method or the **R_CancelReceive** method to correlate that call with the call to the **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method. The value MUST NOT be used in another **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method call on the same **QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE** handle until a call to either the **R_EndTransactionalReceive** method or the **R_CancelReceive** method with the same *dwRequestId* parameter value has been completed.

**dwMaxBodySize:** MUST be set by the client to the maximum size, in bytes, of the [**message body**](#gt_message-body) to be returned. The server SHOULD ignore this parameter when the message is not a [Binary Message (section 2.2.5.1.1)](#Section_2.2.5.1.1).

**dwMaxCompoundMessageSize:** MUST be set by the client to the maximum size, in bytes, of the [CompoundMessageHeader (section 2.2.5.1.2.2)](#Section_2.2.5.1.2.2). The server SHOULD ignore this parameter when the message is not an [SRMP Message (section 2.2.5.1.2)](#Section_2.2.5.1.2).

**pTransactionId:** Set to NULL or set by the client to a transaction identifier that was registered with the server through a prior call to the R_QMEnlistRemoteTransaction (Opnum 12) (section [3.1.4.12)](#Section_3.1.4.12) method.

**pdwArriveTime:** The server MUST set this value to the time that the message was added to the queue ([MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.7.3.1), expressed as the number of seconds elapsed since midnight 00:00:00.0, January 1, 1970 [**UTC**](#gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc).

**pSequenceId:** The server MUST set this parameter to the lower 7 bytes of the **Message.LookupIdentifier** of the message that is received by this request.

**pdwNumberOfSections:** MUST be set by the server to the number of entries in the array that are pointed to by the *ppPacketSections* parameter.

**ppPacketSections:** MUST be set by the server to an array of pointers to SectionBuffer (section 2.2.6) structures. The server MUST fill this array in the following manner:

- Create two local variables of type DWORD called *maxMessageSize* and *actualMessageSize*. Assign the following values to these variables:
If the message is a **Binary Message**:

- *maxMessageSize* := *dwMaxBodySize*
- *actualMessageSize* := message packet body size
If the message is an **SRMP Message**:

- *maxMessageSize* := *dwMaxCompoundMessageSize*
- *actualMessageSize* := size in bytes of **CompoundMessageHeader**
- If the value of *maxMessageSize* is greater than or equal to *actualMessageSize*, the *ppPacketSections* parameter MUST contain a single entry as follows:
- The **SectionBufferType** member MUST be set to stFullPacket (0x00000000).
- The **SectionSize** and **SectionSizeAlloc** members MUST be set to the message packet size.
- The **pSectionBuffer** member MUST contain the entire message packet.
- If the value of *maxMessageSize* is less than *actualMessageSize*, the array MUST contain a first entry as follows:
The **SectionBufferType** member MUST be set to one of the following:

- stBinaryFirstSection if the message packet is a binary packet.
- stSrmpFirstSection if the message packet is an SRMP packet.
- The **pSectionBuffer** member MUST contain the [**message packet headers**](#gt_message-packet-header) concatenated with the first *maxMessageSize* bytes of the message body.
- The **SectionSizeAlloc** member MUST be set to the message packet headers plus *actualMessageSize*.
- The **SectionSize** member MUST be set to the size of the **pSectionBuffer** member.
- If the value of *maxMessageSize* is less than *actualMessageSize* and the [**message packet trailers**](#gt_message-packet-trailer) are not empty, the array MUST contain a second entry as follows:
The **SectionBufferType** member MUST be set to one of the following:

- stBinarySecondSection if the message packet is a binary packet.
- stSrmpSecondSection if the message packet is an SRMP packet.
- The **pSectionBuffer** member MUST contain the message packet trailers.
- The **SectionSize** and the **SectionSizeAlloc** members MUST be equal and MUST be set to the message packet trailers size.
- For the first entry in this array, the **pSectionBuffer** member points to a [Message Packet Structure (section 2.2.5)](#Section_2.2.5). Within this structure, set **UserMessage.BaseHeader.TimeToReachQueue** to **UserHeader.SentTime** + **UserMessage.BaseHeader.TimeToReachQueue**.
**Return Values:** On success, this method MUST return MQ_OK (0x00000000).

If an error occurs, the server MUST return a failure HRESULT, and the client MUST treat all failure **HRESULT**s identically. The client MUST disregard all output parameter values when any failure **HRESULT** is returned. For descriptions of the following error codes, see [MS-MQMQ](../MS-MQMQ/MS-MQMQ.md) section 2.4. For error codes not described in [MS-MQMQ], refer to [[MSDN-MQEIC]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90044).

- If not found, return a failure **HRESULT**.
- Find the corresponding **MessagePosition** ([MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.1.11) ADM element instance *fMessagePosition* by comparing the *LookupId* parameter with *rMessagePosition*.**MessageReference**.**Identifier** for each **MessagePosition** ADM element instance *rMessagePosition* in the *fOpenQueueDescriptor*.**QueueReference.MessagePositionList**.
- If not found, then return MQ_ERROR_MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND (0xC00E0088).
- Find the corresponding **TransactionOperation** ADM element instance *fTransactionOperation* by comparing the **MessagePosition** ADM element instance *fMessagePosition* with *rTransaction*.**TransactionalOperationCollection.MessagePositionReference** for each **Transaction** ADM element instance *rTransaction* in the **TransactionCollection** ADM attribute of the local **QueueManager** ADM element instance.
- If not found, then return MQ_ERROR_TRANSACTION_USAGE (0xC00E0050).
- If the *usClass* parameter is not 0x0000, set the **DequeueReason** ADM attribute of the **TransactionOperation** ADM element instance *fTransactionOperation* to **NackReceiveRejected**, as specified in [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.12.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.15"></a>
#### 3.1.4.15 R_EndTransactionalReceive (Opnum 15)

The client MUST invoke the **R_EndTransactionalReceive** method to advise the server that the [**message packet**](#gt_message-packet) returned by the R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section [3.1.4.13)](#Section_3.1.4.13) method has been received by the client.<31>

The combination of the **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method and the positive acknowledgment of the **R_EndTransactionalReceive** method ensures that a message packet is not lost in transit from the server to the client due to a network outage during the call sequence.

HRESULT R_EndTransactionalReceive(

[in] handle_t hBind,

[in] QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE phContext,

[in, range(1,2)] DWORD dwAck,

[in] DWORD dwRequestId

);

**hBind:** MUST be an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) binding handle parameter, as specified in [MS-RPCE](../MS-RPCE/MS-RPCE.md) section 2.

**phContext:** MUST be set by the client to the [QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE](#Section_2.2.4.1) structure used in the corresponding call to the **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method. The handle MUST have been returned by the server in the *pphQueue* output parameter of a prior call to the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section [3.1.4.2)](#Section_3.1.4.2) method and MUST NOT have been closed through a prior call to the R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section [3.1.4.3)](#Section_3.1.4.3) method. This value MUST NOT be NULL.

**dwAck:** MUST be set to an Acknowledgment (ACK) or a Negative Acknowledgment (NACK) for the message packet received from the server in an **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method request. The following table lists possible values.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| RR_ACK 0x00000002 | The client acknowledges that the message packet was received successfully. The server MUST NOT remove the packet from the [**queue**](#gt_queue). The server removes the packet from the queue when the transaction is committed. |
| RR_NACK 0x00000001 | The client acknowledges that the message packet was not received successfully. The server MUST keep the message packet and make it available for subsequent consumption. |

**dwRequestId:** MUST be set by the client to the same value as the *dwRequestId* parameter in the corresponding call to the **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method. This parameter acts as an identifier to correlate an **R_EndTransactionalReceive** method call to an **R_StartTransactionalReceive** method call.

**Return Values:** On success, this method MUST return MQ_OK (0x00000000).

If an error occurs, the server MUST return a failure HRESULT, and the client MUST treat all failure **HRESULT**s identically.

Exceptions Thrown:

No exceptions are thrown except those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol, as specified in [MS-RPCE].

When processing this call, the server MUST do the following:

- If the queue referenced by the *phContext* parameter handle has no [PendingRequestEntry (section 3.1.1.2)](#Section_3.1.1.2) ADM element instance in its [PendingRequestTable (section 3.1.1.3)](#Section_3.1.1.3) ADM element, return MQ_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE (0xC00E0007).
- Look up the **PendingRequestEntry** ADM element instance referenced by the {*phContext*, *dwRequestId*} key pair in the **PendingRequestTable** ADM element. If a match is not found on the {*phContext*, *dwRequestId*} key pair, return MQ_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER (0xC00E0006). Otherwise, remove the **PendingRequestEntry** ADM element instance from the **PendingRequestTable** ADM element, and cancel the associated instance of [Pending Request Cleanup Timer (section 3.1.2.2)](#Section_3.1.2.2).
- Find the corresponding **OpenQueueDescriptor** ADM element instance by comparing the *phContext* parameter with the **Handle** ADM attribute for all **OpenQueueDescriptor** ADM element instances maintained by the local **QueueManager** ADM element instance.
- If not found, return a failure HRESULT, and perform no further actions; otherwise, assign the found **OpenQueueDescriptor** ADM element instance to the local variable *queueDesc*.
- Find the corresponding **Message** ADM element instance *fMessage* by searching *queueDesc*.**QueueReference.MessagePositionCollection** for a **MessagePosition** ADM element instance *fMessagePosition* where *fMessagePosition*.**MessageReference.LookupIdentifier** equals the **LookupIdentifier** ADM attribute of the **PendingRequestEntry** ADM element instance referenced by {*phContext*, *dwRequestId*}. The corresponding **Message** ADM element instance *fMessage* is referenced by the **MessageReference** ADM attribute of the matching **MessagePosition** ADM element instance *fMessagePosition*.
- If not found, return MQ_ERROR_MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND (0xC00E0088).
- Set *rStatus* to the result of a Dequeue Message End ([MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.7.1.12) event with the following inputs:
- *iQueueDesc* := *queueDesc*.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

The client MUST create an [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) connection to the remote computer by using the details specified in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).

<a id="Section_3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The operation of the protocol is initiated and subsequently driven by the following higher-layer triggered events.

- The message queuing application opens a queue.
- The message queuing application enlists in a transaction.
- The message queuing application Peeks or Receives a message.
- The message queuing application rejects a received message.
- The message queuing application cancels a pending Peek or Receive.
- The message queuing application moves a message between the queue and its subqueue or between two subqueues of the same queue.
- The message queuing application purges a queue.
- The message queuing application creates a cursor.
- The message queuing application uses the cursor to Peek or Receive messages.
- The message queuing application closes the cursor.
- The message queuing application closes the queue.
<a id="Section_3.2.4.1"></a>
#### 3.2.4.1 Opening a Queue

# 4 Protocol Examples

The following sections describe several operations that are used in common scenarios in order to illustrate the function of the Message Queuing (MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read Protocol.

<a id="Section_4.1"></a>
## 4.1 Binding to a Server and Purging a Queue

The sequence diagram that follows illustrates a scenario when the client purges a [**queue**](#gt_queue). In addition, it shows how the static [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) [**endpoint**](#gt_endpoint) port is acquired by the client to create an RPC binding handle.

- The client begins the sequence by creating an RPC binding for the server. Next, the client calls the R_GetServerPort (Opnum 0) (section [3.1.4.1)](#Section_3.1.4.1) method, which returns an RPC endpoint port number with which the client creates a new binding. The client uses the new binding for all subsequent calls to the server.
- Using the binding from the previous step, the client calls the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section [3.1.4.2)](#Section_3.1.4.2) method, requesting the MQ_RECEIVE_ACCESS (0x00000001) access mode and a share mode, in addition to client-specific values for the *pClientId*, *fNonRoutingServer*, *Major*, *Minor*, *BuildNumber*, and *fWorkgroup* parameters. On success, the server returns a new [QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.2)](#Section_2.2.4.2) handle.
- The client calls the R_PurgeQueue (Opnum 6) (section [3.1.4.6)](#Section_3.1.4.6) method. The server confirms that the queue was opened with the MQ_RECEIVE_ACCESS (0x00000001) access mode and then removes all messages from the queue.
- Finally, the client closes the **QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE** handle with a call to the R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section [3.1.4.3)](#Section_3.1.4.3) method.

<a id="Section_4.2"></a>
## 4.2 Receiving a Message

This sequence diagram illustrates a client receiving a [**message**](#gt_message) from a [**queue**](#gt_queue) at the server. The call to the R_StartReceive (Opnum 7) (section [3.1.4.7)](#Section_3.1.4.7) method includes a *ulAction* parameter value of MQ_ACTION_RECEIVE (0x00000000) and a unique *dwRequestId* parameter value chosen by the client. In response, the server associates a pending request with the passed *dwRequestId* parameter, which is used to correlate a subsequent call to the R_EndReceive (Opnum 9) (section [3.1.4.9)](#Section_3.1.4.9) method or the R_CancelReceive (Opnum 8) (section [3.1.4.8)](#Section_3.1.4.8) method with the same value for the *dwRequestId* parameter. Additionally, the server returns a [SectionBuffer (section 2.2.6)](#Section_2.2.6) array that contains the message.

Next, the client indicates that the message was successfully received by calling the **R_EndReceive** method, specifying RR_ACK (0x00000002) for the *dwAck* parameter. The server completes the corresponding pending request created by the call to the **R_StartReceive** method and, because RR_ACK is specified, removes the message from the queue.

Figure 2: The client receives a message.

<a id="Section_4.3"></a>
## 4.3 Receiving a Message in a Transaction

This sequence diagram demonstrates a scenario in which a client receives a [**message**](#gt_message) from a [**queue**](#gt_queue) within the context of a transaction. Although four roles are used to illustrate the participants in this scenario, the protocol that is described by this specification is used only between the client and server roles. The "Client Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC)" role (as specified in [MS-DTCO](../MS-DTCO/MS-DTCO.md)) and the "Server DTC" role are included to illustrate a typical end-to-end sequence of a transactional receive request.

The diagram includes reference numbers on the left side that identify operations of interest, which are explained in detail following.

![The client receives a message within a transaction.](media/image3.png)

Figure 3: The client receives a message within a transaction.

- The client communicates with the local DTC to create a new transaction, as specified in [MS-DTCO] section 3.3.4.1.
- The client constructs a propagation token to be marshaled to the server's transaction manager, as specified in [MS-DTCO] section 2.2.5.4.
- The client calls the R_QMEnlistRemoteTransaction (Opnum 12) (section [3.1.4.12)](#Section_3.1.4.12) method, specifying the transaction identifier and the transaction propagation token.
- The server marshals the transaction propagation token to its local transaction manager and enlists its local resource manager in the transaction, as specified in [MS-DTCO] sections 3.3.4.12 and 3.5.4.3.
- The client calls the R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section [3.1.4.13)](#Section_3.1.4.13) method to receive a message in the context of the transaction. The client specifies the transaction identifier to associate the receive operation with the transaction enlisted in the prior steps. The server returns a message in the [SectionBuffer (section 2.2.6)](#Section_2.2.6) array.
- The client advises the server that the message was received correctly by calling the R_EndTransactionalReceive (Opnum 15) (section [3.1.4.15)](#Section_3.1.4.15) method, specifying RR_ACK (0x00000002) for the *dwAck* parameter.
- The client commits the transaction, as specified in [MS-DTCO] section 3.3.4.8.2. The client DTC transaction manager notifies the server DTC transaction manager of the commit request.
- After receiving notification of the commit from the server DTC via the DTC Transaction Commit ([MS-MQDMPR](../MS-MQDMPR/MS-MQDMPR.md) section 3.1.4.7) event, the server deletes the message from the queue.

# 5 Security

The following sections specify security considerations for implementers of the Message Queuing (MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read Protocol.

<a id="Section_5.1"></a>
## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

In addition to imposing the minimum [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) [**authentication level**](#gt_authentication-level) on the RPC handle for incoming calls, the server might require a different minimum RPC authentication level from the client, depending on whether the client is a member of a Windows domain, as specified by the *fWorkgroup* parameter in the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section [3.1.4.2)](#Section_3.1.4.2) and the R_OpenQueueForMove (Opnum 11) (section [3.1.4.11)](#Section_3.1.4.11) methods.<38>

<a id="Section_5.2"></a>
## 5.2 Index of Security Parameters

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.4: If the originating [**MSMQ**](#gt_microsoft-message-queuing-msmq) application receives [**messages**](#gt_message) from a [**remote queue**](#gt_remote-queue) through a supporting server, the [**queue manager**](#gt_queue-manager-qm) on the supporting server uses the protocol described in [MS-MQQP](../MS-MQQP/MS-MQQP.md) but does not support this protocol.

<2> Section 1.7: Windows NT operating system, Windows 2000 operating system, and the Windows XP operating system do not support this protocol.

<3> Section 1.7: Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2003 and later server operating systems use [**Kerberos**](#gt_kerberos) when the computer is a member of a Windows domain; otherwise, they use [**NTLM**](#gt_nt-lan-manager-ntlm-authentication-protocol).

<4> Section 2.1: The Windows Server 2003 protocol client uses [**RPC**](#gt_remote-procedure-call-rpc) [**dynamic endpoints**](#gt_dynamic-endpoint) to obtain the initial RPC binding handle. The client calls the R_GetServerPort (Opnum 0) (section [3.1.4.1](#Section_3.1.4.1)) method with the initial RPC binding handle and uses the returned value to obtain a new RPC binding handle to be used for all subsequent RPC method calls on the protocol. When acting as protocol clients, Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2008 and later server operating systems use RPC dynamic endpoints to obtain the RPC binding handle. This handle is used for all RPC method calls on the protocol. The **R_GetServerPort** method is not called by the Windows Vista and later client operating systems and the Windows Server 2008 and later server operating systems when acting as protocol clients.

<5> Section 2.2.5.2: The ExtensionHeader (section [2.2.5.2](#Section_2.2.5.2)) is not supported on Windows Server 2003.

<6> Section 2.2.5.3: The SubqueueHeader (section [2.2.5.3](#Section_2.2.5.3)) is not supported on Windows Server 2003.

<7> Section 2.2.5.4: The DeadLetterHeader (section [2.2.5.4](#Section_2.2.5.4)) is not supported on Windows Server 2003.

<8> Section 2.2.5.5: The ExtendedAddressHeader (section [2.2.5.5](#Section_2.2.5.5)) is not supported on Windows Server 2003.

<9> Section 2.2.8: All Windows clients produce new **XACTUOW** ([MS-MQMQ](../MS-MQMQ/MS-MQMQ.md) section 2.2.18.1.8) structure values by calling the Windows RPC function **UuidCreate**.

<10> Section 3.1.2.1: If the registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSMQ\Parameters\RpcCancelTimeout is defined and is set to a nonzero DWORD value, Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2003 and later server operating systems, when acting as protocol servers, interpret this value as the RPC Call Timeout value in minutes.

<11> Section 3.1.2.2: The Windows default timeout is 5 * 60 * 1000 milliseconds (5 minutes). This default value can be overridden by setting the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSMQ\Parameters\RpcCancelTimeout to the desired value, in minutes. This value cannot be set to zero.

<12> Section 3.1.4: Opnums reserved for local use apply to Windows as follows.

| Opnum | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Not used by Windows |

<13> Section 3.1.4.1: The Windows Server 2003 protocol client uses RPC dynamic endpoints to obtain the initial RPC binding handle. The client calls the R_GetServerPort (Opnum 0) (section 3.1.4.1) method with the initial RPC binding handle and uses the returned value to obtain a new RPC binding handle to be used for all subsequent RPC method calls on the protocol.

When acting as protocol clients, Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2008 and later server operating systems use RPC dynamic endpoints to obtain the RPC binding handle. This handle is used for all RPC method calls on the protocol. The **R_GetServerPort** method is not called by the Windows Vista and later client operating systems and the Windows Server 2008 and later server operating systems when acting as protocol clients.

<14> Section 3.1.4.2: Windows Server 2003 protocol servers limit the number of unique concurrent clients if the following DWORD registry key exists and its value is 0x00000001: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LicenseInfo\FilePrint. The maximum number of unique concurrent clients permitted is taken from the DWORD registry key HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LicenseInfo\FilePrint\ConcurrentLimit. If the number of existing unique callers is equal to this value, the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section [3.1.4.2](#Section_3.1.4.2)) method throws an RPC exception MQ_ERROR_DEPEND_WKS_LICENSE_OVERFLOW (0xc00e0067).

When acting as protocol servers, Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2008 and later server operating systems do not enforce limits on the number of unique concurrent clients. The *pClientId* parameter is ignored.

<15> Section 3.1.4.2: When acting as protocol clients, Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2003 and later server operating systems set the *fNonRoutingServer* parameter value based on the registry key HKLM\Software\Windows\MSMQ\Parameters\MachineCache\MQS_Routing.

If this key exists and is set to the DWORD value 0x00000001, the parameter is set to FALSE (0x00000000); otherwise, it is set to TRUE (0x00000001).

<16> Section 3.1.4.2: When acting as a protocol client, Windows Server 2003 sets the [**message queuing**](#gt_message-queuing) Major Version to 5. Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2008 and later server operating systems protocol clients set the message queuing Major Version to 6.

When acting as protocol servers, Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2003 and later server operating systems ignore the message queuing Major Version parameter.

<17> Section 3.1.4.2: The Windows Server 2003 protocol client sets the message queuing Minor Version to 2.

When acting as protocol clients, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 set the message queuing Minor Version to 0, while Windows 7 and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2008 R2 and later server operating systems set the message queuing Minor Version to 1.

When acting as protocol servers, the Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2003 and later server operating systems ignore the message queuing Minor Version parameter.

<18> Section 3.1.4.2: When acting as protocol clients, Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2003 and later server operating systems set the message queuing *BuildNumber* to a build-specific number.

When acting as protocol servers, Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2003 and later server operating systems ignore the message queuing *BuildNumber* parameter.

<19> Section 3.1.4.2: The Windows Server 2003 protocol server minimum RPC [**authentication level**](#gt_authentication-level) is determined as follows:

- RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_NONE, if any of the following conditions is true
- The *fWorkgroup* parameter is TRUE.
