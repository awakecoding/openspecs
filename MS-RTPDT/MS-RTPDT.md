# 1 Introduction

The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP/RTCP): DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals Data Extensions Protocol (RTPDT) is an extension to [[RFC4733]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=116566). RTPDT describes the payload format needed to carry [**DTMF**](#gt_dual-tone-multi-frequency-dtmf) digits, tones, and signals in RTP packets over a network transport.

Any behavior not explicitly defined in this document means the behavior defined in [RFC4733] must be used.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_dual-tone-multi-frequency-dtmf"></a>
**dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF)**: In telephony systems, a signaling system in which each digit is associated with two specific frequencies. This system typically is associated with touch-tone keypads for telephones.

<a id="gt_real-time-transport-protocol-rtp"></a>
**Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)**: A network transport protocol that provides end-to-end transport functions that are suitable for applications that transmit real-time data, such as audio and video, as described in [[RFC3550]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90433).

<a id="gt_session-description-protocol-sdp"></a>
**Session Description Protocol (SDP)**: A protocol that is used for session announcement, session invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation. For more information see [MS-SDP](../MS-SDP/MS-SDP.md) and [RFC3264].

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The RTP/RTCP: DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals Data Extensions protocol describes a mechanism for transmission of in-band and out-of-band telephony digits, tones, and signals. It is an extension to [[RFC4733]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=116566).

The RTPDT protocol is limited to telephony signals using out-of-band transmission. The in-band transmission of digits and tones is not supported by this protocol.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol relies on [**RTP**](#gt_real-time-transport-protocol-rtp) as specified in [MS-RTPME](../MS-RTPME/MS-RTPME.md) as its transport mechanism. This protocol can be used to communicate signaling [Dual Tone Multiple Frequency (DTMF)](../MS-GLOS/MS-GLOS.md) telephony events between clients and gateways using the RTP payload.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

This protocol is a payload of [**RTP**](#gt_real-time-transport-protocol-rtp); therefore, a valid RTP session has to be established between a client and a gateway.

Furthermore, because of the dynamic payload typing of the telephony events, out-of-band negotiation is required to bind the payload type of the RTP payload to the telephony events. This is done using the Session Description Protocol [MS-SDP](../MS-SDP/MS-SDP.md).

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is applicable wherever telephony digits, tones, or signals need to be sent or consumed either by remote clients or through gateways.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

- Supported Transports: This protocol is sent using the [**RTP**](#gt_real-time-transport-protocol-rtp) transport mechanism [MS-RTPME](../MS-RTPME/MS-RTPME.md).
- Protocol Versions: This protocol, as a format of an RTP payload, does not provide for versioning information within the scope of the protocol itself. However, as a part of the RTP payload, any versioning information about the RTP level will apply.
- Security and Authentication Methods: This specification does not describe any security or authentication methods. Security and authentication are dependent on the security method, authentication method, or both methods used by the RTP version 2 protocol.
- Localization: None.

## 2.1 Transport

The RTP/RTCP: DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones and Telephony Signals Data Extensions protocol MUST be sent using [**RTP**](#gt_real-time-transport-protocol-rtp) as specified in [MS-RTPME](../MS-RTPME/MS-RTPME.md) as its transport. This protocol assumes that a successful RTP session has been established with valid payload information.

The [**Session Description Protocol (SDP)**](#gt_session-description-protocol-sdp) [MS-SDP](../MS-SDP/MS-SDP.md) MUST be used to negotiate the payload type information.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

The structure and syntax of the RTP/RTCP: DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones and Telephony Signals Data Extensions protocol is defined in [[RFC4733]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=116566) section 2.3.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 DTMF Telephony Event

The DTMF Telephony Event format is described in [[RFC4733]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=116566) section 2.3.

<a id="Section_3"></a>
# 3 Protocol Details

The RTP/RTCP: DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals Extensions protocol conforms more to the "sender-receiver" paradigm than the classic "client-server" paradigm. More specifically, it is appropriate to discuss in terms of the receiver of the telephony signals and the sender of the telephony signals.

This specification covers the common details between the sender and receiver. It then provides the specifics of the sender and receiver details.

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Common Details

In [[RFC4733]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=116566), out-of-band negotiation of telephony signal information is required to establish a session. During this negotiation, both payload types and the clock rate of the telephony signals are negotiated as described in [RFC4733] section 2.5.1.1 using [**SDP**](#gt_session-description-protocol-sdp) for out-of-band negotiation. While dynamic payload type binding is required, both the sender and receiver of message blocks conforming to RTPDT MUST fix the telephony signaling information at 8,000 Hertz. Dynamic negotiation of the clock frequency of the [**DTMF**](#gt_dual-tone-multi-frequency-dtmf) payload MUST NOT be used.

[RFC4733] allows a "zero" duration in the payload of an RTP packet for state events. Endpoints using RTPDT MUST NOT send telephony events with a "zero" duration. Telephony events include the state and nonstate events.

All event duration values MUST NOT exceed the maximum duration expressible in the duration field of the payload format as described in [RFC4733] section 2.3.5.

Redundancy support as described in [MS-RTPRAD](../MS-RTPRAD/MS-RTPRAD.md) MUST NOT be used. Integrity for the payload is not defined by this specification; see [MS-RTPRAD] section 2.2 for payload integrity information.

Multiple payload type binding for different telephony events MUST NOT be used. There MUST be only one telephony event binding for a payload type. The payload type binding MUST be symmetrical. This means the receive payload type and send payload type MUST be the same. Asymmetrical payload type information MUST NOT be used.

RTPDT supports only the telephony event. An in-band telephony tone transmission MUST NOT be used.

All clock frequencies for DTMF signals, tones, and digits MUST be fixed at 8,000 Hertz.
