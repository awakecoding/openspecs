<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses LDAP as its primary access protocol. Active Directory stores information about a variety of objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md). Active Directory is either deployed as [**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**](#gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), which are both described in [MS-ADOD](../MS-ADOD/MS-ADOD.md): Active Directory Protocols Overview.

<a id="gt_active-directory-domain-services-ad-ds"></a>
**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**: A directory service (DS) implemented by a domain controller (DC). The DS provides a data store for objects that is distributed across multiple DCs. The DCs interoperate as peers to ensure that a local change to an object replicates correctly across DCs. AD DS is a deployment of [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md).

<a id="gt_active-directory-federation-services-ad-fs"></a>
**Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)**: A Microsoft implementation of a federation services provider, which provides a security token service (STS) that can issue security tokens to a caller using various protocols such as WS-Trust, WS-Federation, and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) version 2.0.

<a id="gt_active-directory-federation-services-ad-fs-farm"></a>
**Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) farm**: A collection of AD FS servers that is typically maintained by an enterprise to obtain greater redundancy and offer more reliable service than a single standalone AD FS server.

<a id="gt_ad-fs-farm-with-shared-artifact-store"></a>
**AD FS farm with shared artifact store**: A type of AD FS farm deployment in which all AD FS servers that are part of the farm use a shared artifact store. The protocol defined in this document is not applicable to and is not used in this type of AD FS farm deployment.

<a id="gt_ad-fs-farm-with-standalone-artifact-store"></a>
**AD FS farm with standalone artifact store**: A type of AD FS farm deployment in which each AD FS server that is part of the farm has its own local artifact store that is intended for its exclusive use and is not shared with any other member of the farm. The protocol defined in this document is applicable to this type of AD FS farm deployment.

<a id="gt_artifact"></a>
**artifact**: An object that is created by an AD FS server when it successfully processes an OAuth client's request for authorization. An artifact object is generated along with the OAuth authorization code. Before issuing an OAuth authorization code to the OAuth client, the AD FS server stores the artifact object in its artifact store. The format of the artifact is defined in section 2.2.4.2.

<a id="gt_artifact-lifetime"></a>
**artifact lifetime**: Determines the duration for which an artifact that was generated by an AD FS server is valid and persisted in the artifact store. For details, see section 3.2.2.

<a id="gt_artifact-store"></a>
**artifact store**: A local store used by an AD FS server to persist artifacts it has generated after successfully processing an OAuth authorization request.

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) have to be used for generating the GUID. See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_uniform-resource-identifier-uri"></a>
**Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**: A string that identifies a resource. The URI is an addressing mechanism defined in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax [[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453).

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

[**Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)**](#gt_active-directory-federation-services-ad-fs) servers can be deployed in [**AD FS farm**](#gt_3f0970e9-ce9e-4870-b112-ec0096345442) configurations, often behind a load-balancer, for increased scalability and reliability. The AD FS server implements the authorization server role for the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework and supports the Authorization Code Grant as defined in [[RFC6749]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301486).

[RFC6749] section 4.1 illustrates the steps required to implement the Authorization Code Grant. In cases where AD FS servers are deployed in an [**AD FS farm with standalone artifact store**](#gt_ad-fs-farm-with-standalone-artifact-store), an OAuth client can receive an OAuth authorization code from any AD FS server that is part of the AD FS farm. Subsequently, when the OAuth client attempts to redeem that authorization code for an access token according to the steps outlined in [RFC6749] section 4.1, it might be redirected to a different member of the AD FS farm. Thus, a server that belongs to the AD FS farm with standalone artifact store might receive a request to redeem an OAuth authorization code that was issued by another server in the farm. Under these circumstances, the AD FS servers use the Active Directory Federation Services OAuth Authcode Lookup (ADFSOAL) Protocol defined in this specification in order to detect which server in the farm issued the authorization code and to retrieve the corresponding [**artifact**](#gt_artifact) from that server. The artifact thus retrieved contains the OAuth access token that is thereafter provided to the OAuth client in response to its request to redeem the OAuth authorization code. Note that the ADFSOAL Protocol does not apply to AD FS servers that are deployed in an [**AD FS farm with shared artifact store**](#gt_ad-fs-farm-with-shared-artifact-store).

![Sequence diagram for the ADFSOAL Protocol](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Sequence diagram for the ADFSOAL Protocol

The above sequence diagram illustrates this flow. Two servers "AD FS server 1" and "AD FS server 2" are deployed in an AD FS farm with standalone artifact store configuration. In this scenario, the OAuth client initially received an OAuth authorization code from "AD FS server 2" using the steps defined in [RFC6749]. The OAuth client then attempts to redeem this OAuth authorization code for an access token by using the mechanism defined in [RFC6749]. However, the OAuth client is connected to "AD FS server 1", a different server than the one that originally issued the OAuth authorization code. In this scenario, "AD FS server 1" uses the ADFSOAL Protocol defined in this document to look up the artifact identifier contained within the OAuth authorization code on "AD FS server 2" and to retrieve the corresponding artifact from the [**artifact store**](#gt_artifact-store) on "AD FS server 2". The artifact thus retrieved contains the OAuth access token that is thereafter returned to the OAuth client in response to its access token request, according to the procedure defined in [RFC6749].

The ADFSOAL Protocol defines a client role and a server role. The client role of the ADFSOAL Protocol corresponds to the AD FS server that is part of the AD FS farm and needs to look up the artifact identifier contained within the authorization code presented to it by the OAuth client. The server role of the ADFSOAL Protocol corresponds to the AD FS server that is part of the same AD FS farm and originally issued the authorization code to the OAuth client.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The ADFSOAL Protocol depends on HTTP [[RFC2616]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90372).

![Protocol dependency](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: Protocol dependency

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

- The ADFSOAL Protocol is used only when AD FS servers are deployed in an [**AD FS farm with standalone artifact store**](#gt_ad-fs-farm-with-standalone-artifact-store) configuration. In this deployment configuration, all AD FS servers that belong to the farm have their own [**artifact store**](#gt_artifact-store).
- AD FS servers deployed in an [**AD FS farm with shared artifact store**](#gt_ad-fs-farm-with-shared-artifact-store) configuration do not use the ADFSOAL Protocol because they have a single artifact store shared by the entire farm and can therefore service OAuth token requests for OAuth authorization codes that were issued by any of the members of the farm.
- The server side of the ADFSOAL Protocol is available on a REST endpoint called the "OAuth [**artifact**](#gt_artifact) lookup REST endpoint" hosted by the AD FS server. The URL of this endpoint can be determined from the hostname of the AD FS server.
- The OAuth artifact lookup REST endpoint on the AD FS server is secured by using Integrated Windows Authentication and is restricted to allow access only from the AD FS server's service account. It is assumed that Integrated Windows Authentication has been established at a lower layer by using [[RFC4559]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90483) before the protocol defined in this document begins functioning.
<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The ADFSOAL Protocol was designed to support AD FS servers deployed in an [**AD FS farm with standalone artifact store**](#gt_ad-fs-farm-with-standalone-artifact-store) configuration.

The ADFSOAL Protocol is not required for stand-alone (non-farm) AD FS server deployments. It is also not required for scenarios where AD FS servers are deployed in an [**AD FS farm with shared artifact store**](#gt_ad-fs-farm-with-shared-artifact-store) configuration.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

**Supported Transports**: The ADFSOAL Protocol supports only HTTP.

**Protocol Versions**: Versioning for the ADFSOAL Protocol is defined using the mandatory "api-version" query parameter defined in section [2.2.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.1). The only supported version is "1".

**Localization**: The ADFSOAL Protocol does not return localized strings.

**Capability Negotiation**: The ADFSOAL Protocol does not support capability negotiation.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

None.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The HTTP protocol [[RFC2616]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90372) MUST be used as the transport.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Common Data Types

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 HTTP Methods

The ADFSOAL Protocol does not define any custom HTTP methods in addition to the existing set of standard HTTP methods.

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 HTTP Headers

The messages exchanged in the ADFSOAL Protocol use the following HTTP headers in addition to the existing set of standard HTTP headers.

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| client-request-id | This optional header is used to specify a request identifier that is used when logging errors or failures that occur while processing the request. |

<a id="Section_2.2.2.1"></a>
#### 2.2.2.1 client-request-id

The **client-request-id** HTTP header is optional and MAY be specified by the client role of the ADFSOAL Protocol. This header is used to provide the server role a unique request ID, which is then used by the server of the ADFSOAL Protocol to log error messages that were encountered while processing that lookup request. The value of the **client-request-id** HTTP header MUST be a [**globally unique identifier (GUID)**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) in standard string representation (see [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) section 3.1.17 (String UUID) for the format).

**Note** The **client-request-id** HTTP header and the *client-request-id* query parameter defined in section [2.2.3.2](#Section_2.2.3.2) are designed to be mutually exclusive. The client role of the ADFSOAL Protocol SHOULD use either the HTTP header or the query parameter. If both are specified, the server role of the ADFSOAL Protocol gives precedence to the *client-request-id* query parameter and ignores the value of the **client-request-id** HTTP header.

The format for the **client-request-id** HTTP header is as follows.

String = *(%x20-7E)

client-request-id = String

<a id="Section_2.2.3"></a>
### 2.2.3 Common URI Parameters

The following table summarizes the set of common query parameters defined by this specification.

| URI parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| api-version | This query parameter MUST be present and is used to specify the version of the protocol. |
| client-request-id | This query parameter is optional and is used to specify a request identifier, which is used when logging errors or failures that occur while processing the request. |

<a id="Section_2.2.3.1"></a>
#### 2.2.3.1 api-version

GET http://server/adfs/artifact/{artifactId}?api-version={version} HTTP/1.1

The *api-version* query parameter MUST be present and is used to specify the version of the protocol requested by the client of the ADFSOAL Protocol.<1>

The format of the *api-version* query parameter is as follows.

String = *(%x20-7E)

api-version = String

<a id="Section_2.2.3.2"></a>
#### 2.2.3.2 client-request-id

GET http://server/adfs/artifact/{artifactId}?api-version={version}&client-request-id={ClientRequestId} HTTP/1.1

The *client-request-id* query parameter is optional and can be specified by the client role of the ADFSOAL Protocol. This parameter is used to provide a request identifier to the server role of the ADFSOAL Protocol, which is then used by the server role of the ADFSOAL Protocol to log error messages that were encountered while processing the corresponding lookup request. The value of the *client-request-id* query parameter MUST be a [**globally unique identifier (GUID)**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) in standard string representation (see [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) section 3.1.17 (String UUID) for the format).

The format of the *client-request-id* query parameter is as follows.

String = *(%x20-7E)

client-request-id = String

<a id="Section_2.2.4"></a>
### 2.2.4 Complex Types

The following table summarizes the set of complex type definitions included in this specification.

| Complex type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AuthorizationCode | An authorization code [[RFC6749]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301486) that is issued by an AD FS server to the OAuth client that requests authorization. |
| Artifact | An object that stores information corresponding to an authorization code issued by an AD FS server. |

<a id="Section_2.2.4.1"></a>
#### 2.2.4.1 AuthorizationCode

The authorization code is a concatenated string with the following format:

issuerGuid.artifactId.signature

The authorization code contains a combination of three components with a '.' (period) delimiter:

- **issuerGuid:** A base64 URL encoded ([[RFC4648]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90487) section 5) string that contains the machine [**globally unique identifier (GUID)**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) of the AD FS server that issued this authorization code.
- **artifactId:** A base64 URL encoded string that contains the identifier of the [**artifact**](#gt_artifact) that corresponds to this authorization code. The value of the **artifactId** field MUST be unique across all artifact objects (section [2.2.4.2](#Section_2.2.4.2)) that are stored in the [**artifact store**](#gt_artifact-store) of a particular AD FS server.
- **signature:** A base64 URL encoded string that contains a signature over the **issuerGuid** and the **artifactId** fields that can be verified by the server role of the ADFSOAL Protocol.
<a id="Section_2.2.4.2"></a>
#### 2.2.4.2 Artifact

The [**artifact**](#gt_artifact) object is created by an AD FS server when it successfully processes an OAuth client's request for authorization, and is generated along with the OAuth authorization code. Before issuing an OAuth authorization code to the OAuth client, the AD FS server stores the artifact object in its [**artifact store**](#gt_artifact-store).

Subsequently, when the OAuth client requests an access token by using the authorization code as specified in [[RFC6749]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301486), the AD FS server processing the request extracts the artifact identifier from the authorization code that was presented by the OAuth client, and also determines which AD FS server issued that authorization code. If the authorization code was issued by the server processing the request, the server examines its local artifact store for an artifact object corresponding to the authorization code.

If the authorization code was issued by another AD FS server in the farm, the server processing the OAuth client's token request uses the ADFSOAL Protocol to look up the authorization code on the AD FS server that issued it. If the authorization code was found on the other AD FS server, the artifact object is returned to the calling AD FS server, that is, to the AD FS server processing the token request. After performing required validation as specified in section [3.1.5.1.1.3](#Section_3.1.5.1.1.3), the AD FS server processing the token request responds to the OAuth client with the access token contained in the artifact object.

The artifact object contains the following fields.

{

"description" : "artifact object",

"type" : "object",

"properties" :

{

"id":

{

"type":"array",

"optional":false,

"items" : { "type" : "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum":255}

},

"clientId": {"type":"string", "optional":false},

"redirectUri": {"type":"string", "optional":false},

"relyingPartyIdentifier": {"type":"string", "optional":false},

"data": {"type":"string", "optional":false}

}

}

**id:** The identifier for the artifact. This field contains the same value as the **artifactId** field of the corresponding authorization code (section [2.2.4.1](#Section_2.2.4.1)).

**clientId:** The client identifier [RFC6749] for the OAuth client that originally requested the OAuth authorization code to which this artifact corresponds.

**redirectUri:** The redirection [**URI**](#gt_uniform-resource-identifier-uri) [RFC6749] specified by the OAuth client that originally requested the OAuth authorization code to which this artifact corresponds.

**relyingPartyIdentifier:** The identifier for the relying party for which the OAuth client originally requested the OAuth authorization code to which this artifact corresponds.

**data:** Contains the access token and other auxiliary information that was issued by the AD FS server that generated the OAuth authorization code to which this artifact corresponds.

The **data** field of the artifact object is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted string that adheres to the following structure, as defined in [RFC6749] section 4.1.4.

{

"access_token": {"type":"string", "optional":false},

"token_type": {"type":"string", "optional":false},

"expires_in": {"type":"int", "optional":false},

"refresh_token": {"type":"string", "optional":true},

}

## 3.1 OAuthAuthorizationCodeLookup Client Details

The "client role" of the protocol corresponds to the AD FS server that needs to retrieve an access token, corresponding to an OAuth authorization code presented to it by the OAuth client, from the AD FS server that originally issued the authorization code. In the client role of this protocol, an AD FS server looks up the authorization code presented to it by an OAuth client and determines which AD FS server in its farm originally issued that authorization code. Thereafter, using the ADFSOAL Protocol, the AD FS server in the client role issues an HTTP **GET** request to the AD FS server in the "server role" of the ADFSOAL Protocol in order to look up the OAuth authorization code. If the request is successful, the AD FS server implementing the server role returns the corresponding access token in the HTTP **GET** response.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1.1.3"></a>
###### 3.1.5.1.1.3 Processing Details

When an AD FS server receives a request from an OAuth client to redeem an OAuth authorization code, it performs the following operations before determining whether to look up the authorization code on another AD FS server in its [**AD FS farm**](#gt_3f0970e9-ce9e-4870-b112-ec0096345442):

- It extracts the **issuerGuid** and the **artifactId** from the given authorization code. The format of the authorization code is defined in section [2.2.4.1](#Section_2.2.4.1):
- If the **issuerGuid** is null or empty or corresponds to its own machine [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid), the AD FS server does not invoke the ADFSOAL Protocol. This means that the received OAuth authorization code was originally issued by the AD FS server itself and therefore there is no need to look up the artifact identifier on another AD FS server.
- If the **issuerGuid** does not match the above criteria, the AD FS server queries [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory) (for the attributes defined in section [2.3](#Section_2.3)) to find the computer account whose **objectGUID** matches the value of the **issuerGuid** that was extracted from the received OAuth authorization code.
- If a corresponding computer account was found in Active Directory, the following steps are taken.
- The AD FS server implementing the client role of the ADFSOAL Protocol, that is, the AD FS server that received the token request from the OAuth client, determines the **dnsHostName** from the AD computer object (section 2.3). This is the AD FS server that originally issued the OAuth authorization code.
- The AD FS server implementing the client role of the ADFSOAL Protocol then issues an HTTP **GET** request to the AD FS server identified in step 1 using the protocol described by this document in order to look up the artifact identifier (**artifactId**) and retrieve a corresponding artifact. If the server was able to complete the lookup operation successfully, an artifact object is returned in the HTTP **GET** response. The format of the artifact returned in the HTTP **GET** response is documented in section [2.2.4.2](#Section_2.2.4.2) of this document.
- The contents of the data field (section 2.2.4.2) in the artifact received in the HTTP **GET** response from the AD FS server implementing the server role of the ADFSOAL Protocol is then returned to the OAuth client in accordance with the requirements of [[RFC6749]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301486) section 5.1 (Successful Response).
- If a corresponding computer account was not found in Active Directory, the AD FS server that received the token request from the OAuth client responds to the OAuth client with an invalid_grant error as specified in [RFC6749] section 5.2 (Error Response).

## 3.2 OAuthAuthorizationCodeLookup Server Details

The "server role" of the protocol corresponds to the AD FS server that receives an HTTP GET request to lookup an [**artifact**](#gt_artifact) identifier from another AD FS server in its farm. The request is authenticated by using Integrated Windows Authentication as described in section [1.5](#Section_1.5). In the server role of the ADFSOAL Protocol, the AD FS server first checks to see if the request was sent by another AD FS server in its farm. After the request is authenticated, the AD FS server in the server role of the ADFSOAL Protocol checks its [**artifact store**](#gt_artifact-store) to see if the received artifact identifier corresponds to an authorization code that was originally issued by it to an OAuth client. If the authorization code was originally issued by the AD FS server, it has a corresponding artifact stored in its artifact store. This JSON formatted artifact is then base64 URL encoded and returned in the HTTP GET response to the caller, that is, to the AD FS server that implements the client role of the ADFSOAL Protocol.

<a id="Section_3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

**Artifact Store:** An [**artifact store**](#gt_artifact-store) that is used by an AD FS server to store the artifact created when the server successfully processes an OAuth client's request for authorization. The artifact is stored for the duration of the [**artifact lifetime**](#gt_artifact-lifetime). See section [2.2.4.2](#Section_2.2.4.2) for the definition of an artifact's data structure.

<a id="Section_3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Timers

**ArtifactExpiryTimer**: Artifacts are stored in the [**artifact store**](#gt_artifact-store) for a period corresponding to the [**artifact lifetime**](#gt_artifact-lifetime). The server MUST delete artifacts older than the artifact lifetime from its **Artifact Store** ADM element. The artifact lifetime SHOULD be defined as 10 minutes and MUST be equivalent to the OAuth authorization code lifetime, as defined in [[RFC6749]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301486) section 4.1.2. This timer is used to delete artifacts older than the artifact lifetime.

<a id="Section_3.2.3"></a>
### 3.2.3 Initialization

When the protocol is first initialized, the AD FS server must have access to its **Artifact Store** ADM element, where it stores state about OAuth authorization codes issued by it for the duration of the [**artifact lifetime**](#gt_artifact-lifetime). The AD FS server stores an artifact, whose format is defined in section [2.2.4.2](#Section_2.2.4.2). The artifact identifier is used to look up and retrieve the artifact from the [**artifact store**](#gt_artifact-store). Therefore, the AD FS server MUST ensure that the artifact identifier is unique across its **Artifact Store** ADM element. Access to the **Artifact Store** ADM element must be initialized before the AD FS server services requests by using the ADFSOAL Protocol.

###### 3.2.5.1.1.1 Request Body

None.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.1.2"></a>
###### 3.2.5.1.1.2 Response Body

If an artifact corresponding to the artifact identifier that was specified in the request was found in the [**artifact store**](#gt_artifact-store) on the AD FS server implementing the server role of the ADFSOAL Protocol, the HTTP 200 status code is returned. Additionally, the response body for the **GET** response contains the JSON-formatted artifact object. The format of the JSON artifact object that is returned in the response body is defined in section [2.2.4.2](#Section_2.2.4.2) (Artifact) of this document.

If an artifact corresponding to the artifact identifier specified in the request was not found in the artifact store on the AD FS server implementing the server role of the ADFSOAL Protocol, the HTTP 404 status code is returned. The response body for the **GET** response is empty in this case.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.1.3"></a>
###### 3.2.5.1.1.3 Processing Details

When an AD FS server implementing the server role of the ADFSOAL Protocol receives an HTTP **GET** request to look up a specified artifact identifier, it implements the following processing logic:

- The AD FS server extracts the {artifactId} component from the request URL.
- The AD FS server then examines its **Artifact Store** ADM element to see if an artifact with the specified artifact identifier exists.
- **Success Response**: If the artifact was found in the **Artifact Store**, the AD FS server retrieves the corresponding access token.
- The AD FS server responds to the HTTP **GET** request with an HTTP response with the HTTP status code set to 200 ("OK").
- Additionally, the body of the HTTP response contains the JSON artifact.
- **Error Response (artifact not found)**: If the artifact was not found in the **Artifact Store**, the AD FS server responds to the HTTP **GET** request in the following manner:
- The AD FS server responds with an HTTP response with the HTTP status code set to 404 ("Not Found").
- The body of the HTTP response SHOULD contain an **ErrorDetails** object (section [2.2.5](#Section_2.2.5)) that provides the client with additional information about the error.
- **Error Response**: If the AD FS server implementing the server role of the ADFSOAL Protocol encounters an error while processing the request, it returns one of the HTTP error status codes defined in section [3.1.5](#Section_3.1.5). In addition, the body of the HTTP response SHOULD contain an **ErrorDetails** object that provides the client with additional information about the error.
<a id="Section_3.2.6"></a>
### 3.2.6 Timer Events

When the **ArtifactExpiryTimer** expires, the artifact is deleted from the **Artifact Store** ADM element because it is older than the [**artifact lifetime**](#gt_artifact-lifetime).
