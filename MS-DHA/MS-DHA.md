# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Device Health Attestation (DHA) Protocol.

The DHA protocol enables devices: to submit information about the code/programs that were loaded & executed during boot (the state the device is booted to) to a remote reporting service called Device Health Attestation Service (DHA-Service), and get an encrypted [**BLOB**](#gt_binary-large-object-blob) back that is cached on the device or made available to a MDM service provider.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_attestation"></a>
**attestation**: A process of establishing some property of a computer platform or of a [**trusted platform module (TPM)**](#gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm) key, in part through TPM cryptographic operations.

<a id="gt_attestation-certificate-aikcert"></a>
**attestation certificate (AIKCert)**: An X.509 certificate, issued by a Privacy-CA ([TCG-Cred] section 2.6), that contains the public portion of an [**Attestation Identity Key**](#gt_attestation-identity-key-aik) signed by a Privacy-CA. It states that the public key is associated with a valid TPM. See [TCG-Cred] section 3.4 for more information.

<a id="gt_attestation-identity-key-aik"></a>
**Attestation Identity Key (AIK)**: An asymmetric (public/private) key pair that can substitute for the Endorsement Key (EK) as an identity for the [**trusted platform module (TPM)**](#gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm). The private portion of an AIK can never be revealed or used outside the TPM and can only be used inside the TPM for a limited set of operations. Furthermore, it can only be used for signing, and only for limited, TPM-defined operations.

<a id="gt_binary-large-object-blob"></a>
**binary large object (BLOB)**: A discrete packet of data that is stored in a database and is treated as a sequence of uninterpreted bytes.

<a id="gt_endorsement-certificate-ekcert"></a>
**endorsement certificate (EKCert)**: An X.509 certificate issued by a platform manufacturer indicating that the [**trusted platform module (TPM)**](#gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm) with the specified endorsement key was built into a specified computer platform. See [[TCG-Cred]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301945) section 3.2 for more information.

<a id="gt_endorsement-key-ek"></a>
**endorsement key (EK)**: A Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) public and private key pair, which is created randomly on the [**trusted platform module (TPM)**](#gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm) at manufacture time and cannot be changed. The private key never leaves the TPM, while the public key is used for [**attestation**](#gt_attestation) and for encryption of sensitive data sent to the TPM. See [TCG-Cred] section 2.4 for more information.

<a id="gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http"></a>
**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: An application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the World Wide Web.

<a id="gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-secure-https"></a>
**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**: An extension of HTTP that securely encrypts and decrypts web page requests. In some older protocols, "Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Sockets Layer" is still used (Secure Sockets Layer has been deprecated). For more information, see [[SSL3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90534) and [[RFC5246]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129803).

<a id="gt_secure-sockets-layer-ssl"></a>
**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**: A security protocol that supports confidentiality and integrity of messages in client and server applications that communicate over open networks. SSL supports server and, optionally, client authentication using X.509 certificates [[X509]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90590) and [[RFC5280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131034). SSL is superseded by [**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**](#gt_transport-layer-security-tls). TLS version 1.0 is based on SSL version 3.0 [SSL3].

<a id="gt_simple-type"></a>
**simple type**: An element that can contain only text and appears as <simpleType> in an XML document or any attribute of an element. Attributes are considered simple types because they contain only text. See also complex type.

<a id="gt_tcpip"></a>
**TCP/IP**: A set of networking protocols that is widely used on the Internet and provides communications across interconnected networks of computers with diverse hardware architectures and various operating systems. It includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and routing traffic.

<a id="gt_transport-layer-security-tls"></a>
**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: A security protocol that supports confidentiality and integrity of messages in client and server applications communicating over open networks. TLS supports server and, optionally, client authentication by using X.509 certificates (as specified in [X509]). TLS is standardized in the IETF TLS working group.

<a id="gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm"></a>
**trusted platform module (TPM)**: A component of a trusted computing platform. The TPM stores keys, passwords, and digital certificates. See [[TCG-Architect]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301944) for more information.

<a id="gt_xml-namespace"></a>
**XML namespace**: A collection of names that is used to identify elements, types, and attributes in XML documents identified in a URI reference [[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453). A combination of XML namespace and local name allows XML documents to use elements, types, and attributes that have the same names but come from different sources. For more information, see [[XMLNS-2ED]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90602).

<a id="gt_xml-namespace-prefix"></a>
**XML namespace prefix**: An abbreviated form of an [**XML namespace**](#gt_xml-namespace), as described in [[XML]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90598).

<a id="gt_xml-schema"></a>
**XML schema**: A description of a type of XML document that is typically expressed in terms of constraints on the structure and content of documents of that type, in addition to the basic syntax constraints that are imposed by XML itself. An XML schema provides a view of a document type at a relatively high level of abstraction.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

Many enterprises check software state and policy compliance before allowing computers to access corporate network resources. The goal of these checks is to ensure that the operating system (OS) is properly updated, the OS configuration meets company policy, and that antivirus software is up-to-date.

The Device Health Attestation (DHA) protocol provides a way for a device to submit its policy compliance status and software status in a tamper-resistant way to a Device Health Attestation Service (DHA-Service) such that its state can later evaluated by an entity such as an MDM (mobile device management) to determine compliance status.

The following diagram describes the three components that interact in a Device Health Attestation communications.

- **DHA-Enabled Device:** that supports Trusted Platform Module (TPM) in Firmware or Discreet format.
- **Device Management Server (MDM):** initiates the Device Health Attestation flow, reviews the Device Health Attestation Report (DHA-Report), and evaluates whether the reported state is equivalent to compliance status.
- **DHA-Service**: a component that processes Device Health Attestation data, produces DHA-Report.
This document discusses only the interaction between the client and the DHA-Service.

## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The following figure illustrates the relationship of this protocol to industry-standard protocols.

The Device Health Attestation Protocol depends upon [**HTTPS**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-secure-https) [[RFC2818]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90383) and can be used only with [MS-MDM](../MS-MDM/MS-MDM.md).

![Relationship of DHA protocol to industry-standard protocols](media/image3.png)

Figure 3: Relationship of DHA protocol to industry-standard protocols

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The DHA protocol assumes the availability of the following resources:

- An HTTPS channel [[RFC2818]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90383).
- A mobile device management service.
- Devices MUST support a Trusted Module Platform (TPM) that is designed based on standards specified in [[TPM]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90547) .
<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The DHA protocol is applicable for monitoring/assessing the state into which a device is booted, and to monitor/verify if the device is booted to a secure/compliant state.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

- Supported Transports: This protocol can be implemented on top of [**TLS**](#gt_transport-layer-security-tls)/[**SSL**](#gt_secure-sockets-layer-ssl) and [**HTTPS**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-secure-https) as discussed in section [2.1](#Section_2.1).
- Protocol Versions: This is version 4.0 of the DHA protocol. It is also compatible with [**TPM**](#gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm)-devices that have standardized around versions 1.2 and 2.0 of the TPM specification. The server implementation of the Device Health Attestation Protocol supports the following client versions:
- Version 1.0: The first release of the protocol.
- Version 2.0: An update to support a Security Version Number in the Health report.
- Version 3.0: An update to support TPM 1.2 devices (which results in a TPMVersion node being added to the Health report).
- Version 4.0: An update to add support for additional security measures.

## 2.1 Transport

DHA is a client-to-server protocol that consists of an [**HTTP**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-http)- -based Web service. It supports [**TLS**](#gt_transport-layer-security-tls) over [**HTTPS**](#gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-secure-https) over [**TCP/IP**](#gt_tcpip) [[RFC2818]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90383), using the following implementation-specific<1> endpoints:

**GET**: `devicehealthattestation/gethealthcertificate/v1 devicehealthattestation/gethealthcertificate/v3 devicehealthattestation/gethealthcertificate/v4`

**VALIDATE**: `devicehealthattestation/validatehealthcertificate/v1 devicehealthattestation/validatehealthcertificate/v3 devicehealthattestation/validatehealthcertificate/v4`

The [**TPM**](#gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm)-compatible device and the DHA-Service communicate via a TLS/[**SSL**](#gt_secure-sockets-layer-ssl) protected communication channel in following format.

- Device Requests use TLS/SSL for forwarding DHA-Boot-Data to DHA-Service
- The DHA-Service Responses use TLS/SSL to forward an encrypted [**BLOB**](#gt_binary-large-object-blob) to the Device

### 2.2.1 Namespaces

This specification defines and references various [**XML namespaces**](#gt_xml-namespace) that use the mechanisms specified in [[XMLNS]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=191840). Although this specification associates a specific [**XML namespace prefix**](#gt_xml-namespace-prefix) with each XML namespace that is used, the choice of any particular XML namespace prefix is implementation-specific and not significant for interoperability.

Prefixes and XML namespaces used in this specification are as follows.

# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 DHA-Enabled Client Details

The DHA protocol enables Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions to get a Device Health Report (DHA-Report) from devices that meet the following requirements.

- Support Trusted Module Platform ([**TPM**](#gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm)) version 1.xx or 2.xx in the following formats.
- Firmware (i.e. Windows phone)
- Discrete (i.e. PC devices that have a physical TPM chip)
The [**EK**](#gt_endorsement-key-ek), [**EKCert**](#gt_endorsement-certificate-ekcert) and Windows [**Attestation Identity Key (AIK)**](#gt_attestation-identity-key-aik) and Windows [**Attestation Certificate (AIKCert)**](#gt_attestation-certificate-aikcert), as specified in [[TCG-Cred]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301945), MUST be provisioned previous to initiating the [**attestation**](#gt_attestation) protocol. The health attestation protocol can be initiated asynchronously after boot once the TPM has been provisioned (i.e. EK, EK Cert, AIK, AIK Cert are created) or it can be initiated as a part of a service request by mobile device management server. For more information about the AIK enrollment process, see [[X509]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90590).

The Device Health Report (DHA-Report) is device bound and is valid only for the current boot cycle. It will also have a time bounded lifetime to force an attestation check for long-running devices.

Following is a brief overview of the Device Health Attestation, asynchronous processing flow:

- Upon Boot the device sends information about its boot state (DHA-Boot-Data) to Device Health Attestation Service (DHA-Service)
- DHA-Service replies back with an encrypted data [**BLOB**](#gt_binary-large-object-blob) (DHA-Encrypted-Data)
- When a Device Management Server (MDM-Server) needs to get a Device Health Report (DHA-Report), it sends a request to the TPM-compatible device (that is enrolled to - managed by the MDM-Server), initiates the DHA data validation session
- The TPM-compatible device sends an alert to the Device Management Server, informs that the Device Health Validation Data (DHA-Validation-Data) is ready for pickup
- The Device Management Server sends a request to the TPM-compatible device to get the DHA-Validation-Data
- The TPM-compatible device sends the DHA-Validation-Data to Device Management Server (MDM-Server)
- The Device Management Server (MDM-Server) adds a "Nonce" to the payload, forwards the DHA-Validation-Data to DHA-Service
- The DHA-Service review the data, sends a report (DHA-Report) to the Device Management Server (MDM-Server)
![Device health attestation asynchronous processing flow](media/image4.png)

Figure 4: Device health attestation asynchronous processing flow

Following is a brief overview of the Device Health Attestation, synchronous processing flow:

- The Device Management Server (MDM-Server) sends a request to the TPM-compatible device to initiate the DHA data validation session
- The TPM-compatible device sends an alert to the Device Management Server (MDM-Server), informs that the data is not ready for pickup
- The TPM-compatible sends its boot data (DHA-Boot-Data) to the DHA-Service
- The DHA-Service sends an encrypted BLOB back to the TPM-compatible device

###### 3.2.5.1.1.3 Processing Details

The Device Management Server (MDM-Server) adds a "Nonce" to the payload, and forwards the DHA-Validation-Data to DHA-Service. The TCG log that contains health measurements is validated against the Platform Configuration Registers in the [**TPM**](#gt_trusted-platform-module-tpm) (PCR) table. A report is created.
