# 1 Introduction

[**XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP)**](#gt_xml-binary-optimized-packaging-xop), as specified in [[XML-XOP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129150), defines a method for the efficient serialization of [**XML Information Sets (XML Infosets)**](#gt_67d3e681-bbf7-490a-a175-1450635981bb) that have certain types of content. The XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP) Profile extends XOP to allow for the creation of more efficient implementations that process XML Infosets. This document, [MS-XOPP], describes the serialization rules for XML Infosets as [**MIME**](#gt_multipurpose-internet-mail-extensions-mime) Multipart/Related [**XOP packages**](#gt_xop-package) but does not specify how these XML Infosets are transmitted between network nodes.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_multipurpose-internet-mail-extensions-mime"></a>
**Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)**: A set of extensions that redefines and expands support for various types of content in email messages, as described in [[RFC2045]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90307), [[RFC2046]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90308), and [[RFC2047]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90309).

<a id="gt_soap-message"></a>
**SOAP message**: An XML document consisting of a mandatory SOAP envelope, an optional SOAP header, and a mandatory SOAP body. See [[SOAP1.2-1/2007]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94664) section 5 for more information.

<a id="gt_streaming"></a>
**streaming**: The act of processing a part of an [**XML Infoset**](#gt_67d3e681-bbf7-490a-a175-1450635981bb) without requiring that the entire [**XML Infoset**](#gt_67d3e681-bbf7-490a-a175-1450635981bb) be available.

<a id="gt_xml-information-set-infoset"></a>
**XML Information Set (Infoset)**: An abstract data set that provides a consistent set of definitions for use in specifications that refer to the information in a well-formed XML document, as described in [[XMLINFOSET]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=145519).

<a id="gt_xml-binary-optimized-packaging-xop"></a>

<a id="Section_1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Overview

The XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP) Profile provides extensions that enable more efficient implementations of [[XML-XOP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129150) to be built by requiring certain ordering of the [**Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)**](#gt_multipurpose-internet-mail-extensions-mime) [**XML Information Set (XML Infoset)**](#gt_67d3e681-bbf7-490a-a175-1450635981bb) parts in the [**XOP package**](#gt_xop-package).

<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 MIME Parts Ordering in Multipart/Related XOP Package Extension

The standard [**XOP**](#gt_xml-binary-optimized-packaging-xop) implementation, as specified in [[XML-XOP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129150) section 4.1, is not allowed to consider the ordering of [**MIME**](#gt_multipurpose-internet-mail-extensions-mime) parts to be significant to XOP processing or to the construction of the [**XOP Information Set (XOP Infoset)**](#gt_xop-information-set-xop-infoset) for MIME Multipart/Related packaging. The XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP) Profile extends the MIME Multipart/Related packaging mechanism specified in [XML-XOP] to allow for the ordering of the MIME parts, as described in section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1). These extensions enable the creation of more efficient implementations for processing an [**XML Infoset**](#gt_67d3e681-bbf7-490a-a175-1450635981bb) packaged in MIME Multipart/Related [**XOP packages**](#gt_xop-package) when [**streaming**](#gt_streaming).

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP) Profile is an extension of [[XML-XOP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129150). The extensions specified in this document [MS-XOPP] do not introduce any new protocol relationships beyond those specified in [XML-XOP] Appendix A.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

There are no prerequisites or preconditions beyond those specified in [[XML-XOP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129150) Appendix A.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The [**MIME**](#gt_multipurpose-internet-mail-extensions-mime) Parts Ordering in Multipart/Related XOP Package Extension specified in section [1.3.1](#Section_1.3.1) is applicable when an [**XOP Infoset**](#gt_xop-information-set-xop-infoset) packaged in a MIME Multipart/Related [**XOP package**](#gt_xop-package) is processed in [**streaming**](#gt_streaming) fashion.

These extensions are not applicable to XOP packaging mechanisms other than MIME and those that do not specify their own packaging mechanism.

If broad interoperability with implementations strictly compliant with [[XML-XOP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129150) is desired, these extensions might not be a suitable choice.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

There is no versioning or capability negotiation beyond that specified in [[XML-XOP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129150).

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

There are no vendor-extensible fields beyond those specified in [[XML-XOP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129150).

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

There are no standards assignments beyond those specified in [[XML-XOP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129150).

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

This specification defines only serialization rules for [**XOP packages**](#gt_xop-package) and does not define how XOP packages are transmitted on the network. As such, it does not have a transport.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

Except as specified in section [2.2.1](#Section_2.2.1), the syntax used for specifying [**MIME**](#gt_multipurpose-internet-mail-extensions-mime) Multipart/Related [**XOP packaging**](#gt_xop-package) is as specified in [[XML-XOP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129150) section 3, [XML-XOP] section 4.1, and [[RFC2387]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=95254).

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Ordering of the MIME Parts in XOP Packages

The extensions provided by the XML–binary Optimized Packaging (XOP) Profile override the following text located in [[XML-XOP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129150) section 4.1:

"Except for purposes of determining the root [**MIME**](#gt_multipurpose-internet-mail-extensions-mime) part, as specified by [[RFC2387]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=95254), ordering of MIME parts MUST NOT be considered significant to [**XOP**](#gt_xml-binary-optimized-packaging-xop) processing or to the construction of the [**XOP Infoset**](#gt_xop-information-set-xop-infoset)."

In [**streaming**](#gt_streaming) mode negotiated through a process that is out of band to this protocol, the root MIME part MUST appear first in a MIME Multipart/Related [**XOP package**](#gt_xop-package), and the subsequent MIME parts MUST appear in the order in which they appear in the corresponding [**XML Infoset**](#gt_67d3e681-bbf7-490a-a175-1450635981bb).<1>

<a id="Section_3"></a>
# 3 Protocol Details

The XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP) Profile does not introduce any new protocol roles or change any existing protocol roles that are defined in [[XML-XOP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129150).

<a id="Section_4"></a>
# 4 Protocol Examples

<a id="Section_4.1"></a>
## 4.1 MIME Multipart/Related XOP Package Ordering

The XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP) Profile does not introduce any new protocol roles or change any existing protocol roles that are defined in [[XML-XOP]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129150). Examples of how [**MIME**](#gt_multipurpose-internet-mail-extensions-mime) Multipart/Related [**XOP packages**](#gt_xop-package) are ordered are provided in [XML-XOP] section 1.2.
