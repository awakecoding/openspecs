# 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Print Virtual Channel Extension to the Remote Desktop Protocol. This protocol is used to redirect printers from a [**terminal client**](#gt_terminal-client) to the [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server). This allows the [**server**](#gt_server) access to printers physically connected to the [**client**](#gt_client) as if the devices were local to the server.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_ascii"></a>
**ASCII**: The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is an 8-bit character-encoding scheme based on the English alphabet. ASCII codes represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other devices that work with text. ASCII refers to a single 8-bit ASCII character or an array of 8-bit ASCII characters with the high bit of each character set to zero.

<a id="gt_client"></a>
**client**: A computer on which the remote procedure call (RPC) client is executing.

<a id="gt_driver-name"></a>
**driver name**: A name assigned by the vendor of a printer driver, typically this name is the same as the name of a printer model (or family) that is serviced by a particular driver.

<a id="gt_manual-printer-redirection"></a>
**manual printer redirection**: The [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) [**client**](#gt_client) redirects printers that are not installed (that is, associated with a printer driver) on the [**client**](#gt_client). For such redirection to work, the user must manually specify which printer driver to use.

<a id="gt_printer-name"></a>
**printer name**: The term [**printer name**](#gt_printer-name) is used to represent a user-assigned, arbitrary name given to a printer queue. This protocol uses the term "[**printer name**](#gt_printer-name)" to identify a given printer queue.

<a id="gt_printer-queue"></a>
**printer queue**: A collection of printer drivers and printer ports that maintains a list of print jobs to the printer.

<a id="gt_prn-file"></a>
**PRN file**: A type of file that contains a sequence of raw bytes that are understood by the printer hardware. The printer driver produces these files and sends them to the printer port for actual printing. In the case of [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) printer redirection, this stream is captured on the [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) for the redirected printers and then sent to the client hardware for printing in raw mode. The contents of this stream are opaque to the Print Virtual Channel Extension.

<a id="gt_remote-device"></a>
**remote device**: A device that is attached to a remote (or [**client**](#gt_client)) machine, in contrast to a device physically attached to a machine.

<a id="gt_server"></a>
**server**: A computer on which the remote procedure call (RPC) server is executing.

<a id="gt_terminal-client"></a>
**terminal client**: A [**client**](#gt_client) of a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server). A terminal client program that runs on the [**client**](#gt_client) machine.

<a id="gt_terminal-server"></a>
**terminal server**: A computer on which terminal services is running.

<a id="gt_unicode-string"></a>
**Unicode string**: A Unicode 8-bit string is an ordered sequence of 8-bit units, a Unicode 16-bit string is an ordered sequence of 16-bit code units, and a Unicode 32-bit string is an ordered sequence of 32-bit code units. In some cases, it could be acceptable not to terminate with a terminating null character. Unless otherwise specified, all [**Unicode strings**](#gt_unicode-string) follow the UTF-16LE encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).

<a id="gt_xml-paper-specification-xps"></a>
**XML Paper Specification (XPS)**: An XML-based document format. [**XML Paper Specification (XPS)**](#gt_xml-paper-specification-xps) specifies the set of conventions for the use of XML and other widely available technologies to describe the content and appearance of paginated documents. For more information, see [[MSFT-XMLPAPER]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90214).

<a id="gt_xps-file"></a>
**XPS file**: A type of file that contains [**XPS**](#gt_xml-paper-specification-xps) data. Such files contain all document elements as well as printer-specific rendering information.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The Print Virtual Channel Extension specifies the communication used to enable the redirection of printers between a [**terminal client**](#gt_terminal-client) and a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server). By redirecting printers from the terminal client to the terminal server, applications running on a server machine can access the [**remote devices**](#gt_remote-device) as if they were local printers.

<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 Purpose of Print Virtual Channel Extension

The Print Virtual Channel Extension enables printer redirection. It allows applications running a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) to access the printers attached to the [**terminal client**](#gt_terminal-client).

<a id="Section_1.3.2"></a>
### 1.3.2 Protocol Initialization

This protocol relies for transportation of its packets on the Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md). It describes the format of messages for printer devices. This protocol is considered initialized after at least one printer device is advertised by the client, and after the "Server Device Announce Response" message that indicates successful initialization for that device is sent by the server as illustrated in the figure in section 1.3.1 of [MS-RDPEFS].

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol relies for transportation of its packets on the Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md). This protocol extends the File System Virtual Channel Extension to enable printer redirection.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Print Virtual Channel Extension operates only after the Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) transport is fully established and a printer device is advertised by the client. This protocol describes the messages for printer devices only.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Print Virtual Channel Extension is designed to be run within the context of a Remote Desktop Protocol virtual channel established between a client and server. This protocol extension is applicable when applications running on the [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) need to access the printers physically connected to a client machine.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This protocol relies on the Print Virtual Channel to perform basic versioning and capability negotiation.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol contains no vendor-extensible fields.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

This protocol does not use any standards assignments.

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

This protocol shares messages and common data types that are specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2 of Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension. This section describes the messages and data types used by the Print Virtual Channel Extension.

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

All messages MUST be transported over an established Remote Desktop Protocol device extensions channel (as specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.1).

The static virtual channel is considered terminated if the client and server are disconnected or if there are errors in processing the packet, as described in [MS-RDPEFS] section 3.1.5.2 "Processing Packet Errors".

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

The following sections contain Print Virtual Channel Extension message syntax.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Common Data Types

Printer redirection uses common data types defined and explained in the Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension. The following are the data types that are specific to the Print Virtual Channel Extension.

<a id="Section_2.2.1.1"></a>
#### 2.2.1.1 Server Printer Cache Event (SERVER_PRINTER_CACHE_EVENT)

The Server Printer Cache Event is used to identify various [**server**](#gt_server) events associated with Printer Cached Config Data (section [3.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.1.1)) in the messages sent from the server to the [**client**](#gt_client).

```mermaid

**CachedFieldsLen (4 bytes):** A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the number of bytes in the **CachedPrinterConfigData** field.

**PnPName (variable):** A null-terminated [**Unicode string**](#gt_unicode-string). This field can be set to any valid Unicode string and MUST be ignored on receipt.

**DriverName (variable):** An array of characters. The type of characters is determined by the RDPDR_PRINTER_ANNOUNCE_FLAG_ASCII flag. If the flag is set, the **DriverName** field MUST be a null-terminated ASCII string; otherwise, it MUST be a null-terminated Unicode string. The **DriverName** field specifies the [**driver name**](#gt_driver-name) used by the client for this printer. This name is used by the terminal server to determine the appropriate matching driver for the redirected printer, which is to be used on the server.<1>

**PrinterName (variable):** The **PrinterName** field is a null-terminated Unicode string. The client MUST specify the user-assigned [**printer name**](#gt_printer-name) of the local printer in this field. This name is used by the server to generate the server-side redirected printer queue.

**CachedPrinterConfigData (variable):** A variable-length array of bytes. This field is a binary large object (BLOB) of data that describes the cached printer configuration (see section [3.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.1.1)).

<a id="Section_2.2.2.2"></a>

# 3 Protocol Details

The following sections specify protocol details, including abstract data models and message processing rules.

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Common Details

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The organization is provided to explain how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Print Virtual Channel Extension follows the abstract data model specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 3.1.1. The following abstract entities are specific to this protocol.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.1"></a>
#### 3.1.1.1 Cached Printer Config Data

Printer drivers store default printing preferences for each printer. The format of these preferences is driver-specific. For the redirected printers, when a user modifies printing preferences on the [**server**](#gt_server) side, these modified printing preferences are sent back to the [**client**](#gt_client) and are cached there. When such a printer is redirected again, this cached data is sent by the client to the server along with other printer information.

The cached configuration information SHOULD be treated as an opaque data BLOB by the client. The client SHOULD treat the printer name and data BLOB pairs as records in a database. The server sends packets to the client to add, rename, delete or update the [**printer name**](#gt_printer-name) or the data BLOB of an existing record.

<a id="Section_3.1.1.2"></a>
#### 3.1.1.2 XPS Mode

When a client redirects printers, it adds a special flag (RDPDR_PRINTER_ANNOUNCE_FLAG_XPSFORMAT) if the client can handle the XPS format for the given printer. For these printers, the server MAY<2> choose to use either the [**XPS**](#gt_xml-paper-specification-xps) format or the printer driver-specific format. The server MUST notify the client with the [DR_PRN_USING_XPS (section 2.2.2.2)](#Section_2.2.2.2) message as described in section [3.3.5.1.2](#Section_3.3.5.1.2) if it chooses to use the XPS format. When this type of message is received, the client marks the printer in XPS mode. Redirection of XPS data using the Remote Desktop Protocol: XML Paper Specification (XPS) Print Virtual Channel Extension is described in [MS-RDPEXPS](../MS-RDPEXPS/MS-RDPEXPS.md).

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

No common timers are used.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

The Print Virtual Channel Extension protocol MUST be initialized before the printer can be redirected.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1"></a>
#### 3.2.5.1 Printer Redirection Messages

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.1"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.1 Sending a Client Device List Announce Request Message

After the Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension completes its initialization, the client MUST send a DR_CORE_DEVICELIST_ANNOUNCE_REQ message to the server with information for various devices. This message is specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 2.2.2.9. The Print Virtual Channel Extension prepares the printer device information that goes into this packet. The printer-specific structure is specified in section [2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.1).

The printer redirection extension enumerates the [**printer queues**](#gt_printer-queue) and manually configured printers ([**manual printer redirection**](#gt_manual-printer-redirection)) and determines the devices to be redirected. For each printer, the client collects the following information and prepares DR_PRN_DEVICE_ANNOUNCE (section 2.2.2.1) packet. This packet contains the following:

- The name of the printer queue assigned by the user.
- The name of the printer driver assigned by the driver manufacturer.
- Various flags associated with the printer.
- Printer cache data, if this data exists. See section [3.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.1.1).
<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.2"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.2 Processing a Printer Set XPS Mode Message

This message MUST be received only for the printers that were marked with RDPDR_PRINTER_ANNOUNCE_FLAG_XPSFORMAT. When a server chooses to use an [**XPS**](#gt_xml-paper-specification-xps) driver for the redirected printer, it notifies the client using this message. The client MUST then mark the printer to be in XPS mode (see section [3.1.1.2](#Section_3.1.1.2)). When printer data arrives for these printers, it MUST be treated as an [**XPS file**](#gt_xps-file) and not a [**PRN file**](#gt_prn-file). For other printers, the I/O data MUST be treated as a PRN file.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.3"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.3 Processing an Add Printer Cachedata Message

This message is received when a [**printer queue**](#gt_printer-queue) is manually installed on the server on the client's redirected port. The name of the port is stored in the **PortDosName** field. The client SHOULD store this manual printer configuration in its persistent storage, and it MUST use this configuration to redirect the printer the next time the client connects to the same server.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.4"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.4 Processing an Update Printer Cachedata Message

This message is received when the configuration information of a redirected [**printer queue**](#gt_printer-queue) is updated on the server. The client MUST store the updated **CachedPrinterConfigData** field (see section [3.1.1.1](#Section_3.1.1.1)), and it MUST use it when redirecting the printer next time.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.5"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.5 Processing a Delete Printer Cachedata Message

This message is received when a redirected [**printer queue**](#gt_printer-queue) is deleted by the server. The client MUST delete the cached configuration data previously stored for this printer.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.6"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.6 Processing a Rename Printer Cachedata Message

This message is received when the user renames the redirected printer on the server. The client MUST modify its local cached data for this printer to reflect this change, and the client MUST rename the local [**printer queue**](#gt_printer-queue).

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.7"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.7 Processing a Create Request Message

When the server starts a print job on a redirected printer, before sending the actual printing data it sends a create request. The client MUST prepare the printer specified by the **DeviceId** field to receive the printer output.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.8"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.8 Processing a Close Request Message

When the server finishes sending a print job to a redirected printer, it sends a close request. The client MUST end the printing process initiated when the create request was made.

<a id="Section_3.2.5.1.9"></a>
##### 3.2.5.1.9 Processing a Write Request Message

Multiple write requests are received along with the printing data. These write requests are sent between create and close requests. The client MUST send the data associated with the write requests to the corresponding [**printer queue**](#gt_printer-queue). The format of this data could be either printer driver-specific (non-XPS mode) or [**XPS**](#gt_xml-paper-specification-xps) format (XPS mode).

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1"></a>
#### 3.3.5.1 Printer Redirection Messages

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.1"></a>
##### 3.3.5.1.1 Processing a Client Device List Announce Request Message

After receiving a [Client Device List Announce Request (section 2.2.2.1)](#Section_2.2.2.1), the server creates a printer queue to represent each client-side printer device. The server MUST use the appropriate driver for this redirected printer queue. The server MAY use a pseudo driver that produces XPS-format output if the RDPDR_PRINTER_ANNOUNCE_FLAG_XPSFORMAT flag is supplied for the device. If this flag is not supplied, the server MAY use the **DriverName** field specified in this message to choose the appropriate printer driver on the server. If this message contains a **CachedPrinterConfigData** field, the server MUST use the information contained to configure the instance of the printer queue. The server MAY use the **PrinterName** field specified in the message to generate the name for the redirected printer queue.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.2"></a>
##### 3.3.5.1.2 Sending a Printer Set XPS Mode Message

If the client printer supports [**XPS**](#gt_xml-paper-specification-xps) format, it indicates this support using the RDPDR_PRINTER_ANNOUNCE_FLAG_XPSFORMAT flag when redirecting this printer (see section [2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.1)). For these redirected printers, the server can choose to send print job output in XPS format.<3> If the server chooses to send print data in XPS format, the server MUST send this message to the client prior to sending any data in the Printer Write Request (section [2.2.2.9](#Section_2.2.2.9)) message.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.3"></a>
##### 3.3.5.1.3 Sending an Add Printer Cachedata Message

When a user manually installs a printer driver for the redirected port, the server collects the configuration data for such a [**printer queue**](#gt_printer-queue) and sends it to the client using this message.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.4"></a>
##### 3.3.5.1.4 Sending an Update Printer Cachedata Message

When a user modifies the configuration data, such as the printing preferences for the redirected [**printer queue**](#gt_printer-queue), the server sends this message along with the configuration data to inform the client.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.5"></a>
##### 3.3.5.1.5 Sending Delete Printer Cachedata

When a user deletes the [**printer queue**](#gt_printer-queue), the server sends this message to the client.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.6"></a>
##### 3.3.5.1.6 Sending a Rename Printer Cachedata Message

When a user manually renames the redirected [**printer queue**](#gt_printer-queue), the server sends this message to the client specifying old and new [**printer names**](#gt_printer-name).

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.7"></a>
##### 3.3.5.1.7 Sending a Printer Create Request Message

When a server application starts printing to the redirected [**printer queue**](#gt_printer-queue), the server MUST send this message to the client before sending any printer data so that the client can prepare for receiving printer data.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.8"></a>
##### 3.3.5.1.8 Sending a Printer Close Request Message

When the server application is done with a printing job, the server MUST send this message to the client.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.9"></a>
##### 3.3.5.1.9 Sending a Printer Write Request Message

As a server application prints to the redirected [**printer queue**](#gt_printer-queue), the server MUST send the printer job data to the client. A print job can be distributed over multiple write requests. This message MUST be sent only after the [DR_PRN_CREATE_RSP (section 2.2.2.10)](#Section_2.2.2.10) message is received.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.10"></a>
##### 3.3.5.1.10 Processing a Printer Create Response Message

The server MUST inspect the result of the printer create operation and abort/fail the printer operation if the create request failed.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.11"></a>
##### 3.3.5.1.11 Processing a Printer Close Response Message

The server MUST ignore this message after validating it according to the rules specified in [MS-RDPEFS](../MS-RDPEFS/MS-RDPEFS.md) section 3.1.5.2.

<a id="Section_3.3.5.1.12"></a>
##### 3.3.5.1.12 Processing a Printer Write Response Message

The server MUST inspect the amount of data written and send the next packet of data if there are any packets remaining.

# 6 Appendix A: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

- Windows 2000 operating system
- Windows XP operating system
- Windows Server 2003 operating system
- Windows Vista operating system
- Windows Server 2008 operating system
- Windows 7 operating system
- Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system
- Windows 8 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 operating system
- Windows 8.1 operating system
- Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system
- Windows 10 operating system
- Windows Server 2016 operating system
- Windows Server operating system
- Windows Server 2019 operating system
- Windows Server 2022 operating system
- Windows 11 operating system
- Windows Server 2025 operating system
Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 2.2.2.1: Applicable Windows Server releases look at the [**driver name**](#gt_driver-name) specified by the client and perform an exact string comparison to find the matching printer driver on the server. The matching printer driver might not be available on the server for various reasons. If the matching printer driver is not available, the server cannot reliably load an appropriate printer driver, and it fails to redirect the printer. This is an early design limitation, which was fixed for Windows Server 2008.

For printer redirection in applicable Windows Server releases (this is not supported in Windows Server 2003), [**XPS**](#gt_xml-paper-specification-xps)-based drivers are recommended. When a client supports the XPS format (that is, the RDPDR_PRINTER_ANNOUNCE_FLAG_XPSFORMAT flag is set in the [Client Device List Announce Request (section 2.2.2.1)](#Section_2.2.2.1) message), Windows implementations use the terminal server–specific XPS-capable printer driver and ignore the **DriverName** field.

<2> Section 3.1.1.2: XPS Mode is not supported for Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003.

<3> Section 3.3.5.1.2: Windows has the option of using XPS format or not, based on group policy that instructs the implementation to use the XPS format or a matching printer driver.
