# 1 Introduction

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Location Virtual Channel Extension (RDPEL) applies to the Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting, as defined in [MS-RDPBCGR](../MS-RDPBCGR/MS-RDPBCGR.md). RDPEL is used to remote physical location parameters such as latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, and heading from a terminal server client to a terminal server. The current physical location of the client is encoded and then sent on the wire to the server. After this location data is received and decoded by the server, it is injected into the session associated with the remote user, effectively remoting the location parameters of the client.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

## 1.3 Overview

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Location Virtual Channel Extension (RDPEL), defined in section [2.2](#Section_2.2), adds the ability to redirect the client's location (latitude, longitude and altitude) to a server so that location-based services running in a user session can provide a more contextualized experience where possible. It is used to remote physical location parameters such as latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, and heading from a terminal server client to a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server) .

An example message flow that encapsulates the protocol phases and all the location protocol messages described in section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2) is presented in the following figure.

![image1](media/image1.png)

**Figure 1: Messages exchanged by the location protocol endpoints**

The location protocol is divided into two distinct phases:

- Initializing Phase
- Running Phase
The Initializing Phase occurs at the start of the connection. During this phase, the server and client exchange the RDPLOCATION_SERVER_READY_PDU (section [2.2.2.1](#Section_2.2.2.1)) and RDPLOCATION_CLIENT_READY_PDU (section [2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2)) messages. The server initiates this exchange when the dynamic virtual channel (sections [1.4](#Section_1.4) and [2.1](#Section_2.1)) over which the location update messages will flow has been opened.

Once both endpoints are ready, the Running Phase is entered. During this phase, the client sends periodic location updates to the server encapsulated in the RDPLOCATION_BASE_LOCATION3D_PDU (section [2.2.2.3](#Section_2.2.2.3)), RDPLOCATION_LOCATION2D_DELTA_PDU (section [2.2.2.4](#Section_2.2.2.4)), and RDPLOCATION_LOCATION3D_DELTA_PDU (section [2.2.2.5](#Section_2.2.2.5)) messages. The server decodes these updates and injects them into the user's session to ensure that any location-aware applications remain in-sync with the client's current position, altitude, speed, and heading.

<a id="Section_1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Location Virtual Channel Extension is embedded in a dynamic virtual channel transport, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) sections 1 to 3.

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Location Virtual Channel Extension operates only after the dynamic virtual channel transport is fully established. If the dynamic virtual channel transport is terminated, the Remote Desktop Protocol: Location Virtual Channel Extension is also terminated. The protocol is terminated by closing the underlying virtual channel. For details about closing the dynamic virtual channel, see [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) section 3.2.5.2.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Location Virtual Channel Extension is applicable in scenarios where the location of the client device is required to provide a more relevant and contextually accurate user experience in the remote session hosted on a [**terminal server**](#gt_terminal-server).

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The Remote Desktop Protocol: Location Virtual Channel Extension is designed to operate over a dynamic virtual channel, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC](../MS-RDPEDYC/MS-RDPEDYC.md) sections 1 to 3. The dynamic virtual channel name is the null-terminated [**ANSI character**](#gt_ansi-character) string "Microsoft::Windows::RDS::Location". The usage of channel names in the context of opening a dynamic virtual channel is specified in [MS-RDPEDYC] section 2.2.2.1.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

The following sections specify the Remote Desktop Protocol: Location Virtual Channel Extension message syntax. All multiple-byte fields within a message MUST be marshaled in [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) byte order, unless otherwise specified.

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Common Data Types

<a id="Section_2.2.1.1"></a>
#### 2.2.1.1 FOUR_BYTE_SIGNED_INTEGER

The **FOUR_BYTE_SIGNED_INTEGER** structure is used to encode a value in the range -0x1FFFFFFF to 0x1FFFFFFF by using a variable number of bytes. The three most significant bits of the first byte encode the number of bytes in the structure and the sign.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-1: "c"
  2-2: "s"
  3-7: "val1"
  8-15: "val2 (optional)"
  16-23: "val3 (optional)"
  24-31: "val4 (optional)"
```

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ONE_BYTE_VAL 0 | Implies that the optional **val2**, **val3**, and **val4** fields are not present. Hence, the structure is 1 byte in size. |
| TWO_BYTE_VAL 1 | Implies that the optional **val2** field is present, while the optional **val3** and **val4** fields are not present. Hence, the structure is 2 bytes in size. |
| THREE_BYTE_VAL 2 | Implies that the optional **val2** and **val3** fields are present, while the optional **val4** field is not present. Hence, the structure is 3 bytes in size. |

#### 2.2.1.2 FOUR_BYTE_FLOAT

The **FOUR_BYTE_FLOAT** structure is used to encode a value in the range -0x3FFFFFF to 0x3FFFFFF to a precision of seven decimal places by using a variable number of bytes. The six most significant bits of the first byte encode the number of bytes in the structure, the sign and the exponent that MUST be used to reconstruct the value.

Depending on the value of the field **c**:

value = (-1 ^ s) * (val1 / (10 ^ e)) or

value = (-1 ^ s) * (((val1 << 8) + val2) / (10 ^ e)) or

value = (-1 ^ s) * (((val1 << 16) + (val2 << 8) + val3) / (10 ^ e)) or

value = (-1 ^ s) * (((val1 << 24) + (val2 << 16) + (val3 << 8) + val4) / (10 ^ e))

### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

**Note** It is possible to implement the following conceptual data by using a variety of techniques as long as the implementation produces external behavior that is consistent with that described in this document.

#### 3.1.5.1 Processing a Location Message

All location messages are prefaced by the RDPLOCATION_HEADER (section [2.2.1.3](#Section_2.2.1.3)) structure.

When a location message is processed, the **pduType** field in the header MUST first be examined to determine if the message is within the subset of expected messages as described in section [1.3](#Section_1.3). If the message is not expected, it SHOULD be ignored.

If the message is in the correct sequence, the **pduLength** field MUST be examined to make sure that it is consistent with the amount of data read from the "Microsoft::Windows::RDS::Location" dynamic virtual channel (section [2.1](#Section_2.1)). If this is not the case, the message SHOULD be ignored.

The structure and fields of the RDPLOCATION_CLIENT_READY_PDU message are specified in section [2.2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2.2).

If the client does not support location remoting, then it MUST NOT send this PDU to the server.

**latitudeDelta** = previousLatitude – currentLatitude

**longitudeDelta** = previousLongitude – currentLongitude

**speedDelta** = previousSpeed – currentSpeed

**headingDelta** = previousHeading – currentHeading

After encoding and transmitting the location data, the client MUST update the Abstract Data Model with the current latitude, longitude, speed, and heading.
