# 1 Introduction

The Device Registration Join Protocol provides a lightweight mechanism for registering personal or corporate-owned devices with a workplace.

Whereas the discovery of information needed to register devices is obtained by use of the Device Registration Discovery Protocol [MS-DVRD](../MS-DVRD/MS-DVRD.md), the Device Registration Join Protocol, defined in this specification, makes use of that information to register a device in the [**device registration service**](#gt_device-registration-service).

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_access-control-list-acl"></a>
**access control list (ACL)**: A list of access control entries (ACEs) that collectively describe the security rules for authorizing access to some resource; for example, an object or set of objects.

<a id="gt_active-directory"></a>
**Active Directory**: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses LDAP as its primary access protocol. Active Directory stores information about a variety of [**objects**](#gt_object) in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE](../MS-KILE/MS-KILE.md). Active Directory is either deployed as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), which are both described in [MS-ADOD](../MS-ADOD/MS-ADOD.md): Active Directory Protocols Overview.

<a id="gt_augmented-backus-naur-form-abnf"></a>
**Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)**: A modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), commonly used by Internet specifications. ABNF notation balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power. ABNF differs from standard BNF in its definitions and uses of naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges. For more information, see [[RFC5234]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123096).

<a id="gt_base64-encoding"></a>
**base64 encoding**: A binary-to-text encoding scheme whereby an arbitrary sequence of bytes is converted to a sequence of printable ASCII characters, as described in [[RFC4648]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90487).

<a id="gt_certificate"></a>
**certificate**: When referring to X.509v3 certificates, that information consists of a public key, a distinguished name (DN) of some entity assumed to have control over the private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate, and some number of other attributes and extensions assumed to relate to the entity thus referenced. Other forms of certificates can bind other pieces of information.

<a id="gt_certification-authority-ca"></a>
**certification authority (CA)**: A third party that issues public key certificates. Certificates serve to bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide whether to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust is to be transitive. For more information, see [[RFC3280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90414).

<a id="gt_claim"></a>
**claim**: A statement that one subject makes about itself or another subject. For example, the statement can be about a name, identity, key, group, privilege, or capability. Claims have a provider that issues them, and they are given one or more values. They are also defined by a claim value type and, possibly, associated metadata.

<a id="gt_container"></a>
**container**: An [**object**](#gt_object) in the directory that can serve as the parent for other [**objects**](#gt_object). In the absence of schema constraints, all [**objects**](#gt_object) would be [**containers**](#gt_container). The schema allows only [**objects**](#gt_object) of specific classes to be [**containers**](#gt_container).

<a id="gt_coordinated-universal-time-utc"></a>
**Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**: A high-precision atomic time standard that approximately tracks Universal Time (UT). It is the basis for legal, civil time all over the Earth. Time zones around the world are expressed as positive and negative offsets from UTC. In this role, it is also referred to as Zulu time (Z) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). In these specifications, all references to UTC refer to the time at UTC-0 (or GMT).

<a id="gt_device-registration-service"></a>
**device registration service**: A service that allows registration of computing devices on a corporate network. These devices might not be controlled by the administrator of the network.

<a id="gt_directory"></a>
**directory**: The database that stores information about objects such as users, groups, computers, printers, and the directory service that makes this information available to users and applications.

<a id="gt_distinguished-name-dn"></a>
**distinguished name (DN)**: A name that uniquely identifies an object by using the relative distinguished name (RDN) for the object, and the names of container objects and domains that contain the object. The distinguished name (DN) identifies the object and its location in a tree.

<a id="gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid"></a>
**globally unique identifier (GUID)**: A term used interchangeably with universally unique identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value. Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [[RFC4122]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90460) or [[C706]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824) have to be used for generating the GUID. See also universally unique identifier (UUID).

<a id="gt_hypertext-transfer-protocol-secure-https"></a>
**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**: An extension of HTTP that securely encrypts and decrypts web page requests. In some older protocols, "Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Sockets Layer" is still used (Secure Sockets Layer has been deprecated). For more information, see [[SSL3]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90534) and [[RFC5246]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129803).

<a id="gt_javascript-object-notation-json"></a>
**JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)**: A text-based, data interchange format that is used to transmit structured data, typically in Asynchronous JavaScript + XML (AJAX) web applications, as described in [[RFC7159]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=842522). The JSON format is based on the structure of ECMAScript (Jscript, JavaScript) objects.

<a id="gt_json-web-token-jwt"></a>
**JSON Web Token (JWT)**: A string representing a set of claims as a JSON object that is encoded in a JWS or JWE, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted. For more information, see [[RFC7519]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=824833).

<a id="gt_object"></a>
**object**: A set of attributes, each with its associated values. For more information on objects, see [MS-ADTS](../MS-ADTS/MS-ADTS.md) section 1 or [MS-DRSR](../MS-DRSR/MS-DRSR.md) section 1.

<a id="gt_object-identifier-oid"></a>
**object identifier (OID)**: In the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), a sequence of numbers in a format described by [[RFC1778]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90291). In many LDAP directory implementations, an OID is the standard internal representation of an attribute. In the directory model used in this specification, the more familiar ldapDisplayName represents an attribute.

<a id="gt_private-key"></a>
**private key**: One of a pair of keys used in public-key cryptography. The private key is kept secret and is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted with the corresponding public key. For an introduction to this concept, see [[CRYPTO]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89841) section 1.8 and [[IEEE1363]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89899) section 3.1.

<a id="gt_public-key-algorithm"></a>
**public key algorithm**: An asymmetric cipher that uses two cryptographic keys: one for encryption, the public key, and the other for decryption, the private key. In signature and verification, the roles are reversed: public key is used for verification, and private key is used for signature generation. Examples of public key algorithms are described in various standards, including Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) in FIPS 186-2 ([[FIPS186]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89869)), RSA in PKCS#1 ([[RFC8017]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2164409)), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) also published an introduction to public key technology in SP800-32 ([[SP800-32]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90524) section 5.6).

<a id="gt_public-key-cryptography-standards-pkcs"></a>
**Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)**: A group of Public Key Cryptography Standards published by RSA Laboratories.

<a id="gt_representational-state-transfer-rest"></a>
**Representational State Transfer (REST)**: A class of web services that is used to transfer domain-specific data by using HTTP, without additional messaging layers or session tracking, and returns textual data, such as XML.

<a id="gt_rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa"></a>
**Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)**: A system for public key cryptography. [**RSA**](#gt_rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa) is specified in [RFC8017].

<a id="gt_secure-sockets-layer-ssl"></a>
**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**: A security protocol that supports confidentiality and integrity of messages in client and server applications that communicate over open networks. SSL supports server and, optionally, client authentication using [**X.509**](#gt_x509) [**certificates**](#gt_certificate) [[X509]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90590) and [[RFC5280]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131034). SSL is superseded by [**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**](#gt_transport-layer-security-tls). TLS version 1.0 is based on SSL version 3.0 [SSL3].

<a id="gt_security-identifier-sid"></a>
**security identifier (SID)**: An identifier for security principals that is used to identify an account or a group. Conceptually, the [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is composed of an account authority portion (typically a domain) and a smaller integer representing an identity relative to the account authority, termed the relative identifier (RID). The [**SID**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) format is specified in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.4.2; a string representation of [**SIDs**](#gt_security-identifier-sid) is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2 and [MS-AZOD](../MS-AZOD/MS-AZOD.md) section 1.1.1.2.

<a id="gt_sha1-hash"></a>

## 1.3 Overview

The Device Registration Join Protocol provides for issuance of [**X.509v3**](#gt_x509) digital [**certificates**](#gt_certificate), and is intended for use as a lightweight device-registration server. The protocol is based loosely on [MS-DVRE](../MS-DVRE/MS-DVRE.md).

The Device Registration Join Protocol provides a single [**REST**](#gt_representational-state-transfer-rest)-based endpoint that returns [**JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)**](#gt_javascript-object-notation-json)–formatted data in the response message.

This document defines and uses the following terms:

**device registration service (DRS) server**: The server that implements the REST Web service that accepts and responds to device registration requests using the Device Registration Join Protocol.

**client**: The entity that creates and sends a request to the server using the Device Registration Join Protocol.

![Protocols related to the Device Registration Join Protocol](media/image1.png)

Figure 1: Protocols related to the Device Registration Join Protocol

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Device Registration Join Protocol issues [**X.509v3**](#gt_x509) certificates that have a corresponding relationship with a device object represented in a [**directory**](#gt_directory) server. A server implementation of the protocol requires the functionality of a [**certificate authority**](#gt_c925d5d7-a442-4ba4-9586-5f94ccec847a) and a directory server.

This protocol requires that the following state changes be made to [**Active Directory**](#gt_active-directory).

- Create an instance of the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service-Container class ([MS-ADSC](../MS-ADSC/MS-ADSC.md) section 2.139) in the directory.
- Create an instance of the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service class ([MS-ADSC] section 2.138) as a child of the container object created in the previous step with the following attributes:
- Set the ms-DS-Registration-Quota attribute ([MS-ADA2](../MS-ADA2/MS-ADA2.md) section 2.443) of the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service object to 10.
- Set the ms-DS-Maximum-Registration-Inactivity-Period attribute ([MS-ADA2] section 2.385) of the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service object to 90.
- Set the ms-DS-Is-Enabled attribute ([MS-ADA2] section 2.343) of the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service object to true.
- Set the ms-DS-Device-Location attribute ([MS-ADA2] section 2.305) of the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service object to a [**distinguished name (DN)**](#gt_distinguished-name-dn) of a [**container**](#gt_container) location in the directory. The container is of class ms-DS-Device-Container ([MS-ADSC] section 2.137).
- Generate a certificate signing certificate. The certificate and [**private key**](#gt_private-key) are stored in the ms-DS-Issuer-Certificates attribute ([MS-ADA2] section 2.351) of the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service object. For details, see section [2.3.1](#Section_2.3.1).
The public portion of the certificate is stored in the ms-DS-Issuer-Public-Certificates attribute ([MS-ADA2] section 2.352) of the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service object. For details, see section [2.3.2](#Section_2.3.2).

- Set the following directory [**access control list (ACL)**](#gt_access-control-list-acl) entries:
- Grant the server read access to the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service object.
- Grant the server read/write access to ms-DS-Device objects ([MS-ADSC] section 2.136).
<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Device Registration Join Protocol is applicable only for requests for device registration.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

None.

<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

The Device Registration Join Protocol does not include any vendor-extensible fields.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

<a id="Section_2"></a>
# 2 Messages

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The Device Registration Join Protocol consists of a single RESTful Web service.

- HTTPS [[RFC2818]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90383) over TCP/IP [[RFC2616]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90372)
The protocol operates on the following URI endpoint.

| Web service | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Device Join Service | https://<server>:<server port>/EnrollmentServer/device |

All client messages to the server MUST use [**Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Sockets Layer (HTTPS)**](#gt_9239bd88-9747-44a6-83a6-473f53f175a7) and provide server authentication, which MUST use [**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**](#gt_transport-layer-security-tls) 1.1 [[RFC4346]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90474), or greater.

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>

###### 3.1.5.1.1.3 Processing Details

The HTTP POST request is processed as follows.

- The server checks for the following claims and values in the JWT sent by the client in the HTTP Authorization Header:
| Claim | Value |
| --- | --- |
| http://schemas.microsoft.com/authorization/claims/PermitDeviceRegistrationClaim | The value MUST be the string "true". |
| http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2012/01/accounttype | The value MUST be the string "DJ". |
| http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/onpremobjectguid | A unique id generated by the client. The value MUST be binary and base64-encoded. |
| primarysid | The SID of the identity that authenticated to the Web service. |

If any of the claims from the table is not present, or if the value of the claim does NOT match the corresponding value in the table, the server MUST respond to the HTTP POST in the following manner:

- The DRS server responds with an HTTP response with the HTTP status code set to 400 ("Bad Request").
- The body of the HTTP response contains an ErrorDetails object (section [2.2.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.1)) that provides the client with additional, implementation-specific information about the error.
- The server adds the following [**object identifiers (OIDs)**](#gt_object-identifier-oid) and values to the X.509 certificate request [[RFC4211]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301568) contained in the CertificateRequest object of the client HTTP request.
| OID | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 1.2.840.113556.1.5.284.2 | The DRS server MUST generate a [**globally unique identifier (GUID)**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) and include it as the value. |

###### 3.1.5.1.2.1 Request Body

The request body MUST be empty.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1.2.2"></a>
###### 3.1.5.1.2.2 Response Body

If the DRS server successfully removes the device object from the directory, an HTTP 200 status code ("OK") is returned. If the DRS server does NOT respond to the HTTP DELETE request with the HTTP status code set to 200, the body of the HTTP response MUST contain an ErrorDetails object (section [2.2.3.1](#Section_2.2.3.1)) that provides the client with additional, implementation-specific information about the error. Otherwise, the response body MUST be empty.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1.2.3"></a>
###### 3.1.5.1.2.3 Processing Details

The HTTP DELETE request is processed as follows.

- Client authentication is established between the client and the DRS server using TLS. If authentication is NOT established, the server MUST respond to the HTTP DELETE with an HTTP response that has the HTTP status code set to 401 ("Unauthorized").
- The DRS server looks up the device object in the directory using the Alt-Security-Identities attribute of the device, where the [thumbprint]+[publickeyhash] portions of the attribute are derived from the X.509 certificate that was provided by the client in step 1. See section [2.3.3](#Section_2.3.3) for details on the format of the Alt-Security-Identities attribute. If a device object is NOT found in the directory, the DRS server responds with an HTTP response that has the HTTP status code set to 401 ("Unauthorized").
- The DRS server removes the device object from the directory. If the DRS server fails to remove the device object from the directory, the DRS server responds with an HTTP response that has the HTTP status code set to 400 ("Bad Request").

## 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

The Device Registration Join Protocol uses HTTPS as a transport. Using [**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**](#gt_secure-sockets-layer-ssl) server certificate verification ensures that the client is communicating with the real server and closes any possible man-in-the-middle attacks.

The input message uses an JSON Web Token for both authentication and authorization. The server must validate that the security token is signed by a trusted identity provider, is within the token validity period, and that the target audience of the token is the server.
