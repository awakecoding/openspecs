    title: "Fix Get-OpenSpecOpenXmlNodeText space-join bug"
    description: "The Get-OpenSpecOpenXmlNodeText function joins all <w:t> text nodes with space separators (-join ' '). Word splits text across multiple <w:r> runs at arbitrary boundaries (spell-check, formatting, revision marks), so this produces mid-word spaces like 'W EBAUTHN', '10/8/20 10', 'technica l'. Fix by joining without spaces and using xml:space attribute to determine actual whitespace."
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Table cell text no longer has spurious mid-word spaces"
      - "The specific examples identified are fixed: WEBAUTHN, 10/8/2010, technical"
      - "No regressions in body text or heading extraction"

    title: "Handle xml:space=preserve attribute on w:t elements"
    description: "Word uses xml:space='preserve' on <w:t> elements to indicate significant whitespace (leading/trailing spaces). Currently whitespace-only <w:t> nodes are skipped entirely (line 170). Fix to preserve meaningful whitespace while not adding spurious spaces at run boundaries."
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Intentional spaces between words in the same table cell are preserved"
      - "Leading/trailing whitespace in w:t elements with xml:space=preserve is respected"

      - "All TOC links use Section_X.Y format instead of _Toc format"

Add slug generation (lowercase, hyphenated) for non-numbered headings to make TOC links to them work with readable anchors."

    notes: |
      Findings from comparison:
      1. MISSING SECTION NUMBERS IN HEADINGS (High) - Live shows '2.2.1 WebAuthN_Channel Request Message', we show '### WebAuthN_Channel Request Message'. Section numbers from Word auto-numbering are not in heading text.
      2. MISSING BOLD ON FIELD NAMES (Medium) - Live shows '**command** (key type...)', we show 'command (key type...)'. Run properties (w:b) not applied.
      3. Body text content matches well after text extraction fix.
      4. Table structure and content correct - values/meanings properly separated.
      5. TOC links work correctly with Section_X.Y anchors.
      6. Cross-reference links (gt_GUID, Section_GUID) resolve correctly.
      7. External links (go.microsoft.com) preserved correctly.

    title: "Fix inline formatting boundary detection"

    notes: |
      Implemented formatting detection in ConvertFrom-OpenSpecOpenXmlInlineNode for the 'r' case.
      Uses Unicode noncharacter placeholders (U+FDD0/1/2) for safe marker merging.
      Detects: w:b (bold), w:i (italic), w:rStyle with code-like names, w:rFonts with monospace.
      Whitespace moved outside markers for CommonMark compliance.
      Adjacent same-format markers merged (including single-space separated).
      Bold stripped from headings (heading style implies bold).
      Results: 2,845 bold pairs in MS-RDPBCGR, 3 italic instances detected.

      Replaced Get-OpenSpecOpenXmlNodeText with ConvertFrom-OpenSpecOpenXmlParagraph
