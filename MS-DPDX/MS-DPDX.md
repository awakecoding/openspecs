# 1 Introduction

This specification pertains to the DirectPlay Protocol and describes how DirectPlay messages are used natively by the DXDiag application. This protocol is intended for [**peer-to-peer**](#gt_peer-to-peer) network video gaming.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_acknowledgment-ack"></a>
**acknowledgment (ACK)**: A signal passed between communicating processes or computers to signify successful receipt of a transmission as part of a communications protocol.

<a id="gt_big-endian"></a>
**big-endian**: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the most significant byte stored in the memory location with the lowest address.

<a id="gt_client"></a>
**client**: A computer on which the remote procedure call (RPC) client is executing.

<a id="gt_coalesced-payload"></a>
**coalesced payload**: A special form of payload that consists of multiple traditional payloads combined into a single packet.

<a id="gt_command-frame-cframe"></a>
**command frame (CFRAME)**: A special DirectPlay 8 control frame that does not carry application payload data. For more information, see the DirectPlay 8 Protocol: Reliable Specification ([MC-DPL8R](../MC-DPL8R/MC-DPL8R.md) section 2.2.1). See Also, [**data frame**](#gt_data-frame-dframe).

<a id="gt_crc-16-ibm-algorithm"></a>
**CRC-16-IBM algorithm**: The [**CRC-16-IBM algorithm**](#gt_crc-16-ibm-algorithm) polynomial is x^16 + x^15 + x^2 + 1. Normal and reversed representations are "0x8005" or "0xA001".

<a id="gt_cyclic-redundancy-check-crc"></a>
**cyclic redundancy check (CRC)**: An algorithm used to produce a checksum (a small, fixed number of bits) against a block of data, such as a packet of network traffic or a block of a computer file. The CRC is a broad class of functions used to detect errors after transmission or storage. A CRC is designed to catch random errors, as opposed to intentional errors. If errors might be introduced by a motivated and intelligent adversary, a cryptographic hash function has to be used instead.

<a id="gt_data-frame-dframe"></a>
**data frame (DFRAME)**: A DirectPlay 8 frame that exists in the standard connection sequence space and typically carries application payload data. The total size of the DFRAME header and payload are to be less than the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the underlying protocols and network. For more information, see the DirectPlay 8 Protocol: Reliable Specification ([MC-DPL8R] section 2.2.2). See Also, [**command frame**](#gt_command-frame-cframe).

## 1.3 Overview

The DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol is designed to handle the following two basic types of network messaging for networked gaming:

- Reliable versus not reliable messaging: This determines whether or not messages are guaranteed to be delivered to the target application in the event of packet loss.
- Sequential versus non-sequential messaging: This determines whether or not messages are received by the target application in the same order in which they are sent in the event of packet loss or incorrect ordering.
[**Games**](#gt_game) use messaging for a variety of purposes, each with different demands. To support the range of messaging requirements, the DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol designates a message as belonging to one of four categories, depending on whether the message is reliable and/or sequential. The categories are specified by setting the **PACKET_COMMAND_RELIABLE** and **PACKET_COMMAND_SEQUENTIAL** flags in the **bCommand** field of the [TRANS_USERDATA_HEADER](#Section_2.2.17) packet header as follows:

| Message category | Flags set |
| --- | --- |
| Reliable and Sequential | PACKET_COMMAND_RELIABLE and PACKET_COMMAND_SEQUENTIAL |
| Not reliable and Sequential | PACKET_COMMAND_SEQUENTIAL |
| Reliable and Non-sequential | PACKET_COMMAND_RELIABLE |
| Not reliable and Non-sequential | None |

The DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol enables optimizing of messaging strategy by assigning categories on a message-by-message basis.

Reliable packets are those that the upper layer considers important to retry when they are lost on the network. Packets not marked as reliable are for temporary messages that are not critical to operation and are not retried because they are replaced with subsequent messages. Sequential packets are those that have to be delivered according to the upper layer and have to wait until the gaps in the sequence due to packet loss are resolved. However, non-sequential packets can be delivered to the upper layer as they arrive.

<a id="Section_1.3.1"></a>
### 1.3.1 How DXDiag Uses DirectPlay

DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol packets are transported by means of [**User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**](#gt_user-datagram-protocol-udp) (as specified in [[RFC768]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90490)) and [**internetwork packet exchange**](#gt_internetwork-packet-exchange-ipx) [[IPX]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89914). To facilitate transport over unreliable serial streams, such as those provided by direct connection [**serial**](#gt_d3177233-a206-4a1c-9991-6288323da6a8) and [**modem**](#gt_1fe7e0c1-8b87-4a20-a8f2-213c70299522) links, a message format with signatures and checksums is defined in section [2.2](#Section_2.2).

Enumeration packets are used for lightweight discovery of available [**game sessions**](#gt_game-session), typically on a [**local area network (LAN)**](#gt_local-area-network-lan). The computer [**hosting**](#gt_host) a [**DXDiag**](#gt_directx-diagnostic-dxdiag) game session listens for incoming enumeration queries from a remote computer and responds with enumeration replies. Upon receiving the response, the remote computer initiates a stateful connection to the hosting computer in order to participate in the game session.

In the DXDiag game session, an array of identifiers is contained in a [**name table**](#gt_name-table). When a new [**client**](#gt_client) joins a session, the client receives a name table that lists all of the clients currently in the game session. When a client departs the game session, the identifier for that client is removed from the name table. The name table itself is kept current through the use of a version number.

The DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol is a sliding window protocol that requires the receiver to acknowledge received UDP packets before more packets are transmitted. An [**acknowledgment (ACK)**](#gt_acknowledgment-ack) can be conveyed in one of two ways: either bundled within back traffic sent from the receiver, or, when no back traffic is flowing, sent from the receiver as a dataless [**selective acknowledgment (SACK)**](#gt_selective-acknowledgment-sack) packet.

When the ACK is bundled within back traffic, fields within the header are used to indicate the sequence number of the next expected packet. This acknowledges that all packets with sequence numbers less than the specified number have been received correctly. If an ACK is not received within a specified amount of time, the original packet is resent with the same sequence number as was previously assigned.

**Note** The specified amount of time is derived from the current [**round-trip time (RTT)**](#gt_round-trip-time-rtt) measured by previously acknowledged messages. An initial RTT measurement is also taken from the [TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT](#Section_2.2.8) response to the [TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT](#Section_2.2.7) or TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT packet sent during the initial handshake.

If the original sender specifies [**poll packet (POLL)**](#gt_poll-packet-poll) (ACK now) in the packet header, the receiver immediately acknowledges the packet when it arrives.

## 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol has a dependency on [**UDP**](#gt_user-datagram-protocol-udp), or other similar datagram-oriented, connectionless protocol such as [**IPX**](#gt_internetwork-packet-exchange-ipx), for the [**transport layer**](#gt_transport-layer). As a native Windows protocol, no other protocols depend on the DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol.

![DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol relationship to other protocols](media/image1.png)

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

All multiple-byte fields used by the DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol are in [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) byte order, unless otherwise noted.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Applicability Statement

The DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol was designed for multiplayer network gaming, but not for other uses of [**peer-to-peer**](#gt_peer-to-peer) messaging. It is not recommended for file transfer or for applications with robust security requirements that cannot provide them at other layers such as Internet Protocol security [**IPsec**](#gt_internet-protocol-security-ipsec).

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This specification covers versioning issues in the following areas:

- Protocol versions: The [**DirectPlay protocol**](#gt_directplay-protocol) has the following version levels for features:
- Any version level between 0x00010000 and 0x00010004 implements the base features. The base features include all features described in this specification except for signing and [**coalescence**](#gt_coalesced-payload).
- A version level of 0x00010005 implements the base features and adds support for coalescence.
- A version level of 0x00010006 implements the base features, supports coalescence, and adds support for signing.
In the DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol, the version level value is specified in the **dwCurrentProtocolVersion** field of the [TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT](#Section_2.2.7) or [TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT](#Section_2.2.8) message.

**Note** DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol version numbers advertise the availability of coalescence and signing, but they do not mandate the usage of these features. Even when the recipient indicates support for coalescence or signing, the implementation can choose not to use these features.<1>

- Capability negotiation: The DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol inspects the value of the **dwCurrentProtocolVersion** field of the TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT and TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT messages to identify the features that are supported by the sender and receiver. In this respect, capability negotiation is provided in a manner similar to that available in the [**DirectPlay 8 Protocol**](#gt_directplay-8-protocol), as described in [MC-DPL8R](../MC-DPL8R/MC-DPL8R.md) section 1.7.
**Note** After the release of [**DirectPlay 4**](#gt_directplay-4), earlier versions of [**DirectPlay**](#gt_directplay) were modified to resolve to DirectPlay 4, as described in [MC-DPL4CS](../MC-DPL4CS/MC-DPL4CS.md). These versions include:<2>

- DirectPlay (1)
- DirectPlay 2
- DirectPlay 2A
- DirectPlay 3
- DirectPlay 3A
<a id="Section_1.8"></a>
## 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

<a id="Section_1.9"></a>
## 1.9 Standards Assignments

The DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol uses one well-known [**UDP**](#gt_user-datagram-protocol-udp) port assignment.

| Parameter | Value | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UDP port for [**DirectPlay**](#gt_directplay) | 6073/udp | [[IANAPORT]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89888) |

For the purpose and use of this port assignment, see section [3](#Section_3).

# 2 Messages

This protocol references commonly used data types as defined in [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md).

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Transport

The DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol uses [**UDP**](#gt_user-datagram-protocol-udp), [**internetwork packet exchange (IPX)**](#gt_internetwork-packet-exchange-ipx), [**serial**](#gt_d3177233-a206-4a1c-9991-6288323da6a8), or [**modem**](#gt_1fe7e0c1-8b87-4a20-a8f2-213c70299522) as the transport. The DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol can utilize either IPv4 or IPv6. The wire protocol format is the same for UDP and IPX. When a serial or modem link is used, there is an extra header, as specified in section [2.2.2](#Section_2.2.2).

<a id="Section_2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Message Syntax

<a id="Section_2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 DPNID

The DPNID identifier describes the 32-bit [**DirectPlay**](#gt_directplay) network identifier for a [**player**](#gt_player) in a [**game session**](#gt_game-session).

This type is declared as follows:

typedef DWORD DPNID, *PDPNID;

The [**DPNID**](#gt_dpnid) for each player in the game session MUST be unique. The DPNID for a player is generated in several steps while adding the player to the game session.

- The index of the entry in the [**name table**](#gt_name-table) that was used to create the player is stored in the lowest 20 bits of the DPNID. For example, when the index of the entry within the name table is 5, the index is stored as 0xNNN00005.
- Along with the index, the version of the name table that existed when the entry was created is also stored. For example, when the name table version is 10 (0x0A), the index is stored as 0x00A00005.
- This value is then XOR'd with the first 32 bits of the game session [**instance**](#gt_instance) [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid). For example, if the instance GUID begins with 0xA1B2C3D4, the DPNID 0x00A00005 value would be XOR'd with 0xA1B2C3D4 to yield 0xA112C3D1.
**Note** The [**DirectPlay host**](#gt_directplay-host) uses the DPNID of a player to determine the location for this DPNID entry in the name table.

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 _MESSAGE_HEADER

When a [**serial**](#gt_d3177233-a206-4a1c-9991-6288323da6a8) or [**modem**](#gt_1fe7e0c1-8b87-4a20-a8f2-213c70299522) link is used, any of the packets listed in the table in section [2.2.3](#Section_2.2.3) are modified by prefixing them with the _MESSAGE_HEADER header. Exceptions to this are the packets [EnumQuery (section 2.2.4)](#Section_2.2.4) and [EnumResponse (section 2.2.5)](#Section_2.2.5), which use _MESSAGE_HEADER in place of the first 32 bits of their payloads.

For example, the following figure illustrates the contents of the [TRANS_USERDATA_DESTROY_PLAYER](#Section_2.2.15) packet when prefixed with the _MESSAGE_HEADER header.

![TRANS_USERDATA_DESTROY_PLAYER packet prefixed with the _MESSAGE_HEADER header](media/image2.png)

Figure 2: TRANS_USERDATA_DESTROY_PLAYER packet prefixed with the _MESSAGE_HEADER header

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-7: "Signature"
  8-15: "MessageType"
  16-31: "wMessageSize"
  32-47: "wMessageCRC"
  48-63: "wHeaderCRC"
```

**Signature (1 byte):** An 8-bit serial signature for the packet. This MUST be set to the value 0xCC.

**MessageType (1 byte):** An 8-bit token that indicates the message type. The high 4 bits MUST be set to one of the following values.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0x20 | This message contains an enumeration response. See section 2.2.5. |
| 0x40 | This message contains a [**transport packet**](#gt_transport-packet) message following the header, and the low two bits MUST be ignored. |
| 0x60 | This message contains an enumeration query. See section 2.2.4. The low two bits of the **MessageType** value in an enumeration query MUST be echoed in the low two bits of the enumeration response (a message with **MessageType** value of "0x20"). The sender MAY use any identifier value for the enumeration query. However, the sender SHOULD use this value to correlate queries with responses to calculate the [**round-trip time (RTT)**](#gt_round-trip-time-rtt). |

**wMessageSize (2 bytes):** A 16-bit integer that specifies the size, in bytes, of the message.

**wMessageCRC (2 bytes):** A 16-bit integer that provides the [**CRC**](#gt_cyclic-redundancy-check-crc), in bytes, for the message data, which is calculated using the standardized [**CRC-16-IBM algorithm**](#gt_crc-16-ibm-algorithm).

**wHeaderCRC (2 bytes):** A 16-bit integer that provides the CRC, in bytes, for the message header, which is calculated using the standardized CRC-16-IBM algorithm.

<a id="Section_2.2.3"></a>
### 2.2.3 DXDiag DirectPlay Packets

DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol packets beginning with a zero byte are used to locate [**game sessions**](#gt_game-session) and to test network paths for [**peer**](#gt_peer) connection attempts. Packets that have a nonzero first byte are part of an actively managed connection and are further divided into command, user data, and [**ACK**](#gt_acknowledgment-ack) packet types.

A packet's purpose is determined by a combination of its command values, extended operation code values, or flag values within the packet header. For user data [**transport packets**](#gt_transport-packet), the first byte that follows the 4-byte header declares the type of information included in the packet.

The DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol uses the following packets.

| Packet | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EnumQuery](#Section_2.2.4) | Enumerates [**hosting**](#gt_host) [**servers**](#gt_server). |
| [EnumResponse](#Section_2.2.5) | Responds to an enumeration request. |
| [SESS_PATH_TEST](#Section_2.2.6) | Circumvents issues with [**network address translation (NAT)**](#gt_network-address-translation-nat) devices. |

| [TRANS_USERDATA_NAMETABLE_VERSION](#Section_2.2.23) | Specifies the version number of the [**name table**](#gt_name-table). |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_REQ_NAMETABLE_OP](#Section_2.2.24) | Instructs a client to send name table information to the host. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_ACK_NAMETABLE_OP](#Section_2.2.25) | Transmits name table information from a client to the host. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_RESYNC_VERSION](#Section_2.2.30) | Requests that the name table version number be resynchronized to the current version number. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_SEND_PLAYER_DNID](#Section_2.2.32) | Sends a user identification number to another client. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_KEEPALIVE](#Section_2.2.22) | Used by [**DXDiag**](#gt_directx-diagnostic-dxdiag) to calculate an [**RTT**](#gt_round-trip-time-rtt). |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_CONNECT_ATTEMPT_FAILED](#Section_2.2.12) | Indicates that a peer in the game session is unable to connect to a new peer. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_CONNECT_FAILED](#Section_2.2.13) | Indicates that a connection attempt failed. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_TERMINATE_SESSION](#Section_2.2.14) | Instructs a client to disconnect from the game session. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_INSTRUCTED_CONNECT_FAILED](#Section_2.2.21) | Indicates that a client was unable to carry out a server's instruction to connect to a new client. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_HOST_MIGRATE](#Section_2.2.18) | Indicates that host [**migration**](#gt_host-migration) is enabled and that the host server is terminating. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_HOST_MIGRATE_COMPLETE](#Section_2.2.19) | Informs clients that the game session-hosting responsibilities have successfully migrated from the departing host. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_ADD_PLAYER](#Section_2.2.11) | Instructs clients to add the specified client to the [**game**](#gt_game) session. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_DESTROY_PLAYER](#Section_2.2.15) | Instructs clients to remove the specified user from the name table. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_END_OF_STREAM](#Section_2.2.16) | Signals the disconnection of a user. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_REQ_INTEGRITY_CHECK](#Section_2.2.27) | Requests that a host determine if a target client is still in the game session. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_INTEGRITY_CHECK](#Section_2.2.28) | Requests that a client validate that it is still in the game session. |
| [TRANS_USERDATA_INTEGRITY_CHECK_RESPONSE](#Section_2.2.29) | Response from a client validating that it is still in the game session. |

| [TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT](#Section_2.2.7) | Requests a connection. |
| [TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT](#Section_2.2.8) | Accepts a connection request. |
| [TRANS_COMMAND_SACK](#Section_2.2.9) | Acknowledges outstanding packets. |

To reduce network traffic, several [**DirectPlay**](#gt_directplay) **TRANS_USERDATA** packets can be fused into a single packet using a special [**coalesced payload**](#gt_coalesced-payload), as defined in section [2.2.17.1](#Section_2.2.17.1). **TRANS_USERDATA** packets that have the PACKET_COMMAND_USER1 or PACKET_COMMAND_USER2 flag set in the **bCommand** field of the TRANS_USERDATA_HEADER packet header can be coalesced.

<a id="Section_2.2.4"></a>
### 2.2.4 EnumQuery

The EnumQuery packet is used to enumerate hosting [**servers**](#gt_server) [MC-DPLHP](../MC-DPLHP/MC-DPLHP.md). The server replies with an [EnumResponse](#Section_2.2.5) to the [**client**](#gt_client), where one EnumResponse message is sent for each [**game session**](#gt_game-session) that is running on the server. As a result, the client can receive multiple EnumResponse messages if more than one game session is running. The manner in which multiple available game sessions are handled, such as presenting a list to the user for selection, is left to the implementation.

**Note** When a [**serial**](#gt_d3177233-a206-4a1c-9991-6288323da6a8) or [**modem**](#gt_1fe7e0c1-8b87-4a20-a8f2-213c70299522) link is used, the [_MESSAGE_HEADER (section 2.2.2)](#Section_2.2.2) header replaces the first 32 bits of the EnumQuery payload (the **LeadByte**, **CommandByte**, and **EnumPayload** fields).

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-7: "LeadByte"
  8-15: "CommandByte"
  16-31: "EnumPayload"
  32-39: "QueryType"
  40-135: "ApplicationGUID (16 bytes, optional)"
  136-191: "ApplicationPayload (variable)"
```

**LeadByte (1 byte):** This field is 8 bits in length. It MUST be 0x00.

**Note** The first byte MUST be 0 for the message to be a valid EnumQuery message. When a message is received and the first byte is nonzero, the entire message MUST be passed through for processing as described in [MC-DPL8R](../MC-DPL8R/MC-DPL8R.md).

**CommandByte (1 byte):** This field is 8 bits in length. It MUST be 0x02.

**EnumPayload (2 bytes):** This field is 16 bits in length. The **EnumPayload** is a value selected by the sender of the EnumQuery message that MUST be echoed in the EnumResponse message. It SHOULD be used to match EnumResponse messages to their corresponding EnumQuery.

**QueryType (1 byte):** This field is 8 bits in length. The value MUST be set to one of the following.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0x01 | Indicates that this query contains an **ApplicationGUID** field. Only [**DirectPlay 8 server applications**](#gt_directplay-8-server-application) that are identified by the **ApplicationGUID** SHOULD respond to this EnumQuery. For more information about the [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) type, see [MS-DTYP](../MS-DTYP/MS-DTYP.md) section 2.3.4. Applications SHOULD NOT respond to any EnumQuery messages where the **QueryType** field is 0x01 and the **ApplicationGUID** field does not match the server application GUID. **Note** For the DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol, the value of **QueryType** SHOULD be set to "0x01". |
| 0x02 | Indicates that this EnumQuery message contains no **ApplicationGUID** field. All DirectPlay 8 server applications that receive this EnumQuery SHOULD respond to it. |

**ApplicationGUID (16 bytes):** The Application GUID. This field MUST be set to 61EF80DA-691B-4247-9ADD-1C7BED2BC13E, which is the GUID for the [**DXDiag application**](#gt_directx-diagnostic-dxdiag).

**ApplicationPayload (variable):** The DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol will never issue an application [**payload**](#gt_payload).

<a id="Section_2.2.5"></a>
### 2.2.5 EnumResponse

The EnumResponse packet is sent from the [**game session**](#gt_game-session) [**server**](#gt_server) to the [**client**](#gt_client) in response to the [EnumQuery](#Section_2.2.4) packet that was sent from the client.

**Note** When a [**serial**](#gt_d3177233-a206-4a1c-9991-6288323da6a8) or [**modem**](#gt_1fe7e0c1-8b87-4a20-a8f2-213c70299522) link is used, the [_MESSAGE_HEADER (section 2.2.2)](#Section_2.2.2) header replaces the first 32 bits of the EnumResponse payload (the **LeadByte**, **CommandByte**, and **EnumPayload** fields).

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-7: "LeadByte"
  8-15: "CommandByte"
  16-31: "EnumPayload"

  800-863: "ReservedData (variable)"
  864-927: "ApplicationReservedData (variable)"
  928-991: "ApplicationData (variable)"
```

**LeadByte (1 byte):** The leading zero byte for the packet. This field MUST be set to 0 to denote that this is a [**session packet**](#gt_session-packet).

**CommandByte (1 byte):** An 8-bit integer that indicates the command code for the message. This field MUST be set to 0x03 to denote that this is an EnumResponse message.

**EnumPayload (2 bytes):** A 16-bit integer value selected by the sender of the EnumQuery message.

An EnumResponse message is generated for every EnumQuery message received. The **EnumPayload** field in the EnumResponse message MUST match the **EnumPayload** field in the corresponding EnumQuery message.

**ReplyOffset (4 bytes):** A 32-bit integer that provides the offset in bytes from the end of **EnumPayload** to the start of the reply. If this field is 0, the packet does not contain a reply.

### 2.2.9 TRANS_COMMAND_SACK

The TRANS_COMMAND_SACK packet is used to acknowledge outstanding packets. Packet [**ACK**](#gt_acknowledgment-ack) is typically bundled in all user data packets using the **bSeq** and **bNRcv** fields found in the [TRANS_USERDATA_HEADER](#Section_2.2.17). However, the TRANS_COMMAND_SACK packet is used in the following scenarios:

- A dedicated ACK is requested (that is, when the PACKET_COMMAND_POLL bit in the **bCommand** header field is set).
- No user data remains for further bundled acknowledgments.
- The [Delayed Acknowledgment Timer (section 3.1.2.6)](#Section_3.1.2.6) elapses.

<a id="Section_2.2.17.1"></a>
#### 2.2.17.1 Coalesced Payloads

[**Coalesced payloads**](#gt_coalesced-payload) are a special form of [**payload**](#gt_payload) within standard [**DFRAMEs**](#gt_data-frame-dframe). When the **PACKET_CONTROL_COALESCE** flag is set on the outer DFRAME header **bControl** field of the [TRANS_USERDATA_HEADER](#Section_2.2.17) packet, the payload is interpreted using this format. Frames with coalesced payloads MUST have the **PACKET_COMMAND_NEW_MSG** and **PACKET_COMMAND_END_MSG** flags set on the outer DFRAME header **bCommand** field.

Between 1 and 32 two-byte headers are placed at the beginning of the buffer. The buffer MUST NOT contain more than 32 coalesce headers. If there is an odd number of coalesce headers, two extra bytes of zero padding MUST be added at the end to align the subsequent data on a 32-bit boundary. The last non-padded coalesce header MUST have the **PACKET_COMMAND_END_COALESCE** flag set in its **bCommand** field.

Following the headers are 1 to 32 payloads where the sizes of each are indicated in the corresponding headers that were added in the same order. If the payload size is not a multiple of 32 bits, and it is not the last payload in the message, one to three bytes of zero padding MUST be added to align the beginning of the next payload on a 32-bit boundary. The sizes indicated in the coalesce headers MUST NOT include any padding so as to preserve the message size as originally sent. The receiver MUST infer alignment padding when processing the payloads, and SHOULD indicate the messages to the consumer using the unpadded size.

The following is an example of a standard DFRAME for a coalesced payload.

```mermaid
packet-beta
  0-7: "bSize 1"
  8-15: "bCommand 1"
  16-23: "bSize 2 (optional)"
  24-31: "bCommand 2(optional)"
  32-39: "bSize n-1 (optional)"
  40-47: "bCommand n-1 (optional)"
  48-55: "bSize n (optional)"
  56-63: "bCommand n (optional)"
  64-95: "payload 1 (variable)"
  96-127: "payload 2 (optional, variable)"
  128-159: "payload n-1 (optional, variable)"
  160-191: "payload n (optional, variable)"
```

In the preceding example, the following field types are represented.

**bSize 1** through **bSize *n*:** The least significant 8 bits of the size of the coalesced payload. The value is combined with the optional **PACKET_COMMAND_COALESCE_BIG_1**, **PACKET_COMMAND_COALESCE_BIG_2**, and **PACKET_COMMAND_COALESCE_BIG_3** flags to determine the actual size of the payload. This MUST NOT be larger than what can fit in a standard DFRAME, including any size already used to store previous coalesce headers and payloads.

**bCommand 1** through **bCommand *n*:** The command field for the coalesced message. The **PACKET_COMMAND_USER_1** flag MUST be set. All other flags are optional.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0x01 | **PACKET_COMMAND_END_COALESCE** (Indicates that this is the final coalesced payload in the frame). |
| 0x02 | **PACKET_COMMAND_RELIABLE** (Specifies that the payload SHOULD be delivered reliably). |
| 0x04 | **PACKET_COMMAND_SEQUENTIAL** (Specifies that the payload SHOULD be indicated sequentially). |
| 0x08 | **PACKET_COMMAND_COALESCE_BIG_1** (Represents bit 9 of the coalesced payload size). |
| 0x10 | **PACKET_COMMAND_COALESCE_BIG_2** (Represents bit 10 of the coalesced payload size). |
| 0x20 | **PACKET_COMMAND_COALESCE_BIG_3** (Represents bit 11 of the coalesced payload size, which is the most significant bit). |
| 0x40 | **PACKET_COMMAND_USER_1** (Indicates that the payload is an internal session management message). |

**payload 1** through **payload *n*:** Contains the consumer payload data.

### 2.2.34 DN_ADDRESSING_URL

[**DirectPlay**](#gt_directplay) represents addresses for an application in the form of a URL. The structure of the URL is as follows:

x-directplay:/key1=value1;key2=value2;key3=value3;...

All configuration information for a provider is specified using "key=value" pairs separated by semicolons.

**Note** This is the opaque representation of a URL, where a single slash mark "/" is used as a scheme terminator, not double slash mark "//".The responsibility of data interpretation is placed on the consumer of the URL and nothing else can be assumed.

A DirectPlay URL has three components: the scheme, the scheme separator, and the URL data:

**Scheme**: The scheme used for a DirectPlay URL is "x-directplay".

**Scheme separator**: The scheme separator is simply the string ":/" (a colon followed by a slash mark), implying that the data that follows is "opaque" and does not conform to the Internet standard. It MUST NOT be "://" (a colon followed by two slash marks) because the addition of the second slash mark implies an Internet standard for the remaining data, and the DirectPlay data does not conform to the Internet standard. If the second slash mark is detected, DirectPlay will flag the URL as invalid.

**URL data**: The URL data is a combination of "key=value" strings, where each string is separated by a semicolon.

There are no ordering requirements for the "key=value" pairs in the data, except for the "provider" key that is expected to be first to speed up parsing. All "key" identifiers SHOULD be lower-case and SHOULD NOT contain characters that are considered reserved, specifically: the semicolon (;), the slash mark (/), the question mark (?), the colon (:), the at sign (@), the equals sign (=), the ampersand (&), and the number sign (#). All "value" strings will be treated as case-sensitive to cover future uses.

The following table identifies the current "keys" and their valid "values".

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| applicationinstance | Text representation of a [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid) for an application instance. |
| baud | Any valid baud rate (subject to potential validation). Used by [**modem**](#gt_1fe7e0c1-8b87-4a20-a8f2-213c70299522) and serial links. |
| device | Text representation of a device GUID. |
| flowcontrol | "NONE", "XONXOFF", "RTS", "DTR", or "RTSDTR". Used by modem and serial links. |
| hostname | Any valid hostname, used only for IP and [**Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX)**](#gt_internetwork-packet-exchange-ipx). |
| parity | "NONE", "EVEN", "ODD", "MARK", or "SPACE". Used by modem and serial links. |
| phonenumber | Any valid telephone number. Used by modem links. |
| port | Any valid port address, used for IP and IPX, up to the maximum port value of 65535. |
| program | Text representation of the program GUID. |
| provider | Text representation of the service provider GUID. |
| stopbits | "1", "1.5", or "2". Used by modem and serial links. |

**Note** Any unrecognized keys not identified in the previous table MUST be ignored. The number sign (#) token is used to indicate "user data" appended to the end of a URL. All characters that follow the number sign token in a URL MUST be ignored.

### 2.2.35 DN_ALTERNATE_ADDRESS (IPv4)

In [**DirectPlay**](#gt_directplay) 9, the **DN_ALTERNATE_ADDRESS** structure provides additional options for Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity. The alternative addresses included in **DN_ALTERNATE_ADDRESS** are supplemental to the primary address specified in the **DN_ADDRESSING_URL** structure.

In the **DN_ALTERNATE_ADDRESS** structure, the **wPort** field is derived from its conversion into a 2-byte binary value, and the **dwAddrIn** field is derived from its conversion into a 4-byte binary value. Both of these fields are treated as single binary buffers, and, therefore, are not handled in [**network byte order**](#gt_network-byte-order). For example, a port value of 2302 would be converted into its 2-byte binary value of 00001000 11111110, and an [**IPv4**](#gt_internet-protocol-version-4-ipv4) transport address of 192.168.239.061 would be converted into its 4-byte binary [IN_ADDR (IPv4) (section 2.2.35.1)](#Section_2.2.35.1) value of 11000000 10101000 11101111 00111101.

### 2.2.37 DN_NAMETABLE

The [**name table**](#gt_name-table) is a concept used by [**DirectPlay**](#gt_directplay) to keep all participants in a [**game session**](#gt_game-session) in sync with the different actions that are being performed.

The name table is really a table of [**players**](#gt_player) and [**groups**](#gt_group) that are included in the game session. Each change to the state of the table is a versioned name table operation. Any participant in the game session who applies these operations will generate a view that is consistent with every other players' name table.

**Note** Groups are not supported by the DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol.

The following table identifies the name table operations that can be performed.

| Action | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0x000000C6 | [TRANS_USERDATA_INSTRUCT_CONNECT](#Section_2.2.20) (section 2.2.20) |
| 0x000000D0 | [TRANS_USERDATA_ADD_PLAYER](#Section_2.2.11) (section 2.2.11) |
| 0x000000D1 | [TRANS_USERDATA_DESTROY_PLAYER](#Section_2.2.15) (section 2.2.15) |

The [**host**](#gt_host)/[**server**](#gt_server) is responsible for all name table operations, and all [**peers**](#gt_peer) in the game session MUST maintain their own name table copy for use in [**host migration**](#gt_host-migration). All participants MUST also preserve a record of all operations that they have performed on the name table that have incremented the version number used during host migration. Host migration is described in [MC-DPL8CS](../MC-DPL8CS/MC-DPL8CS.md) section 1.3.6.

The first operation in the name table is set to a version number of 1 and each subsequent operation increments the version by one. Every time the modulo 4 result of the new version number of the name table is equal to 0, each non-host peer SHOULD send a [TRANS_USERDATA_NAMETABLE_VERSION](#Section_2.2.23) message to the host reporting the current name table version of the peer. The host SHOULD track the versions reported by all peers and determine the oldest version number from all reports. When the oldest version number advances, the host SHOULD send a [TRANS_USERDATA_RESYNC_VERSION](#Section_2.2.30) message to all participants indicating the new oldest value. All participants SHOULD then release their records of all name table operations with versions older than this value, as they will no longer be needed during host migration.

# 3 Protocol Details

<a id="Section_3.1"></a>
## 3.1 Common Details

<a id="Section_3.1.1"></a>
### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in the DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This specification does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with what is described in this specification.

**Name Table:** The list of computer systems participating in a [**DXDiag**](#gt_directx-diagnostic-dxdiag) [**game session**](#gt_game-session) used both for local use and for transmission to enable [**peer-to-peer**](#gt_peer-to-peer) connectivity when additional participants join. This could also be considered the [**player**](#gt_player) list. It has a version number that monotonically increases with every operation that changes the [**name table**](#gt_name-table) content such as adding or removing a player.

**Name Table Entry:** The [DN_NAMETABLE_ENTRY_INFO](#Section_2.2.33.1) structure along with associated strings and data buffers for an individual participant in the DXDiag game session. These could be considered players.

**Path Test Key:** A digest of the [PATHTESTKEYDATA (section 2.2.38)](#Section_2.2.38) pseudo structure is created using the SHA-1 algorithm [[FIPS180]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89867) and is used in the [SESS_PATH_TEST (section 2.2.6)](#Section_2.2.6) message sent during the [**peer**](#gt_peer) connection process.

<a id="Section_3.1.2"></a>
### 3.1.2 Timers

<a id="Section_3.1.2.1"></a>
#### 3.1.2.1 Connect Retry Timer

The Connect Retry Timer is used to retry [TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT](#Section_2.2.7) and [TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT](#Section_2.2.8) messages if no response is received. Implementations MAY<13> retry as many times as necessary at any frequency. Recommended values are for the first retry to be 200 ms, doubling every subsequent retry with a cap at 5 seconds and 14 retries.

<a id="Section_3.1.2.2"></a>
#### 3.1.2.2 EnumQuery Retry Timer

The EnumQuery Retry Timer is used to retry [EnumQuery (section 2.2.4)](#Section_2.2.4) messages until the connection is fully established with all of the packets documented in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1) for a single-client scenario or in section [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2) for a multiple-client scenario.

The recommended frequency for retrying EnumQuery messages is every 1500 milliseconds until the connection is fully established with all of the packets documented in section 3.1.5.1 for a single-client scenario or in section 3.1.5.2 for a multiple-client scenario. The frequency can be adjusted according to application and network requirements.

<a id="Section_3.1.2.3"></a>
#### 3.1.2.3 Retry Timer

A packet is considered to be lost if one of the following occurs:

- An [**acknowledgement (ACK)**](#gt_acknowledgment-ack) is not received within a specified time-out period that is derived from the current [**round-trip time (RTT)**](#gt_round-trip-time-rtt).
- The receiver explicitly indicates, through the use of a [**SACK**](#gt_selective-acknowledgment-sack) mask, that it encountered a gap in the sequence where the packet would have been.
If a packet is lost, the implementation can resend the original packet with the same sequence number, provided the packet was marked as reliable. Otherwise, the implementation updates future packets to include a [**send mask**](#gt_send-mask) to indicate that the data is never resent if a dropped packet is not marked as reliable.

Retry Timer tracking starts when a message that is prefixed with a [TRANS_USERDATA_HEADER](#Section_2.2.17) packet header is dropped and requires a message retry or when a send mask is sent.

- For the first retry attempt, recommended values are 2.5 RTT + the delayed ACK time-out (nominally 100 ms).
- For the second and third retry attempts, it is recommended to have a linear backoff.
- For the fourth through eighth retry attempts, it is recommended to have an exponential backoff.
- In addition, it is also recommended to have an overall cap at 5 seconds and 10 retries.
<a id="Section_3.1.2.4"></a>
#### 3.1.2.4 KeepAlive Retry Timer

The KeepAlive Retry Timer sends a minimal reliable packet to keep the connection alive when no traffic has been received from a [**peer**](#gt_peer) for a specified time interval. The recommended time for inactivity is 25 seconds, and the granularity on the timer is four seconds. The interval time can be modified according to application and network requirements.

This timer SHOULD start immediately after the successful completion of a Keep Alive exchange as documented in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1) for a single-client scenario or in section [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2) for a multiple-client scenario.

When a particular peer is marked as disconnected, the timer SHOULD be stopped for that peer.

<a id="Section_3.1.2.5"></a>
#### 3.1.2.5 Path Test Retry Timer

The Path Test Retry Timer periodically resends [SESS_PATH_TEST (section 2.2.6)](#Section_2.2.6) messages to compensate for potential packet loss. The recommended time interval to retry is 375 milliseconds with a maximum of seven attempts. However, the attempts can be modified according to application and network requirements.

<a id="Section_3.1.2.6"></a>
#### 3.1.2.6 Delayed Acknowledgment Timer

The Delayed Acknowledgment Timer reduces the frequency of dedicated acknowledgments ([**SACKs**](#gt_selective-acknowledgment-sack)).This timer is used to reduce the frequency of dedicated acknowledgments ([**ACKs**](#gt_acknowledgment-ack)) so that they can be piggybacked onto return traffic or multiple receives.

The recommended value for the Delayed Acknowledgment Timer is 20 milliseconds when acknowledging out-of-order or duplicate packets. This value can be modified according to application and network requirements.

<a id="Section_3.1.3"></a>
### 3.1.3 Initialization

To use the [SESS_PATH_TEST (section 2.2.6)](#Section_2.2.6) message, the new [**client**](#gt_client) and the existing client MUST fill in a [PATHTESTKEYDATA (section 2.2.38)](#Section_2.2.38) pseudo-structure with the following:

- The **dpnidSender** field MUST be set to the [**DPNID**](#gt_dpnid) of the new [**peer**](#gt_peer) in [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) byte order.
- The **dpnidTarget** field MUST be set to the DPNID of the existing peer in little-endian byte order.
- The **guidApplication** field MUST be set to the application [**GUID**](#gt_globally-unique-identifier-guid).
- The **guidInstance** field MUST be set to the [**game session**](#gt_game-session) [**instance**](#gt_instance) GUID.
Both the new and existing clients MUST generate an SHA-1 digest of the PATHTESTKEYDATA binary data, as specified in [[FIPS180]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89867), and use the first 64 bits of the output value as the Path Test key value key. For an existing client, this value MUST remain associated with the connection attempt that the client is performing until one of the following conditions is met:

- The attempt fails.
- A valid reply packet is received from the target address.
- The client receives a valid SESS_PATH_TEST message.
At the same time, the existing client MUST prepare to accept SESS_PATH_TEST messages in response to its instructed connection messages.

For a new client, this value MUST be used in the periodic transmission of SESS_PATH_TEST messages. The [Path Test Retry Timer (section 3.1.2.5)](#Section_3.1.2.5) MUST be initialized.

<a id="Section_3.1.4"></a>
### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

<a id="Section_3.1.4.1"></a>
#### 3.1.4.1 Sending a Chat Message

To send a chat message, a participant SHOULD send a [TRANS_USERDATA_SEND_MESSAGE](#Section_2.2.31) to the other participant. The [TRANS_USERDATA_HEADER](#Section_2.2.17) for the message SHOULD indicate that it is sequential and not reliable, that is, it SHOULD have the **PACKET_COMMAND_SEQUENTIAL** flag set, and SHOULD NOT have the **PACKET_COMMAND_RELIABLE** flag set in the **bCommand** field.

<a id="Section_3.1.4.2"></a>
#### 3.1.4.2 Disconnecting

When a participant requests to disconnect, the upper layer SHOULD initiate the sequence defined in section [3.1.5.3](#Section_3.1.5.3).

<a id="Section_3.1.5"></a>
### 3.1.5 Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The [**DXDiag**](#gt_directx-diagnostic-dxdiag) application allows a [**client**](#gt_client) and [**server**](#gt_server) to create a chat session. All TRANS_USERDATA packets have their TRANS_USERDATA_HEADERs processed as specified in sections [3.1.5.8](#Section_3.1.5.8) and [3.1.5.9](#Section_3.1.5.9).

<a id="Section_3.1.5.1"></a>

- If a matching key is found and the connect attempt has not yet initiated to the intended target source address and port, the connect target SHOULD be modified to use the source address and port of the SESS_PATH_TEST packet.
- If no connect attempt is associated with a matching key value, the existing peer MUST ignore the SESS_PATH_TEST packet.
- If the recipient is the new client or the [**host**](#gt_host), and therefore not intending to make any connection attempts, the SESS_PATH_TEST packet MUST be ignored.
- The new client sends a [TRANS_USERDATA_ACK_SESSION_INFO](#Section_2.2.10) to acknowledge the [**game**](#gt_game) session information previously received from the server.
- The server sends a TRANS_USERDATA_INSTRUCT_CONNECT packet to all clients (both existing and the new client) to instruct them to connect.
- If an existing client cannot connect to the new client, the existing client responds with a [TRANS_USERDATA_INSTRUCTED_CONNECT_FAILED](#Section_2.2.21) user data packet, and the connection attempt to the new client is canceled.
- The server sends a [TRANS_USERDATA_CONNECT_ATTEMPT_FAILED](#Section_2.2.12) packet to the new client.
- The server then sends a [TRANS_USERDATA_DESTROY_PLAYER](#Section_2.2.15) packet to the existing client, instructing the existing client to remove the new client from the [**name table**](#gt_name-table).
- Otherwise, each client initiates the connection with the new client using a TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT packet.
- The new client responds with a TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT packet.
- Each existing client acknowledges the connection with a TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT packet.
- The new client and each existing client exchange TRANS_USERDATA_KEEPALIVE packets, and the existing client transmits its user identifier in a [TRANS_USERDATA_SEND_PLAYER_DNID](#Section_2.2.32) packet to the new client.
- Finally, all clients acknowledge the [**game session**](#gt_game-session) server and each other using [TRANS_COMMAND_SACK](#Section_2.2.9) packets. The processing rules for the TRANS_COMMAND_SACK packet are specified in section 3.1.5.1.
<a id="Section_3.1.5.3"></a>
#### 3.1.5.3 Client Disconnects from Chat Session

When a [**client**](#gt_client) disconnects, the [**server**](#gt_server) makes an announcement to remaining clients, and then the departing client disconnects.

- The departing client issues a [TRANS_USERDATA_END_OF_STREAM](#Section_2.2.16) packet to the server and the other existing clients in the chat session. A TRANS_USERDATA_END_OF_STREAM message SHOULD be a separate packet without a [**payload**](#gt_payload); however, it MAY be the final queued data packet. After sending the TRANS_USERDATA_END_OF_STREAM message, the departing client MUST NOT send additional [**DFRAMEs**](#gt_data-frame-dframe) other than retries. The client MUST be prepared to continue receiving [TRANS_COMMAND_SACK](#Section_2.2.9) packets until it receives the TRANS_USERDATA_END_OF_STREAM from the server and other existing clients in the [**DXDiag**](#gt_directx-diagnostic-dxdiag) chat session.
- The server and each existing client respond with four TRANS_COMMAND_SACK packets and a TRANS_USERDATA_END_OF_STREAM packet (in any order).
- The departing client returns four TRANS_COMMAND_SACK packets to the server and each existing client before disconnecting.
- If other clients are present in the [**game session**](#gt_game-session), the server sends each one a [TRANS_USERDATA_DESTROY_PLAYER](#Section_2.2.15) packet to remove the departing client from their [**name table**](#gt_name-table). This can happen before the server receives the final TRANS_COMMAND_SACK packet from the departing client.
- Each remaining client sends the server a [TRANS_USERDATA_REQ_INTEGRITY_CHECK](#Section_2.2.27) and TRANS_COMMAND_SACK packet to [**acknowledge**](#gt_acknowledgment-ack) the removal of the departed client.
<a id="Section_3.1.5.4"></a>
#### 3.1.5.4 Server Disconnects from Chat Session

A [**server**](#gt_server) can leave without destroying the chat session. The DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol allows [**hosting**](#gt_host) to [**migrate**](#gt_host-migration) to another member currently in the [**game session**](#gt_game-session).<14>

- The hosting migration begins with the server sending a [TRANS_USERDATA_END_OF_STREAM](#Section_2.2.16) packet to all [**clients**](#gt_client) in the game session.
- Each client responds with four [TRANS_COMMAND_SACK](#Section_2.2.9) packets and a TRANS_USERDATA_END_OF_STREAM packet (in any order).
- The server sends four TRANS_COMMAND_SACK packets to each client, and disconnects.
- If other clients are present in the game session, the client that has been in the game session the longest becomes the new server and contacts each client with a [TRANS_USERDATA_HOST_MIGRATE](#Section_2.2.18) user data packet.
- Each client sends a [TRANS_USERDATA_NAMETABLE_VERSION](#Section_2.2.23) user data packet to the new server.
- If the [**name table**](#gt_name-table) of any client is older than the name table of the new server, the new server ends the migration sequence for that client with [TRANS_USERDATA_HOST_MIGRATE_COMPLETE](#Section_2.2.19) and [TRANS_USERDATA_DESTROY_PLAYER](#Section_2.2.15) packets, in any order. The TRANS_USERDATA_DESTROY_PLAYER packet identifies the previous host to remove from the client game session list.
- Otherwise, if the new server determines that there is a client with a newer name table, the new server will request entries from the client with the newer name table that are not contained within the name table of the host, using the [TRANS_USERDATA_REQ_NAMETABLE_OP](#Section_2.2.24) packet.
- The client responds to the host with a [TRANS_USERDATA_ACK_NAMETABLE_OP](#Section_2.2.25) packet containing the missing entries.
- The new server sends a [TRANS_USERDATA_RESYNC_VERSION](#Section_2.2.30) packet to all clients to get every participant in sync.
- The server sends a TRANS_USERDATA_HOST_MIGRATE_COMPLETE packet to all connected [**peers**](#gt_peer).
<a id="Section_3.1.5.5"></a>
#### 3.1.5.5 Client Is Forcefully Removed from Session

A [**server**](#gt_server) can purposefully remove a [**client**](#gt_client) from the [**game session**](#gt_game-session).

- The server issues a [TRANS_USERDATA_TERMINATE_SESSION (section 2.2.14)](#Section_2.2.14) packet to the client being removed.
- The client receiving the TRANS_USERDATA_TERMINATE_SESSION MUST disconnect all connections and leave the game session.
- The client responds with a [TRANS_USERDATA_END_OF_STREAM (section 2.2.16)](#Section_2.2.16) packet to the server and any other clients that are present.
- The server and other clients send four [TRANS_COMMAND_SACK (section 2.2.9)](#Section_2.2.9) packets and one TRANS_USERDATA_END_OF_STREAM packet in any order to the client.
- The departing client returns four TRANS_COMMAND_SACK packets to the server and any other clients that are present.
- The server issues a [TRANS_USERDATA_DESTROY_PLAYER (section 2.2.15)](#Section_2.2.15) packet to the remaining connected clients indicating the removal of the disconnecting client.
<a id="Section_3.1.5.6"></a>
#### 3.1.5.6 Client Detects Loss of Connection to Other Client

A [**client**](#gt_client) can detect the loss of connection to another client (departing client) in the [**game session**](#gt_game-session).

- The client that detected the loss of connection sends a [TRANS_USERDATA_REQ_INTEGRITY_CHECK (section 2.2.27)](#Section_2.2.27) packet to the [**server**](#gt_server) to request that the server determine whether the departing client is still in the game session.
- The server sends a [TRANS_USERDATA_INTEGRITY_CHECK (section 2.2.28)](#Section_2.2.28) packet to the departing client containing the [**DPNID**](#gt_dpnid) of the client that detected the loss of connection.
- If the departing client does not respond in time to the TRANS_USERDATA_INTEGRITY_CHECK packet, the server sends the [TRANS_USERDATA_DESTROY_PLAYER (section 2.2.15)](#Section_2.2.15) packet to the client that detected the loss of connection, asking it to remove the departing client entry from its [**name table**](#gt_name-table).
- If the departing client responds to the server with a [TRANS_USERDATA_INTEGRITY_CHECK_RESPONSE (section 2.2.29)](#Section_2.2.29) packet, the server sends a [TRANS_USERDATA_TERMINATE_SESSION (section 2.2.14)](#Section_2.2.14) packet to the client that detected the loss of connection.
- The client that detected the loss of connection removes itself from the session by sending a [TRANS_USERDATA_END_OF_STREAM (section 2.2.16)](#Section_2.2.16) packet to the server.
- The server sends four [TRANS_COMMAND_SACK (section 2.2.9)](#Section_2.2.9) packets and one TRANS_USERDATA_END_OF_STREAM packet in any order to the client that detected the loss of connection.
- The client that detected the loss of connection replies with four TRANS_COMMAND_SACK packets.
- The server notifies the departing client of the removal of the client that detected the loss of connection by sending TRANS_USERDATA_DESTROY_PLAYER to the departing client.
<a id="Section_3.1.5.7"></a>
#### 3.1.5.7 Participant Receives Chat Message

When a participant receives a chat message, it can display the chat message to the user. It SHOULD send a [TRANS_COMMAND_SACK](#Section_2.2.9) message to [**acknowledge**](#gt_acknowledgment-ack) the packet sequence number in which the chat message was delivered.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.8"></a>
#### 3.1.5.8 Command Byte (bCommand) Validation and Processing

Validation and processing of the **bCommand** field of the [TRANS_USERDATA_HEADER (section 2.2.17)](#Section_2.2.17) message is as follows:

- If the User2 flag is set, the receiver SHOULD NOT process this message as a DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol session management message. The receiver MUST acknowledge this message.
- If the User2 and [**DFRAME**](#gt_data-frame-dframe) flags are not set, the receiver SHOULD NOT process the message as a DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol session management message. The message SHOULD be ignored by the receiver.
- If the User1 and User2 flags are not set and the DFRAME flag is set, the message will be considered as valid and will not be processed as a DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol session management message. The recipient SHOULD [**acknowledge**](#gt_acknowledgment-ack) this message.
- If the User1 and DFRAME flags are set and the User2 flag is not set, and if either or both the NEW_MSG and END_MSG bits are not set, the packet will be considered as valid and message processing SHOULD NOT be started for this packet. The recipient SHOULD acknowledge this packet.
- The [**POLL**](#gt_poll-packet-poll), SEQ, and REL bits SHOULD be set in session management messages.
<a id="Section_3.1.5.9"></a>
#### 3.1.5.9 Control Byte (bControl) Validation and Processing

Validation and processing of the **bControl** field of the [TRANS_USERDATA_HEADER (section 2.2.17)](#Section_2.2.17) message is as follows:

- If the Keep Alive flag is set and if the same message contains a [**payload**](#gt_payload), the receiver SHOULD ignore the payload and SHOULD process the packet as a Keep Alive message.
- If the End Of Stream flag is set and if the same message contains a payload, the receiver SHOULD ignore the End Of Stream flag and SHOULD process the payload.
- If any of the SACK1, SACK2, SEND1, or SEND2 mask bits are set and if there is no corresponding DWORD in the header, the receiver SHOULD ignore this message.
<a id="Section_3.1.5.10"></a>
#### 3.1.5.10 Send Sequence ID (bSeq) Validation and Processing

The [TRANS_USERDATA_HEADER](#Section_2.2.17) **bSeq** field MUST be either the next [**sequence ID**](#gt_sequence-id) expected or within 63 packets beyond the ID expected by the receiver. If the sequence ID is not within this range, the [**payload**](#gt_payload) MUST be ignored. In addition, a [**SACK**](#gt_selective-acknowledgment-sack) packet SHOULD be sent indicating the expected sequence ID. If the **PACKET_COMMAND_POLL** flag is set in the **bCommand** field, this packet SHOULD be sent immediately; otherwise, the [Delayed Acknowledgment Timer](#Section_3.1.2.6) SHOULD be set using a short timeout, and a SACK packet SHOULD be sent when it expires. The recommended short timeout is 20 milliseconds. This value can be modified according to application and network requirements.

If the sequence ID is the next expected, the receiver SHOULD process the payload and advance the expected sequence ID. If the sequence ID is out of order, but still within 63 packets, the receiver SHOULD queue the payload until it receives either:

- A delayed or retried transmission of the missing packet or packets, and can now process the sequence in order.
- A subsequent packet with a send mask indicating that the missing packet or packets did not use **PACKET_COMMAND_RELIABLE** and will never be retried. Therefore, the receiver advances its sequence as if it had already received and processed the packets.
If an implementation has out-of-order packets beyond the current expected sequence ID queued, it SHOULD indicate this to the sender using appropriate SACK masks on any outgoing [TRANS_COMMAND_SACK](#Section_2.2.9) or TRANS_USERDATA_HEADER based messages. This feedback enables the sender to avoid retrying packets that have already been successfully received.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.11"></a>
#### 3.1.5.11 Acknowledged Sequence ID (bNRcv) Processing

If the [TRANS_USERDATA_HEADER](#Section_2.2.17) **bSeq** [**sequence ID**](#gt_sequence-id) is valid, the **bNRcv** field SHOULD be inspected. All previously sent TRANS_USERDATA_HEADER packets that are covered by the **bNRcv** sequence ID, that is, those packets that had been sent with **bSeq** values less than **bNRcv** (accounting for 8-bit counter wrapping) are [**acknowledged**](#gt_acknowledgment-ack). These packets do not have to be remembered any longer, and their retry timers can be canceled.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.12"></a>
#### 3.1.5.12 SACK Mask Processing

When one or both of the optional [**SACK**](#gt_selective-acknowledgment-sack) mask 32-bit fields is present, and one or more bits are set in the fields, the sender is indicating that it received a packet or packets out of order, presumably due to packet loss. The two 32-bit, [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) fields MUST be considered as one 64-bit field, where **dwSACKMask1** is the low 32 bits and **dwSACKMask2** is the high 32 bits. If either 32-bit field is not available, the entire contents of the 64-bit field MUST be considered as all 0.

The receiver of a SACK mask SHOULD loop through each bit of the combined 64-bit value in the ascending order of significance. Each bit corresponds to a sequence ID after **bNRcv**. If the bit is set, it indicates that the corresponding packet was received out of order

The receiver of a SACK mask SHOULD shorten the retry timer for the first frame of the window to speed recovery from the packet loss. The recommended duration is 10 milliseconds. This value can be modified according to application and network requirements. The receiver MAY also choose to remove the selectively [**acknowledged**](#gt_acknowledgment-ack) packets from its list to retry.

<a id="Section_3.1.5.13"></a>
#### 3.1.5.13 Send Mask Processing

When one or both of the optional [**send mask**](#gt_send-mask) 32-bit fields is present, and one or more bits are set in the fields, the sender is indicating that it sent a packet or packets that were not marked as reliable and did not receive an acknowledgement yet. The two 32-bit, [**little-endian**](#gt_little-endian) fields MUST be considered as one 64-bit field, where **dwSendMask1** is the low 32 bits and **dwSendMask2** is the high 32 bits. If either 32-bit field is not available, the entire contents of the 64-bit field MUST be considered as all 0.

The receiver of a send mask SHOULD loop through each bit of the combined 64-bit value from the least significant bit to the most significant in little-endian byte order. Each bit corresponds to a [**sequence ID**](#gt_sequence-id) prior to **bSeq**, and if that is the bit that is set, it indicates that the corresponding packet was not sent reliably and will not be retried. If the recipient of the send mask had not received the packet and had not already processed a send mask that identified the sequence ID, it SHOULD consider the packet as dropped and release its placeholder in the sequence. That is, any sequential messages that could not be indicated because of the gap in the sequence where the packet that was not marked as reliable had been SHOULD now be reported to the upper layer.

<a id="Section_3.1.6"></a>
### 3.1.6 Timer Events

<a id="Section_3.1.6.1"></a>
#### 3.1.6.1 Connect Retry Timer

When the connect retry timer expires, a new [TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT](#Section_2.2.7) or [TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT](#Section_2.2.8) message SHOULD be sent, depending on the current state. The connect retry timer SHOULD then be rescheduled for the next period. It is recommended that the retry period start at 200 ms, doubling every time with a maximum of 5 seconds and 14 retries.

If the maximum number of retries has already been attempted when the timer expires, the connection attempt SHOULD be considered as failed. If the connection was initiated from an inbound TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT packet arriving on a listening computer system, the listener MAY choose to go back to listening if it did not allow additional connection attempts while the failed attempt was in progress.

<a id="Section_3.1.6.2"></a>
#### 3.1.6.2 EnumQuery Retry Timer

When the EnumQuery Retry Timer expires, a new [EnumQuery](#Section_2.2.4) message SHOULD be sent. The EnumQuery Retry Timer SHOULD be rescheduled for the next period.

<a id="Section_3.1.6.3"></a>
#### 3.1.6.3 Retry Timer

When the retry timer elapses without having been canceled, and the associated packet was marked as reliable, the [TRANS_USERDATA_HEADER](#Section_2.2.17) prefixed message SHOULD be resent, and the retry timer SHOULD then be scheduled for the next period. It is recommended that the retry period start at 2.5 [**RTT**](#gt_round-trip-time-rtt) + 100 ms and that there be linear backoff for the second and third retries, exponential backoff for subsequent retries 4 through 8, and an overall cap at 5 seconds and 10 retries.

If the maximum number of retries has already been attempted when the timer expires, the connection SHOULD be considered as lost. All other in-progress sends SHOULD be discarded, and the upper layer SHOULD be informed of the disconnection.

When the retry timer elapses without having been canceled, and the associated packet was not marked as reliable, the packet's [**sequence ID**](#gt_sequence-id) SHOULD be remembered as requiring a [**send mask**](#gt_send-mask) to be used in future transmissions.

<a id="Section_3.1.6.4"></a>
#### 3.1.6.4 KeepAlive Retry Timer

A successfully validated [**SACK**](#gt_selective-acknowledgment-sack) packet SHOULD count as a valid receive and therefore, restart the KeepAlive Retry Timer as described in section [3.1.2.4](#Section_3.1.2.4).

All successfully validated [**DFRAME**](#gt_data-frame-dframe) packets SHOULD count as valid receives and therefore, restart the KeepAlive Retry Timer as described in section 3.1.2.4.

<a id="Section_3.1.6.5"></a>
#### 3.1.6.5 Path Test Retry Timer

When the Path Test Retry Timer elapses, the new [**client**](#gt_client) MUST send a new [SESS_PATH_TEST](#Section_2.2.6) message to the source address and port of the existing client for which it is expecting a connection. This message MUST be sent from the same [**UDP**](#gt_user-datagram-protocol-udp) port number on which it is expecting the connection. If fewer than the maximum number of attempts have been made, the timer MUST then be rescheduled so that it MAY elapse again. Otherwise, the retries have been exhausted and the Path Test operation SHOULD be canceled.

<a id="Section_3.1.6.6"></a>
#### 3.1.6.6 Delayed Acknowledgment Timer

When the Delayed Acknowledgment ([**SACK**](#gt_selective-acknowledgment-sack)) Timer expires without having been canceled, the computer SHOULD send a dedicated SACK message that contains the current connection state information.

This MAY be the broadcast address to discover [**local area network (LAN)**](#gt_local-area-network-lan) [**DXDiag**](#gt_directx-diagnostic-dxdiag) game sessions.

A higher layer presents a list of discovered game sessions to the user for selection, or it MAY automatically select a discovered game session. The higher layer will then initiate a connection attempt to the specified game session. The client SHOULD initiate the sequence identified in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1) or [3.1.5.2](#Section_3.1.5.2).

<a id="Section_3.3.5"></a>
### 3.3.5 Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

# 4 Protocol Examples

<a id="Section_4.1"></a>
## 4.1 User Joins a DXDiag Chat Session Example

The following example describes how [**clients**](#gt_client) connect to a [**DXDiag**](#gt_directx-diagnostic-dxdiag) chat session.

- In the DXDiag application, the user selects the [**DirectPlay**](#gt_directplay) test option on the Network tab.
- The user selects the Network Provider, and then clicks Join Session.
- The DXDiag application goes through the steps listed in section [3.1.5.1](#Section_3.1.5.1).
<a id="Section_4.2"></a>
## 4.2 Client Disconnects from a DXDiag Chat Session Example

The following example describes how [**clients**](#gt_client) and [**servers**](#gt_server) disconnect from a [**DXDiag**](#gt_directx-diagnostic-dxdiag) chat session.

- User selects **CLOSE** on the **Chat** window. This is the same action regardless of whether the user is the server or the client in the [**game session**](#gt_game-session). However, the sequence of events that results differs according to the current role of the participant, as specified in sections [3.1.5.3](#Section_3.1.5.3) and [3.1.5.4](#Section_3.1.5.4).
<a id="Section_4.3"></a>
## 4.3 New Client Joins a Game Session with an Existing Client Example

The following example demonstrates the message sequence when a new [**client**](#gt_client) joins a DirectPlay [**game session**](#gt_game-session) that has an existing client.

![Sequence diagram for a new client joining a game session with an existing client](media/image3.png)

Figure 3: Sequence diagram for a new client joining a game session with an existing client

**Note** In the diagram, different line styles are used to distinguish between message types, including query/response, TRANS_COMMAND, TRANS_USERDATA, and SESS_PATH_TEST.

The steps in the message sequence are as follows:

- A new client sends an [EnumQuery](#Section_2.2.4) message to search for a DirectPlay game session.
**Note** EnumQuery messages are unreliable, and therefore, are at risk of being lost. In addition, it is possible to send multiple EnumQuery messages. In this example, it is assumed that the first EnumQuery message is lost and the second EnumQuery message is successfully received by the [**server**](#gt_server).

- In response to the EnumQuery message, the server sends an [EnumResponse](#Section_2.2.5) message and echoes the **EnumPayload** field as part of the response.
- The connection handshake is started by the new client sending a [TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT](#Section_2.2.7) packet to the server. The **bMsgId** field is reflected in the **bRspId** field of the [TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT](#Section_2.2.8) packet to correlate the response.
- The server responds by sending a TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT packet to the new client and echoes the **bMsgID** field of the TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT packet in the **bRspID** field.
- The new client sends a TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT packet to acknowledge the connection. It echoes the **bMsgId** field of the TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT packet from the server in the **bRspId** field of the acknowledged packet.
- The new client and the server then exchange [TRANS_USERDATA_KEEPALIVE](#Section_2.2.22) packets to indicate the successful connection handshake.
- The new client sends its information to the server using the [TRANS_USERDATA_PLAYER_CONNECT_INFO](#Section_2.2.26) packet.
- The server sends the game session information to the new client using the [TRANS_USERDATA_SEND_SESSION_INFO](#Section_2.2.33) packet, and informs the existing client about the newly joining client using the [TRANS_USERDATA_ADD_PLAYER](#Section_2.2.11) packet.
- The new client tests the presence of a network path to the existing client by sending the [SESS_PATH_TEST](#Section_2.2.6) packet.
- The new client acknowledges the game session information sent by the server by sending the [TRANS_USERDATA_ACK_SESSION_INFO](#Section_2.2.10) packet.
- The server instructs the existing client to connect to the new client by sending the [TRANS_USERDATA_INSTRUCT_CONNECT](#Section_2.2.20) packet.
- The server also sends the TRANS_USERDATA_INSTRUCT_CONNECT packet to the new client to cause the new client to resynchronize its [**name table**](#gt_name-table).
- The existing client validates the [**DPNID**](#gt_dpnid) of the new client that was sent in the TRANS_USERDATA_INSTRUCT_CONNECT packet using the **dpnid** field sent in the TRANS_USERDATA_ADD_PLAYER packet. After successful validation of the DPNID, the existing client starts connecting to the new client by sending the TRANS_COMMAND CONNECT packet.
- The new client accepts the connection request from the existing client by sending the TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT packet.
- The existing client acknowledges the connection to the new client by sending the TRANS_COMMAND_CONNECT_ACCEPT packet.
- The new client and the existing client exchange the TRANS_USERDATA_KEEPALIVE packet to indicate successful connection handshake.
- The existing client sends its DPNID value in a [TRANS_USERDATA_SEND_PLAYER_DNID](#Section_2.2.32) packet to the new client.
- The new client and the existing client acknowledge the connection by exchanging [TRANS_COMMAND_SACK](#Section_2.2.9) packets between themselves and with the server.

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base (KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.7: When a DirectPlay DXDiag Usage Protocol receiver indicates support for [**coalescence**](#gt_coalesced-payload) (version level 0x00010005 or higher), a Windows sender can utilize the coalescence feature to fuse any TRANS_USERDATA message except [TRANS_USERDATA_END_OF_STREAM](#Section_2.2.16), [TRANS_USERDATA_KEEPALIVE](#Section_2.2.22), and [TRANS_USERDATA_SEND_MESSAGE](#Section_2.2.31). Windows implementations never utilize the signing feature (version level 0x00010006), even when the receiver indicates support for signing.

<2> Section 1.7: After the release of [**DirectX**](#gt_directx) 6.0, [**DirectPlay**](#gt_directplay) versions (1) through 3A were modified to resolve to [**DirectPlay 4**](#gt_directplay-4). However, DirectPlay versions (1) through 3A were last released in Windows 98 operating system Second Edition.

<3> Section 2.2.5: Only the DPNSESSION_MIGRATE_HOST (0x00000004) value is used in the Windows implementation of the **ApplicationDescFlags** field.

<5> Section 2.2.7: In Windows operating systems without the DirectX 9 or later [**runtime**](#gt_1eeeaa67-fac3-4efc-859c-d30928efc6c0) installed, report versions less than 0x00010005, and do not support signing or coalescence.

<6> Section 2.2.8: In Windows operating systems without the DirectX 9 or later runtime installed, report versions less than 0x00010005, and do not support signing or coalescence.

<7> Section 2.2.11: Only the 0x00000100 value is used in the Windows implementation of the **dwFlags** field.

<8> Section 2.2.11: The **dwDNETClientVersion** field is set to one of the following values. Windows will send only 0x00000007 (DirectX 9.0) as the DirectX version number. Downgrading the DirectX version is not supported.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000001 | DirectX 8.0 |
| 0x00000002 | DirectX 8.1 |
