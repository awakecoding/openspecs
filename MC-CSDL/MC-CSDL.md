# 1 Introduction

The conceptual schema definition file format provides the structure and semantics of the conceptual schema definition language (CSDL) for the Entity Data Model (EDM). CSDL is a language based on XML that can be used for defining EDM-based conceptual models.

The EDM is an entity-relationship (ER) model. The ER model has existed for more than 30 years and differs from the more familiar relational model, because associations and entities are all first-class concepts.

The EDM defines some well-known primitive types, such as Edm.String, that are used as the building blocks for structural types such as entity types and complex types.

Entities are instances of entity types (for example, customer or employee) that are richly structured records with a key. The structure of an entity type is provided by its properties. An entity key is formed from a subset of the properties of the entity type. The entity key (for example, CustomerId or EmployeeId) is a fundamental concept that is used to uniquely identify and persist entity instances and to allow entity instances to participate in relationships or associations.

Entities are grouped in entity sets; for example, the entity set customers is a set of customer instances.

Associations (occasionally referred to as relationships) are instances of association types. Association types are used to specify a named relationship between two entity types. Thus, an association is a named relationship between two or more entities. Associations are grouped into association sets.

Entity types may include one or more navigation properties. A navigation property is tied to an association type and allows the navigation from one end of an association--the entity type that declares the navigation property--to the other related end, which can be anything from 0 or more related entities. Unlike standard properties, navigation properties are not considered to be structurally part of an entity.

Complex types, which are structural types similar to an entity type, are also supported by the EDM. The main difference is that complex types have no identity and cannot support associations. For these reasons, complex types instances only exist as properties of entity types (or other complex types).

The EDM also supports entity type and complex type inheritance.

Inheritance is a fundamental modeling concept that allows different types to be related in an "Is a" relationship that makes it possible to extend and reuse existing entity types and complex types. When type B inherits from type A, type A is the base-type of B, and B is a sub-type or derived-type of A. The derived-type inherits all the properties of its base-type; these properties are called inherited-properties. The derived-type can be extended to have more properties; these additional properties are called direct-properties. A direct-property name has to be unique; it cannot be the same as an inherited-property name. All valid derived-type instances at all times are also valid base-type instances and can be substituted for the parent instance. In the EDM a derived entity type always inherits the definition of its entity key from its base type.

Function imports are also supported by the EDM. A function import is conceptually similar to a method declaration in a header file, in that a function import defines a function signature, but includes no definition. The parameters and return type of the function import are one of the EDM's built-in primitive types, one of the structural types defined in the rest of the model, or a collection of primitive types and structural types.

Entity sets, association sets, and function imports are grouped into one or more entity containers. Entity containers are conceptually similar to databases; however, because entity types, association types, and complex types are declared outside of an entity container, entity types, association types, and complex types can be re-used across entity containers.

An example of a model that is defined by using CSDL is shown in section [3](#Section_3).

Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

<a id="Section_1.1"></a>
## 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

<a id="gt_adonet-entity-framework"></a>
**ADO.NET Entity Framework**: A set of technologies that enables developers to create data access applications by programming against the conceptual application model instead of programming directly against a relational storage schema.

<a id="gt_alias"></a>
**alias**: A simple identifier that is typically used as a short name for a [**namespace**](#gt_namespace).

<a id="gt_alias-qualified-name"></a>
**alias qualified name**: A qualified name that is used to refer to a structural type, with the exception of a namespace that is replaced by the namespace's [**alias**](#gt_alias). For example, if an entity type called "Person" is defined in the "Model.Store" namespace, and if that namespace's alias is "Self", the alias qualified name for the "Person" entity type is "Self.Person" rather than "Model.Store.Person".

<a id="gt_annotation"></a>
**annotation**: Any custom, application-specific extension that is applied to an instance of a schema definition language through the use of custom attributes and elements that are not a part of that schema definition language.

<a id="gt_association"></a>
**association**: A named independent relationship between two entity type definitions. Associations in the [**Entity Data Model (EDM)**](#gt_entity-data-model-edm) are first-class concepts and are always bidirectional. Indeed, the first-class nature of associations helps distinguish the [**EDM**](#gt_entity-data-model-edm) from the relational model. Every association includes exactly two association ends.

<a id="gt_cardinality"></a>
**cardinality**: The measure of the number of elements in a set.

<a id="gt_collection"></a>
**collection**: A grouping of one or more [**EDM types**](#gt_edm-type) that are type compatible.

<a id="gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl"></a>
**conceptual schema definition language (CSDL)**: A language that is based on XML and that can be used to define conceptual models that are based on the [**Entity Data Model (EDM)**](#gt_entity-data-model-edm).

<a id="gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl-document"></a>
**conceptual schema definition language (CSDL) document**: A document that contains a conceptual model that is described by using the [**CSDL**](#gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl) code.

<a id="gt_declared-property"></a>
**declared property**: A property that is statically declared by a Property element as part of the definition of a structural type. For example, in the context of an EntityType, a declared property includes all properties of an EntityType that are represented by the Property child elements of the EntityType element that defines the EntityType.

<a id="gt_derived-type"></a>
**derived type**: A type that is derived from the BaseType. Only ComplexType and EntityType can define a BaseType.

<a id="gt_dynamic-property"></a>
**dynamic property**: A designation for an instance of an OpenEntityType that includes additional nullable properties (of a scalar type or ComplexType) beyond its [**declared properties**](#gt_declared-property). The set of additional properties, and the type of each, may vary between instances of the same OpenEntityType. Such additional properties are referred to as dynamic properties and do not have a representation in a [**CSDL document**](#gt_bae7ed93-a390-4017-9d1a-8a3da753ed40).

<a id="gt_edm-type"></a>
**EDM type**: A categorization that includes the following types: [**association**](#gt_association), ComplexType, EDMSimpleType, EntityType, and enumeration.

<a id="gt_entity"></a>
**entity**: An instance of an EntityType element that has a unique identity and an independent existence. An entity is an operational unit of consistency.

<a id="gt_entity-data-model-edm"></a>
**Entity Data Model (EDM)**: A set of concepts that describes the structure of data, regardless of its stored form.

<a id="gt_enumeration-type"></a>
**enumeration type**: A type that represents a custom enumeration that is declared by using the EnumType element.

<a id="gt_facet"></a>
**facet**: An element that provides information that specializes the usage of a type. For example, the precision (that is, accuracy) [**facet**](#gt_facet) can be used to define the precision of a DateTime property.

<a id="gt_identifier"></a>
**identifier**: A string value that is used to uniquely identify a component of the [**CSDL**](#gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl) and that is of type SimpleIdentifier.

<a id="gt_in-scope"></a>
**in scope**: A designation that is applied to an XML construct that is visible or can be referenced, assuming that all other applicable rules are satisfied. Types that are in scope include all [**scalar types**](#gt_scalar-type) and structural types that are defined in [**namespaces**](#gt_namespace) that are in scope. [**Namespaces**](#gt_namespace) that are in scope include the [**namespace**](#gt_namespace) of the current [**schema**](#gt_schema) and other [**namespaces**](#gt_namespace) that are referenced in the current [**schema**](#gt_schema) by using the Using element.

<a id="gt_namespace"></a>
**namespace**: A name that is defined on the [**schema**](#gt_schema) and that is subsequently used to prefix [**identifiers**](#gt_identifier) to form the [**namespace qualified name**](#gt_namespace-qualified-name) of a structural type.

<a id="gt_namespace-qualified-name"></a>
**namespace qualified name**: A qualified name that refers to a structural type by using the name of the [**namespace**](#gt_namespace), followed by a period, followed by the name of the structural type.

<a id="gt_nominal-type"></a>
**nominal type**: A designation that applies to the types that can be referenced. Nominal types include all primitive types and named EDM types. Nominal types are frequently used inline with collection in the following format: collection(nominal_type).

<a id="gt_scalar-type"></a>
**scalar type**: A designation that applies to all EDMSimpleType and [**enumeration types**](#gt_enumeration-type). Scalar types do not include structural types.

<a id="gt_schema"></a>
**schema**: A container that defines a [**namespace**](#gt_namespace) that describes the scope of [**EDM types**](#gt_edm-type). All [**EDM types**](#gt_edm-type) are contained within some [**namespace**](#gt_namespace).

<a id="gt_schema-level-named-element"></a>
**schema level named element**: An element that is a child element of the [**schema**](#gt_schema) and contains a Name attribute that must have a unique value.

<a id="gt_value-term"></a>
**value term**: A term with a single property in EDM.

<a id="gt_vocabulary"></a>
**vocabulary**: A schema that contains definitions of [**value terms**](#gt_value-term) and entity type terms.

<a id="gt_xml-namespace"></a>
**XML namespace**: A collection of names that is used to identify elements, types, and attributes in XML documents identified in a URI reference [[RFC3986]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90453). A combination of XML namespace and local name allows XML documents to use elements, types, and attributes that have the same names but come from different sources. For more information, see [[XMLNS-2ED]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90602).

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [[RFC2119]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90317). All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## 1.3 Overview

The [**conceptual schema definition language (CSDL)**](#gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl) is an XML-based file format that describes the [**Entity Data Model (EDM)**](#gt_entity-data-model-edm). CSDL is based on standards defined in [[XML1.0]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90599) and [[XMLSCHEMA1]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90608). The root of the CSDL is a [Schema](#Section_2.1.1) element. Following that root, these child elements are supported: [Using](#Section_2.1.13), [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2), [ComplexType](#Section_2.1.7), [Association](#Section_2.1.8), and [EntityContainer](#Section_2.1.14). In CSDL 2.0 and CSDL 3.0, **Schema** elements can have [Function](#Section_2.1.15) as a child element. **EntityContainer** elements conceptually represent a **DataSource** and can contain [EntitySet](#Section_2.1.18), [AssociationSet](#Section_2.1.19), and [FunctionImport](#Section_2.1.15) as child elements. In CSDL 3.0, **Schema** elements can have [ValueTerm](#Section_2.1.31) and [Annotations](#Section_2.1.35) as child elements.

Conceptually, a CSDL file has an overall structure that resembles the following schema.

<Schema>

<Using/>

<Using/>

<Annotations />

<ValueTerm />

<EntityType/>

<EntityType/>

<ComplexType/>

<Association/>

<Association/>

<Function/>

<Function/>

<EntityContainer>

<EntitySet/>

<EntitySet/>

<AssociationSet/>

<AssociationSet/>

<FunctionImport/>

</EntityContainer>

<EntityContainer/>

</Schema>

## 1.4 Relationship to Protocols and Other Structures

Both Entity Data Model for Data Services Packaging Format [MC-EDMX](../MC-EDMX/MC-EDMX.md) and Open Data Protocol [MS-ODATA](../MS-ODATA/MS-ODATA.md) use the structures defined in [**conceptual schema definition language (CSDL)**](#gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl).

<a id="Section_1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Applicability Statement

The [**conceptual schema definition language (CSDL)**](#gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl) is an XML format that describes the structure and semantics of the [**Entity Data Model (EDM)**](#gt_entity-data-model-edm) [**schemas**](#gt_schema). All [**identifiers**](#gt_identifier), such as names, [**namespaces**](#gt_namespace), and so on, are case sensitive.

EDM is a specification for defining conceptual data models. Applications can use the EDM to define a conceptual model that describes the [**entity**](#gt_entity), relationships, and sets required in the domain served by the application.

<a id="Section_1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Versioning and Localization

This document describes the following [**conceptual schema definition language (CSDL)**](#gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl) versions: CSDL 1.0, CSDL 1.1, CSDL 1.2, CSDL 2.0, and CSDL 3.0. Aspects of later CSDL versions that do not apply to earlier versions are identified in the text.

<a id="Section_1.7"></a>
## 1.7 Vendor-Extensible Fields

The [**conceptual schema definition language (CSDL)**](#gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl) supports application-specific customization and extension through the use of [**annotations**](#gt_annotation). These annotations allow applications to embed application-specific or vendor-specific information into CSDL. The CSDL format does not specify how to process these custom-defined structures or how to distinguish structures from multiple vendors or layers. Parsers of the CSDL can ignore annotations that are not expected or not understood.

Annotations can be of two types: **AnnotationAttribute** and **AnnotationElement**.

An **AnnotationAttribute** is a custom XML attribute applied to a CSDL element. The attribute can belong to any [**XML namespace**](#gt_xml-namespace) (as defined in [[XMLNS-2ED]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90602)) that is not in the list of reserved XML namespaces for CSDL. Consult the reference for each CSDL element within this document to determine whether **AnnotationAttribute** can be used for that element.

The reserved XML namespaces for CSDL are:

http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2006/04/edm

http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/05/edm

http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2008/01/edm

# 2 Structures

<a id="Section_2.1"></a>
## 2.1 Elements

<a id="Section_2.1.1"></a>
### 2.1.1 Schema

The **Schema** element is the top-level [**conceptual schema definition language (CSDL)**](#gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl) construct that allows creation of a [**namespace**](#gt_namespace).

The contents of a namespace can be defined by one or more **Schema** instances. The [**identifiers**](#gt_identifier) that are used to name types are unique within a **Namespace**. For instance, an [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2) cannot have the same name as a [ComplexType](#Section_2.1.7) within the same namespace. The **Namespace** forms a part of the type's fully qualified name.

The following is an example of the **Schema** element:

<Schema Alias="Model" Namespace="Test.Simple.Model"

xmlns:edm="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2009/11/edm"

xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2009/11/edm">

The following rules apply to the **Schema** element.

- The [**CSDL document**](#gt_bae7ed93-a390-4017-9d1a-8a3da753ed40) MUST have the **Schema** element as its root element.
- The **Namespace** attribute is defined for each **Schema** element. **Namespace** is of type [QualifiedName](#Section_2.2.5). A namespace is a logical grouping of EntityType elements, ComplexType elements, and [Association](#Section_2.1.8) elements.
- A [**schema**](#gt_schema) **Namespace** attribute cannot use the values "System", "Transient", or "Edm".
- A schema definition can span across more than one CSDL document.
- The **Alias** attribute can be defined on a **Schema** element. **Alias** is of the type **SimpleIdentifier**.
- **Schema** can contain any number of [AnnotationAttribute](#Section_2.2.7) attributes. The full names of the **AnnotationAttribute** attributes cannot collide.
- **Schema** can contain zero or more of the following child elements. The elements can appear in any given order.
- [Using](#Section_2.1.13)
- Association
- ComplexType
- EntityType
- [EntityContainer](#Section_2.1.14)
- In CSDL 2.0 and CSDL 3.0, **Schema** can contain zero or more of the following child elements.
- **Function**
- **Schema** can contain any number of **AnnotationElement** elements.
- In CSDL 3.0, **Schema** can contain any number of **Annotations** elements.
- In CSDL 3.0, **Schema** can contain any number of **ValueTerm** elements.
- **AnnotationElement** elements MUST appear only after all other child elements of **Schema**.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the Schema element.](media/image1.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated. For all child elements within a given choice, the child elements can be ordered arbitrarily.

<a id="Section_2.1.2"></a>
### 2.1.2 EntityType

An [**entity**](#gt_entity) is an instance of an **EntityType** element. An **EntityType** has a unique identity, an independent existence, and forms the operational unit of consistency. **EntityType** elements model the top-level concepts within a data model--such as customers, orders, suppliers, and so on (to take the example of a typical line-of-business system). An entity instance represents one particular instance of the **EntityType**, such as a specific customer or a specific order. An **EntityType** can be either abstract or concrete. An abstract **EntityType** cannot be instantiated.

An **EntityType** has a **Name** attribute, a payload consisting of one or more [**declared properties**](#gt_declared-property), and an entity [Key (section 2.1.5)](#Section_2.1.5) element that specifies the set of properties whose values uniquely identify an entity within an entity set. An EntityType can have one or more properties of the specified scalar type or ComplexType. A property can be a declared property or a [**dynamic property**](#gt_dynamic-property).

In CSDL 1.2, CSDL 2.0, and CSDL 3.0, an **EntityType** can be an **OpenEntityType**. An **EntityType** is indicated to be an **OpenEntityType** by the presence of an [OpenType](#Section_2.2.8)="true" attribute. If an **EntityType** is an **OpenEntityType**, the set of properties that are associated with the **EntityType** can, in addition to declared properties, include dynamic properties.

**Note** In CSDL, dynamic properties are defined for use only with **OpenEntityType** instances.

The type of a [Property](#Section_2.1.3) in an **EntityType** can be a [**scalar type**](#gt_scalar-type) or **ComplexType**. **EntityType** can be categorized as an [**EDM type**](#gt_edm-type).

The following is an example of an **EntityType**.

<EntityType Name="Customer">

<Key>

<PropertyRef Name="CustomerId" />

</Key>

<Property Name="CustomerId" Type="Int32" Nullable="false" />

<Property Name="FirstName" Type="String" Nullable="true" />

<Property Name="LastName" Type="String" Nullable="true" />

<Property Name="AccountNumber" Type="Int32" Nullable="true" />

<NavigationProperty Name="Orders" Relationship="Model1.CustomerOrder" FromRole="Customer" ToRole="Order" />

</EntityType>

The following rules apply to the **EntityType** element:

- **EntityType** MUST have a **Name** attribute defined. The **Name** attribute is of type **SimpleIdentifier** and represents the name of this **EntityType**.
- An **EntityType** is a [**schema level named element**](#gt_schema-level-named-element) and has a unique name.
- **EntityType** can derive from a **BaseType**, which is used to specify the parent type of a [**derived type**](#gt_derived-type). The derived type inherits properties from the parent type.
- If a **BaseType** is defined, it has a [**namespace qualified name**](#gt_namespace-qualified-name) or an [**alias qualified name**](#gt_alias-qualified-name) of an **EntityType** that is in scope.
- An **EntityType** cannot introduce an inheritance cycle via the **BaseType** attribute.
- An **EntityType** can have its **Abstract** attribute set to "true". By default, the **Abstract** attribute is set to "false".
- An **EntityType** can contain any number of [AnnotationAttribute](#Section_2.2.7) attributes, but their full names cannot collide.
- An **EntityType** element can contain at most one [Documentation](#Section_2.1.21) element.
- An **EntityType** either defines an entity **Key** element or derive from a **BaseType**. Derived **EntityType** elements cannot define an entity **Key**. A key forms the identity of the **Entity**.
- An **EntityType** can have any number of **Property** and [NavigationProperty](#Section_2.1.4) elements in any given order.
- **EntityTypeProperty** child elements are uniquely named within the inheritance hierarchy for the **EntityType**. **Property** child elements and **NavigationProperty** child elements cannot have the same name as their declaring **EntityType**.
- An **EntityType** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) element blocks.
- In CSDL 1.2, CSDL 2.0, and CSDL 3.0, an **EntityType** that represents an **OpenEntityType** MUST have an **OpenType** attribute that is defined with its value equal to "true".
- In CSDL 1.2, CSDL 2.0, and CSDL 3.0, an **EntityType** that derives from an **OpenEntityType** is itself an **OpenEntityType**. Such a derived **EntityType** cannot have an **OpenType** attribute with its value equal to "false", but the derived **EntityType** can have an **OpenType** attribute defined with its value equal to "true".
- In CSDL 3.0, **EntityType** can contain any number of **TypeAnnotation** elements.
- In CSDL 3.0, **EntityType** can contain any number of **ValueAnnotation** elements.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the EntityType element.](media/image2.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated. For all child elements within a given choice, the child elements can be ordered arbitrarily.

<a id="Section_2.1.3"></a>
### 2.1.3 Property

The [**declared properties**](#gt_declared-property) of an [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2) element or [ComplexType](#Section_2.1.7) element are defined by using the **Property** element. **EntityType** and **ComplexType** can have **Property** elements. **Property** can be a scalar type or **ComplexType**. A declared property description consists of the declared property's name, type, and a set of [**facets**](#gt_facet), such as [Nullable](#Section_2.2.1.1.1) or [Default](#Section_2.2.1.1.3). Facets describe further behavior of a given type; they are optional to define.

The following is an example of a **Property** element.

<Property Name="ProductName" Type="String" Nullable="false" MaxLength="40">

The following rules apply to the **Property** element:

- The **Property** MUST define the **Name** attribute.
- The **Property** MUST have the **Type** defined.
- The **Property** type is either a scalar type or a **ComplexType** that is [**in scope**](#gt_in-scope) and that has a [**namespace qualified name**](#gt_namespace-qualified-name) or [**alias qualified name**](#gt_alias-qualified-name).
- In CSDL 3.0, a **Type** attribute in the **Property** element can have the value "Collection". "Collection" represents a set of non-nullable scalar type instances or **ComplexType** instances. It can be expressed as an attribute (example 1) or by using child element syntax, see [TypeRef (section 2.1.26)](#Section_2.1.26) (example 2). **TypeRef** is only allowed if the **Type** attribute value is equal to "Collection".
In example 1, **Property** uses a **Type** attribute.

<Property Name="AlternateAddresses" Type="Collection(Model.Address)" />

In example 2, **Property** uses child element syntax.

<Property Name="AlternateAddresses" Type="Collection">

<TypeRef Type="Model.Address" />

</Property>

- **Property** can define a **Nullable** facet. The default value is Nullable=true. In CSDL 1.0, CSDL 1.1, and CSDL 2.0, any **Property** that has a type of **ComplexType** also defines a **Nullable** attribute that is set to "false".
- The following facets are optional to define on **Property**:
- DefaultValue
- MaxLength
- FixedLength
- Precision
- Scale
- Unicode
- Collation
- SRID
- In CSDL 1.1, CSDL 1.2, CSDL 2.0, and CSDL 3.0, a **Property** element can define a **CollectionKind** attribute. The possible values are "None", "List", and "Bag".
- **Property** can define [ConcurrencyMode](#Section_2.2.4). The possible values are "None" and "Fixed". However, for an **EntityType** that has a corresponding **EntitySet** defined, any **EntityType** elements that are derived from the **EntitySet** MUST NOT define any new **Property** with **ConcurrencyMode** set to a value other than "None".
- **Property** can contain any number of [AnnotationAttribute](#Section_2.2.7) attributes. The full names of the **AnnotationAttribute** attributes cannot collide.
- A **Property** element can contain a maximum of one [Documentation](#Section_2.1.21) element.
- **Property** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) elements.
- In CSDL 3.0, **Property** can contain any number of [ValueAnnotation](#Section_3.1) elements.
- Child elements of **Property** are to appear in this sequence: **Documentation**, **AnnotationElement**.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the Property element.](media/image3.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

A dynamic property follows these rules:

- If an instance of an **OpenEntityType** does not include a value for a dynamic property named *N*, the instance is treated as if it includes *N* with a value of "null".
- A dynamic property of an **OpenEntityType** cannot have the same name as a declared property on the same **OpenEntityType**.
<a id="Section_2.1.4"></a>
### 2.1.4 NavigationProperty

**NavigationProperty** elements define non-structural properties on [**entities**](#gt_entity) that allow for navigation from one **Entity** to another via a relationship. Standard properties describe a value that is associated with an entity, while navigation properties describe a navigation path over a relationship. For example, given a relationship between Customer and Order entities, an Order [EntityType (section 2.1.2)](#Section_2.1.2) can describe a **NavigationProperty**"OrderedBy" that represents the Customer instance associated with that particular Order instance.

The following is an example of a **NavigationProperty** element.

<NavigationProperty Name="Orders" Relationship="Model1.CustomerOrder" FromRole="Customer" ToRole="Order" />

The following rules apply to the **NavigationProperty** element:

- **NavigationProperty** MUST have a **Name** defined.
- **NavigationProperty** MUST have a **Relationship** attribute defined.
- The **Relationship** attribute can be either a [**namespace qualified name**](#gt_namespace-qualified-name) or an [**alias qualified name**](#gt_alias-qualified-name) of an [Association (section 2.1.8)](#Section_2.1.8) element that is [**in scope**](#gt_in-scope).
- **NavigationProperty** MUST have a **ToRole** attribute defined. **ToRole** specifies the other end of the relationship and refers to one of the role names that is defined on the **Association**.
- **NavigationProperty** MUST have a **FromRole** defined. **FromRole** is used to establish the starting point for the navigation and refers to one of the role names that is defined on the **Association**.
- **NavigationProperty** can contain any number of **AnnotationAttribute** attributes. The full names of the **AnnotationAttribute** attributes cannot collide.
- **NavigationProperty** can contain a maximum of one [Documentation](#Section_2.1.21) element.
- **NavigationProperty** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) elements.
- In CSDL 3.0, **NavigationProperty** can have a **ContainsTarget** defined. When **ContainsTarget** is absent, it defaults to "false". When it is set to "true", **ContainsTarget** indicates [containment NavigationProperty (section 2.1.39)](#Section_2.1.39).
- In CSDL 3.0, **NavigationProperty** can contain any number of [ValueAnnotation](#Section_3.1) elements.
- Child elements of **NavigationProperty** are to appear in this sequence: **Documentation**, **AnnotationElement**.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the NavigationProperty element.](media/image4.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.5"></a>
### 2.1.5 Entity Key

A **Key** element describes which **Property** elements form a key that can uniquely identify instances of an **EntityType**. Any set of non-nullable, immutable, [**scalar type**](#gt_scalar-type) [**declared properties**](#gt_declared-property) can serve as the key.

The following is an example of the **Key** element.

<Key>

<PropertyRef Name="CustomerId" />

</Key>

The following rules apply to the **Key** element:

- **Key** can contain any number of **AnnotationAttribute** attributes. The full names of the **AnnotationAttribute** attributes cannot collide.
- **Key** MUST have one or more [PropertyRef](#Section_2.1.6) child elements.
- Each **PropertyRef** child element names a [Property](#Section_2.1.3) of a type that is equality comparable.
- In CSDL 2.0 and CSDL 3.0, **Key** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) elements.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the Key element of EntityType.](media/image5.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.6"></a>
### 2.1.6 PropertyRef

**PropertyRef** element refers to a [**declared property**](#gt_declared-property) of an [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2).

The following is an example of **PropertyRef**.

<PropertyRef Name="CustomerId" />

The following rules apply to the **PropertyRef** element:

- **PropertyRef** can contain any number of [AnnotationAttribute](#Section_2.2.7) attributes. The full names of the **AnnotationAttribute** attributes MUST NOT collide.
- **PropertyRef** MUST define the **Name** attribute. The **Name** attribute refers to the name of a **Property** defined in the declaring **EntityType**.
- In CSDL 2.0 and CSDL 3.0, **PropertyRef** can contain any number of **AnnotationElement** elements.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the PropertyRef element.](media/image6.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.7"></a>
### 2.1.7 ComplexType

A **ComplexType** element represents a set of related information. Like an [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2) element, a **ComplexType** element consists of one or more properties of scalar type or complex type. However, unlike an **EntityType** element, a **ComplexType** element cannot have an [entity Key](#Section_2.1.5) element or any [NavigationProperty](#Section_2.1.4) elements. **ComplexType** can be categorized as an [**EDM type**](#gt_edm-type).

A **ComplexType** element provides a mechanism to create [**declared properties**](#gt_declared-property) with a rich (structured) payload. Its definition includes its name and payload. The payload of a **ComplexType** is very similar to that of an **EntityType**.

The following is an example of the **ComplexType** element.

<ComplexType Name="CAddress">

<Documentation>

<Summary>This complextype describes the concept of an Address</Summary>

<LongDescription>This complextype describes the concept of an Address for use with Customer and other Entities</LongDescription>

</Documentation>

<Property Name="StreetAddress" Type="String">

<Documentation>

<LongDescription>StreetAddress contains the string describing the address of the street associated with an address</LongDescription>

</Documentation>

</Property>

<Property Name="City" Type="String" />

<Property Name="Region" Type="String" />

<Property Name="PostalCode" Type="String" />

</ComplexType>

The following rules apply to the **ComplexType** element:

- A **ComplexType** MUST have a **Name** attribute defined. **Name** is of type [SimpleIdentifier](#Section_2.2.6) and represents the name of this **ComplexType**.
- **ComplexType** is a [**schema level named element**](#gt_schema-level-named-element) and has a unique name.
- In CSDL 1.1, CSDL 1.2, CSDL 2.0, and CSDL 3.0, a **ComplexType** can derive from a **BaseType**. **BaseType** is either the [**namespace qualified name**](#gt_namespace-qualified-name) or [**alias qualified name**](#gt_alias-qualified-name) of another **ComplexType** that is [**in scope**](#gt_in-scope).
- A **ComplexType** cannot introduce an inheritance cycle via the **BaseType** attribute.
- In CSDL 1.1, CSDL 1.2, CSDL 2.0, and CSDL 3.0, **ComplexType** can have its **Abstract** attribute set to "true". By default, **Abstract** is set to "false".
- A **ComplexType** can contain any number of [AnnotationAttribute](#Section_2.2.7) attributes. The full names of the **AnnotationAttribute** attributes cannot collide.
- A **ComplexType** element can contain a maximum of one [Documentation](#Section_2.1.21) element.
- A **ComplexType** can have any number of [Property](#Section_2.1.3) elements.
- In CSDL 1.1, CSDL 1.2, CSDL 2.0, and CSDL 3.0, the property names of a **ComplexType** MUST be uniquely named within the inheritance hierarchy for the **ComplexType**. **ComplexType** properties MUST NOT have the same name as their declaring **ComplexType** or any of its base types.
- **ComplexType** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) elements.
- Child elements of **ComplexType** are to appear in this sequence: **Documentation**, **Property**, **AnnotationElement**.
- In CSDL 3.0, **ComplexType** can contain any number of [TypeAnnotation](#Section_2.1.32) elements.
- In CSDL 3.0, **ComplexType** can contain any number of [ValueAnnotation](#Section_3.1) elements.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the ComplexType element.](media/image7.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated. For all child elements within a given choice, the child elements can be ordered arbitrarily.

<a id="Section_2.1.8"></a>
### 2.1.8 Association

An **Association** element defines a peer-to-peer relationship between participating [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2) elements and can support different multiplicities at the two ends. [OnDelete](#Section_2.1.10) operational behavior can be specified at any end of the relationship. An association type can be categorized as an [**EDM type**](#gt_edm-type).

An example of an [**association**](#gt_association) is the relationship between the Customer and Order [**entities**](#gt_entity). Typically, this relationship has the following characteristics:

- Multiplicity: Each Order is associated with exactly one Customer. Every Customer has zero or more Orders.
- Operational behavior: **OnDelete** Cascade; when an Order with one or more OrderLines is deleted, the corresponding OrderLines also get deleted.
The following is an example of an **Association** element.

<Association Name="CustomerOrder">

<End Type="Model1.Customer" Role="Customer" Multiplicity="1" />

<End Type="Model1.Order" Role="Order" Multiplicity="*" />

</Association>

The following rules apply to the **Association** element:

- **Association** MUST have a **Name** attribute defined. The **Name** attribute is of type [SimpleIdentifier](#Section_2.2.6).
- An **Association** is a [**schema level named element**](#gt_schema-level-named-element) and has a unique name.
- **Association** can contain any number of [AnnotationAttribute](#Section_2.2.7) attributes. The full names of **AnnotationAttribute** cannot collide.
- An **Association** element can contain a maximum of one [Documentation](#Section_2.1.21) element.
- **Association** MUST have exactly two [End](#Section_f5fec50d29304265945d965cd4db8153) elements defined.
- **Association** can have one [ReferentialConstraint](#Section_2.1.11) element defined.
- **Association** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) elements.
- Child elements of **Association** are to appear in this sequence: **Documentation**, **End**, **ReferentialConstraint**, **AnnotationElement**.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the Association element.](media/image8.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.9"></a>
### 2.1.9 Association End

For a given **Association**, the **End** element defines one side of the relationship. **End** defines what type is participating in the relationship, multiplicity or the [**cardinality**](#gt_cardinality), and if there are any operation [**associations**](#gt_association), like cascade delete.

The following is an example of an **End** element.

<End Type="Model1.Customer" Role="Customer" Multiplicity="1" />

The following rules apply to the **Association End** element:

- **End** MUST define the **EntityType** for this end of the relationship.
- **EntityType** is either a [**namespace qualified name**](#gt_namespace-qualified-name) or an [**alias qualified name**](#gt_alias-qualified-name) of an **EntityType** that is [**in scope**](#gt_in-scope).
- **End** MUST specify the **Multiplicity** of this end.
- **End** can specify the **Role** name.
- **End** can contain any number of **AnnotationAttribute** attributes. The full names of the **AnnotationAttribute** attributes cannot collide.
- **End** can contain a maximum of one **Documentation** element.
- At most, one **OnDelete** operation can be defined on a given **End**.
- **End** can contain any number of **AnnotationElement** elements.
- Child elements of **End** are to appear in this sequence: **Documentation**, **OnDelete**, **AnnotationElement**.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the End element of a given Association.](media/image9.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.10"></a>
### 2.1.10 OnDelete

The **OnDelete** element is a trigger that is associated with a relationship. The action is performed on one end of the relationship when the state of the other side of the relationship changes.

The following is an example of the **OnDelete** element.

<Association Name="CProductCategory">

<End Type="Self.CProduct" Multiplicity="*" />

<End Type="Self.CCategory" Multiplicity="0..1">

<OnDelete Action="Cascade" />

</End>

</Association>

The following rules apply to the **OnDelete** element:

- **OnDelete** MUST specify the action.
- **OnDelete** can contain any number of [AnnotationAttribute](#Section_2.2.7) attributes. The full names of the **AnnotationAttribute** attributes cannot collide.
- The **OnDelete** element can contain a maximum of one [Documentation](#Section_2.1.21) element.
- **OnDelete** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) elements.
- Child elements of **OnDelete** are to appear in this sequence: **Documentation**, **AnnotationElement**.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the OnDelete element.](media/image10.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.11"></a>
### 2.1.11 ReferentialConstraint

In [**Entity Data Model (EDM)**](#gt_entity-data-model-edm), a **ReferentialConstraint** element can exist between the key of one [**entity**](#gt_entity) type and the primitive property or properties of an associated entity type. A referential constraint is a constraint on the keys contained in the [**association**](#gt_association) type. In CSDL 1.0, CSDL 1.1, and CSDL 1.2, the referential constraint can exist only between the key properties of associated entities.

The two entity types are in a [Principal](#Section_2.1.12.1)-to-[Dependent](#Section_2.1.12.2) relationship, which can also be thought of as a type of parent-child relationship. When entities are related by an [Association](#Section_2.1.8) that specifies a referential constraint between the keys of the two entities, the dependent (child) entity object cannot exist without a valid relationship to a principal (parent) entity object.

**ReferentialConstraint** MUST specify which end is the **PrincipalRole** and which end is the **DependentRole** for the referential constraint.

The following is an example of **ReferentialConstraint**.

<Association Name="FK_Employee_Employee_ManagerID">

<End Role="Employee" Type="Adventureworks.Store.Employee" Multiplicity="1" />

<End Role="Manager" Type="Adventureworks.Store.Manager" Multiplicity="0..1" />

<ReferentialConstraint>

<Principal Role="Employee">

<PropertyRef Name="EmployeeID" />

</Principal>

<Dependent Role="Manager">

<PropertyRef Name="ManagerID" />

</Dependent>

</ReferentialConstraint>

</Association>

The following rules apply to the **ReferentialConstraint** element:

- **ReferentialConstraint** MUST define exactly one **Principal** end role element and exactly one **Dependent** end role element.
- **ReferentialConstraint** can contain any number of [AnnotationAttribute](#Section_2.2.7) attributes. The full names of the **AnnotationAttribute** attributes cannot collide.
- A **ReferentialConstraint** element can contain a maximum of one [Documentation](#Section_2.1.21) element.
- **ReferentialConstraint** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) elements.
- Child elements of **ReferentialConstraint** are to appear in this sequence: **Documentation**, **Principal**, **Dependent**, **AnnotationElement**.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the ReferentialConstraint element.](media/image11.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.12"></a>
### 2.1.12 ReferentialConstraint Role

When defining [ReferentialConstraint](#Section_2.1.11) elements, **Role** MUST be used to indicate which end of the [**association**](#gt_association) is the [Principal](#Section_2.1.12.1) and which end of the relationship is the [Dependent](#Section_2.1.12.2). Thus, the **ReferentialConstraint** contains two **Role** definitions: the **Principal** and the **Dependent**.

**ReferentialConstraintRole** usage conforms to the ordering rules for the child elements of **ReferentialConstraint,** as defined in ReferentialConstraint (section 2.1.11).

The following example of the **ReferentialConstraintRole** defines **Principal** and **Dependent** elements.

<ReferentialConstraint>

<Principal Role="Employee">

<PropertyRef Name="EmployeeID" />

</Principal>

<Dependent Role="Manager">

<PropertyRef Name="ManagerID" />

</Dependent>

</ReferentialConstraint>

<a id="Section_2.1.12.1"></a>
#### 2.1.12.1 Principal

The following example shows the usage of the **PrincipalRole** element in defining a [ReferentialConstraint](#Section_2.1.11) element.

<Principal Role="Employee">

<PropertyRef Name="EmployeeID" />

</Principal>

The following rules apply to the **PrincipalRole** element:

- One **PrincipalRole** MUST be used to define the **Principal** end of the **ReferentialConstraint**.
- Each **PrincipalRole** specifies one and only one **Role** attribute that is of type [SimpleIdentifier](#Section_2.2.6).
- **Principal** has one or more [PropertyRef](#Section_2.1.6) elements. Each **PropertyRef** element specifies a name by using the **Name** attribute.
- For each **Principal**, a **PropertyRef** definition cannot specify a **Name** value that is specified for another **PropertyRef**.
- **PropertyRef** is used to specify the properties that participate in the **PrincipalRole** of the **ReferentialConstraint**.
- Each **PropertyRef** element on the **Principal** corresponds to a **PropertyRef** on the [Dependent](#Section_2.1.12.2). The **Principal** and the **Dependent** of the **ReferentialConstraint** contains the same number of **PropertyRef** elements. The **PropertyRef** elements on the **Dependent** are listed in the same order as the corresponding **PropertyRef** elements on the **Principal**.
- The **Principal** of a **ReferentialConstraint** MUST specify all properties that constitute the **Key** of the **EntityType** that forms the **Principal** of the **ReferentialConstraint**.
- The **Multiplicity** of the **PrincipalRole** is 1. For CSDL 2.0 and CSDL 3.0, the **Multiplicity** of the **PrincipalRole** can be 1 or 0.1.
- The data type of each property that is defined in the **PrincipalRole** MUST be the same as the data type of the corresponding property that is specified in the **DependentRole**.
- In CSDL 2.0 and CSDL 3.0, **Principal** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) elements.
- Child elements of **Principal** are to appear in this sequence: **PropertyRef**, **AnnotationElement**.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the PrincipalRole element of ReferentialConstraint.](media/image12.png)All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.12.2"></a>
#### 2.1.12.2 Dependent

The following example shows the usage of the **DependentRole** element in defining a [ReferentialConstraint](#Section_2.1.11).

<Dependent Role="Manager">

<PropertyRef Name="ManagerID" />

</Dependent>

The following rules apply to the **DependentRole** element:

- One **DependentRole** MUST be used to define the **Dependent** end of the **ReferentialConstraint**.
- Each **DependentRole** MUST specify one and only one **Role** attribute that is of type [SimpleIdentifier](#Section_2.2.6).
- **Dependent** has one or more [PropertyRef](#Section_2.1.6) elements that specify a name by using the **Name** attribute.
- For each **Dependent**, a **PropertyRef** definition cannot specify a **Name** value that is specified for another **PropertyRef**.
- **PropertyRef** is used to specify the properties that participate in the **DependentRole** of the **ReferentialConstraint**.
- Each **PropertyRef** element on the **Principal** corresponds to a **PropertyRef** on the **Dependent**. The **Principal** and the **Dependent** of the **ReferentialConstraint** contain the same number of **PropertyRef** elements. The **PropertyRef** elements on the **Dependent** are listed in the same order as the corresponding **PropertyRef** elements on the **Principal**.
- The data type of each property that is defined in the [Principal](#Section_2.1.12.1) **Role** MUST be the same as the data type of the corresponding property specified in the **DependentRole**.
- In CSDL 2.0 and CSDL 3.0, **Dependent** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) elements.
- Child elements of **Dependent** are to appear in this sequence: **PropertyRef**, **AnnotationElement**.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the Dependent element of ReferentialConstraint.](media/image12.png)All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.13"></a>
### 2.1.13 Using

**Using** imports the contents of the specified [**namespace**](#gt_namespace). A [**schema**](#gt_schema) can refer to contents of another schema or namespace by importing it by using the **Using** clause. The imported namespace can be associated with an [**alias**](#gt_alias) that is then used to refer to its types, or the types can be directly used by specifying its fully qualified name.

**Note** Semantically, **Using** is closer to a merge. Unfortunately, the name does not reflect this. If it was truly "using", structures in the schema being used would be unaffected. However, because a dependent schema can derive an **EntityType** from an **EntityType** that is declared in the original schema, this has the potential side-effect of changing what might be found in **EntitySet** elements declared in the schema being used.

The following is an example of the **Using** element.

<Using Namespace="Microsoft.Samples.Northwind.Types"

Alias="Types" />

The following rules apply to the **Using** element:

- **Using** MUST have a **Namespace** attribute defined that is of type [QualifiedName](#Section_2.2.5).
- **Using** MUST have an **Alias** attribute defined that is of type [SimpleIdentifier](#Section_2.2.6). The alias can be used as shorthand for referring to the **Namespace** linked to that alias via the **Using** element.
- **Using** can contain any number of [AnnotationAttribute](#Section_2.2.7) attributes. The full names of the **AnnotationAttribute** attributes cannot collide.
- **Using** can contain a maximum of one [Documentation](#Section_2.1.21) element.
- **Using** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) elements.
- If a **Documentation** element is defined, it comes before any **AnnotationElement** elements.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the Using element.](media/image13.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.14"></a>
### 2.1.14 EntityContainer

**EntityContainer** is conceptually similar to a database or data source. It groups [EntitySet](#Section_2.1.18), [AssociationSet](#Section_2.1.19), and [FunctionImport](#Section_2.1.15) child elements that represent a data source.

The following is an example of the **EntityContainer** element.

<EntityContainer Name="Model1Container" >

<EntitySet Name="CustomerSet" EntityType="Model1.Customer" />

<EntitySet Name="OrderSet" EntityType="Model1.Order" />

<AssociationSet Name="CustomerOrder" Association="Model1.CustomerOrder">

<End Role="Customer" EntitySet="CustomerSet" />

<End Role="Order" EntitySet="OrderSet" />

</AssociationSet>

</EntityContainer>

The following rules apply to the **EntityContainer** element:

- **EntityContainer** MUST have a **Name** attribute defined that is of type [SimpleIdentifier](#Section_2.2.6).
- **EntityContainer** can define an **Extends** attribute, which, if present, refers to another **EntityContainer** [**in scope**](#gt_in-scope) by name.
- **EntityContainer** elements that extend another **EntityContainer** inherit all of the extended **EntitySet**, **AssociationSet**, and **FunctionImport** child elements from that **EntityContainer**.
- **EntityContainer** can contain a maximum of one [Documentation](#Section_2.1.21) element.
- **EntityContainer** can contain any number of [AnnotationAttribute](#Section_2.2.7) attributes. The full names of the **AnnotationAttribute** attributes cannot collide.
- **EntityContainer** can contain any number of **FunctionImport**, **EntitySet**, and **AssociationSet** elements, which can be defined in any order.
- **FunctionImport**, **EntitySet**, and **AssociationSet** names within an **EntityContainer** cannot collide.
- If present, the **Documentation** child element MUST precede **FunctionImport**, **EntitySet**, and **AssociationSet** child elements.
- In CSDL 2.0 and CSDL 3.0, **EntityContainer** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) elements.
- In CSDL 3.0, **EntityContainer** can contain any number of **ValueAnnotation** elements.
- In the sequence of child elements under **EntityContainer**, **AnnotationElement** follows all other elements.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the EntityContainer element.](media/image14.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated. For all child elements within a given choice, the child elements can be ordered arbitrarily.

<a id="Section_2.1.15"></a>
### 2.1.15 FunctionImport

**FunctionImport** element is used to import stored procedures or functions that are defined in the Store Schema Model into [**Entity Data Model (EDM)**](#gt_entity-data-model-edm).

The following is an example of the **FunctionImport** element.

<FunctionImport Name="annualCustomerSales" EntitySet="result_annualCustomerSalesSet" ReturnType="Collection(Self.result_annualCustomerSales)">

<Parameter Name="fiscalyear" Mode="In" Type="String" />

</FunctionImport>

The following rules apply to the **FunctionImport** element:

- **FunctionImport** MUST have a **Name** attribute defined. **Name** attribute is of type [SimpleIdentifier](#Section_2.2.6).
- **FunctionImport** can define a **ReturnType** as an attribute.
- In CSDL 3.0, the **ReturnType** can be defined as either an attribute or a child element, but not both.
- If defined in CSDL 1.1, CSDL 2.0, and CSDL 3.0, the type of **ReturnType** MUST be a [**scalar type**](#gt_scalar-type), [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2), or [ComplexType](#Section_2.1.7) that is [**in scope**](#gt_in-scope) or a [**collection**](#gt_collection) of one of these in-scope types. In CSDL 1.0, the **ReturnType** is collection of either scalar type or **EntityType**.
- Types that are in scope for a **FunctionImport** include all scalar types, **EntityTypes**, and **ComplexTypes** that are defined in the declaring **SchemaNamespace** or in [**schemas**](#gt_schema) that are in scope of the declaring **Schema**.
- If the return type of **FunctionImport** is a collection of [**entities**](#gt_entity), the **EntitySet** attribute is defined.
- If the return type of **FunctionImport** is of **ComplexType** or scalar type, the [EntitySet](#Section_2.1.18) attribute cannot be defined.
- **FunctionImport** can contain any number of [AnnotationAttribute](#Section_2.2.7) attributes. The full names of the **AnnotationAttribute** attributes cannot collide.
- The **FunctionImport** element can contain a maximum of one [Documentation](#Section_2.1.21) element.
- **FunctionImport** can have zero or more [Parameter](#Section_2.1.17) elements.
- **Parameter** element names inside a **FunctionImport** cannot collide.
- **FunctionImport** can have an **IsSideEffecting** attribute defined. Possible values are "true" and "false". If the **IsSideEffecting** attribute is omitted, the value of the **IsSideEffecting** attribute defaults to "true".
- **FunctionImport** can have an **IsBindable** attribute defined. Possible values are "true" and "false". If the **IsBindable** attribute is omitted, the value of the **IsBindable** attribute is assumed to be "false".
- When **IsBindable** is set to "true", **FunctionImport** MUST have at least one **Parameter** element defined.
- **FunctionImport** can have an **IsComposable** attribute defined. Possible values are "true" and "false". If the **IsComposable** attribute is omitted, the value of the **IsComposable** attribute is assumed to be "false".
- **FunctionImport** cannot have **IsComposable** set to "true" if **IsSideEffecting** is set to "true".
- In CSDL 2.0 and CSDL 3.0, **FunctionImport** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) elements.
- In CSDL 3.0, **FunctionImport** can have an **EntitySetPath** attribute defined. **EntitySetPath** defines the **EntitySet** that contains the entities that are returned by the **FunctionImport** when that **EntitySet** is dependent on one of the **FunctionImport** parameters. For example, the entities returned from a **FunctionImport** can be dependent on the entity set that is passed to the **FunctionImport** as a parameter. In this case, a static **EntitySet** is not sufficient, and an **EntitySetPath** is used. **EntitySetPath** is composed of segments that are separated by a forward slash. The first segment refers to a **FunctionImport** parameter. Each remaining segment represents either navigation, in which case the segment is a **SimpleIdentifier**, or a type cast, in which case the segment is a **QualifiedName**.
- In CSDL 3.0, **FunctionImport** can contain any number of [ValueAnnotation](#Section_3.1) elements.
- Child elements of **FunctionImport** are to appear in this sequence: **Documentation** (if present), **ReturnType**, **Parameter**, **AnnotationElement**.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the FunctionImport element.](media/image15.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.16"></a>
### 2.1.16 FunctionImport ReturnType

A **ReturnType** describes the shape of data that is returned from a [FunctionImport](#Section_2.1.15) element. **ReturnType** is used to map to stored procedures with multiple result sets. In CSDL 3.0, the return type of a function import can be declared as a child element.

The following is an example of the **ReturnType** element.

<FunctionImport Name="GetOrdersAndProducts"> <ReturnType Type="Collection(Self.Order)" EntitySet="Orders"/> <ReturnType Type="Collection(Self.Product)" EntitySet="Products"/></FunctionImport>

The following rules apply to the **FunctionImport ReturnType** element:

- **ReturnType** can define type declarations as an attribute.
- If defined in CSDL 1.1, CSDL 2.0, or CSDL 3.0, the **Type** of **FunctionImport ReturnType** MUST be an [EDMSimpleType](#Section_2.2.1), [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2), or [ComplexType](#Section_2.1.7) that is [**in scope**](#gt_in-scope) or a [**collection**](#gt_collection) of one of these in-scope types. In CSDL 1.0, the **ReturnType** is a collection of either **EDMSimpleType** or **EntityType**.
- **ReturnType** can contain any number of [AnnotationAttribute](#Section_2.2.7) attributes. The full names of the **AnnotationAttribute** attributes cannot collide.
- The order of the **ReturnType** elements MUST match that of the underlying stored procedure.

</FunctionImport>

The following rules apply to the **FunctionImport Parameter** element:

- **Parameter** MUST have a **Name** defined.
- The **Type** of the **Parameter** MUST be defined. **Type** is a [**scalar type**](#gt_scalar-type), [ComplexType](#Section_2.1.7), or [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2) or a [**collection**](#gt_collection) of scalar, **ComplexType**, or **EntityType** types.
- **Parameter** can define the **Mode** of the parameter. Possible values are "In", "Out", and "InOut".
- For a given **Parameter**, a [MaxLength](#Section_2.2.1.2.1.1) value can be specified.

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.19"></a>
### 2.1.19 AssociationSet

An **AssociationSet** contains relationship instances of the specified [**association**](#gt_association). The association specifies the [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2) elements of the two end points, whereas **AssociationSet** specifies the [EntitySet](#Section_2.1.18) element that corresponds to either these **EntityType** elements directly or to derived **EntityType** elements. The association instances that are contained in the **AssociationSet** relate [**entity**](#gt_entity) instances that belong to these **EntityType** elements.

The following is an example of the **AssociationSet**.

<AssociationSet Name="CustomerOrder" Association="Model1.CustomerOrder">

<End Role="Customer" EntitySet="CustomerSet" />

<End Role="Order" EntitySet="OrderSet" />

</AssociationSet>

The following rules apply to the **AssociationSet** element:

- **AssociationSet** MUST have a **Name** attribute defined that is of type [SimpleIdentifier](#Section_2.2.6).
- **AssociationSet** MUST have an **Association** attribute defined. The **Association** attribute specifies the [**namespace qualified name**](#gt_namespace-qualified-name) or [**alias qualified name**](#gt_alias-qualified-name) of the **Association** for which the **AssociationSet** is being defined.
- The **Association** of an **AssociationSet** MUST be [**in scope**](#gt_in-scope) of the [Schema](#Section_2.1.1) that declares the [EntityContainer](#Section_2.1.14) in which this **AssociationSet** resides.

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.20"></a>
### 2.1.20 AssociationSet End

The **End** element defines the two sides of the [AssociationSet](#Section_2.1.19) element. This [**association**](#gt_association) is defined between the two **EntitySets** declared in an [EntitySet](#Section_2.1.18) attribute.

The following is an example of the **End** element.

<End Role="Customer" EntitySet="CustomerSet" />

The following rules apply to **End** elements inside an **AssociationSet**:

- **End** element can have the **Role** attribute specified. All **End** elements have the **EntitySet** attribute specified.
- The **EntitySet** is the **Name** of an **EntitySet** defined inside the same **EntityContainer**.
- The **Role** of the **End** element MUST map to a **Role** declared on one of the **Ends** of the **Assocation** referenced by the **End** element's declaring AssociationSet.
- Each **End** that is declared by an **AssociationSet** refers to a different **Role**.
- The [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2) for a particular **AssociationSetEnd** is the same as or derived from the **EntityType** that is contained by the related **EntitySet**. An **End** element can contain a maximum of one [Documentation](#Section_2.1.21) element.
- **End** can contain any number of [AnnotationElement](#Section_2.1.22) elements.
- The child elements of **End** are to appear in this sequence: **Documentation**, **AnnotationElement**.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the End element of a given AssociationSet element.](media/image20.png)

All child elements are to appear in the order indicated.

<a id="Section_2.1.21"></a>
### 2.1.21 Documentation

The **Documentation** element is used to provide documentation of comments on the contents of the [**conceptual schema definition language (CSDL)**](#gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl) file.

The following is an example of the **Documentation** element on the [EntityContainer](#Section_2.1.14) element.

<EntityContainer Name="TwoThreeContainer">

<Documentation>

<Summary>Summary: Entity Container for storing Northwind instances</Summary>

<LongDescription>LongDescription: This Entity Container is for storing Northwind instances</LongDescription>

</Documentation>

<EntitySet Name="Products" EntityType="Self.Product" />

### 2.1.22 AnnotationElement

An **AnnotationElement** is a custom XML element that is applied to a [**conceptual schema definition language (CSDL)**](#gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl) element. The **AnnotationElement** element and its child elements can belong to any [**XML namespace**](#gt_xml-namespace) that is not in the list of reserved XML namespaces for CSDL. Consult the section for each CSDL element within this document to determine whether an **AnnotationElement** can be used for that element.

The following is an example of the **AnnotationElement** element.

<EntityType Name="Content">

<Key>

<PropertyRef Name="ID" />

</Key>

<Property Name="ID" Type="Guid" Nullable="false" />

<Property Name="HTML" Type="String" Nullable="false" MaxLength="Max" Unicode="true"

FixedLength="false" />

<CLR:Attributes>

<CLR:Attribute TypeName="System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContract"/>

<CLR:Attribute TypeName="MyNamespace.MyAttribute"/>

</CLR:Attributes>

<RS:Security>

<RS:ACE Principal="S-0-123-1321" Rights="+R+W"/>

<a id="Section_2.1.37"></a>
### 2.1.37 EnumType

An **EnumType** element is used in CSDL 3.0 to declare an [**enumeration type**](#gt_enumeration-type). Enumeration types are [**scalar types**](#gt_scalar-type).

An enumeration type has a **Name** attribute, an optional **UnderlyingType** attribute, an optional **IsFlags** attribute, and a payload that consists of zero or more declared **Member** elements.

The following is an example of the **EnumType** element.

<EnumType Name="ContentType" UnderlyingType="Edm.Int32" IsFlags="true">

<Member Name="Liquid" Value="1"/>

<Member Name="Perishable" Value="2"/>

<Member Name="Edible" Value="4"/>

</EnumType>

Enumeration types are equal-comparable, order-comparable, and can participate in [**entity**](#gt_entity) [Key](#Section_2.1.5) elements—that is, they can be the **Key** or can be a part of the **Key**. An enumeration can be categorized as an [**EDM type**](#gt_edm-type).

The following rules apply to the **EnumType** element:

- **EnumType** elements MUST specify a **Name** attribute that is of type [SimpleIdentifier](#Section_2.2.6).
- **EnumType** is a [**schema level named element**](#gt_schema-level-named-element) and has a unique name.
- **EnumType** elements can specify an **UnderlyingType** attribute which is an integral [EDMSimpleType](#Section_2.2.1), such as [SByte](#Section_2.2.1.11), [Int16](#Section_2.2.1.12), [Int32](#Section_2.2.1.13), [Int64](#Section_2.2.1.14), or [Byte](#Section_2.2.1.15). **Edm.Int32** is assumed if it is not specified in the declaration.
- **EnumType** elements can specify an **IsFlags** Boolean attribute, which are assumed to be false if it is not specified in the declaration. If the enumeration type can be treated as a bit field, **IsFlags** is set to "true".
- **EnumType** elements can contain a list of zero or more **Member** child elements that are referred to as declared enumeration members.

<a id="Section_2.1.38"></a>
### 2.1.38 EnumType Member

A **Member** element is used inside an [EnumType](#Section_2.1.37) element to declare a member of an enumeration type.

The following rules apply to declared enumeration type members:

- **Member** elements MUST specify a **Name** attribute that is unique within the **EnumType** declaration.
- **Member** elements can specify the **Value** attribute that is a valid **Edm.Long**.
- The order of the **Member** elements has meaning and MUST be preserved.
- If the value of the **Member** element is not specified, the value is zero for the first member and one more than the value of the previous member for subsequent members.
- Multiple members with different **Name** attributes can have the same **Value** attributes. When mapping from a value of the underlying type to a **Member** of an **EnumType**, the first matching **Member** is used.
![Graphic representation in table format of the rules that apply to the Member element.](media/image31.png)

<a id="Section_2.1.39"></a>
### 2.1.39 Containment NavigationProperty

Containment is specified by using a containment [NavigationProperty](#Section_2.1.4) element. A containment **NavigationProperty** is a **NavigationProperty** that has a **ContainsTarget** attribute set to "true".

The [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2) that declares the **NavigationProperty** is the container **EntityType**.

The AssociationType that is specified in the containment **NavigationProperty** is the containment **AssociationType**.

The **EntityType** that is specified on the **End** element of the containment **AssociationType**, with the **Name** that is specified by the containment **NavigationProperty** element's **ToRole** attribute, is the contained **EntityType**.

When the instances of both the contained [**entity**](#gt_entity) and the container entity reside in the same [EntitySet](#Section_2.1.18), it is called recursive containment.

It MUST NOT be possible for an **EntityType** to contain itself by following more than one containment **NavigationProperty**.

The contained **EntityType** can have a **NavigationProperty** that navigates to the container **EntityType** via the containment **AssociationType**.

The **End** of the containment **AssociationType** that is specified by the **ToRole** attribute of the containment **NavigationProperty** can have any multiplicity.

For nonrecursive containment, the **End** of the containment **AssociationType** that is specified by the **FromRole** attribute of the containment **NavigationProperty** MUST have a multiplicity of '1'.

For recursive containment, the **End** of the containment **AssociationType** that is specified by the **FromRole** attribute of the containment **NavigationProperty** MUST have a multiplicity of '0..1'. The **End** that is specified by the **ToRole** cannot have a multiplicity of '1' because this would lead to endless recursion.

An [AssociationSet](#Section_2.1.19) has to have the same **EntitySet** on both ends if it is for a containment **AssociationType** that has either the same **EntityType** on both ends or an **EntityType** on one end that derives from the **EntityType** on the other end.

An **EntitySet** cannot be bound by **AssociationSet** to more than one **AssociationType** via a containment **NavigationProperty** that indicates that the **EntityType** (or derived **EntityTypes**) of that **EntitySet** is contained.

**Note** Because the **EntityType** of an **EntitySet** on an [AssociationSet End](#Section_2.1.20) has to be the same as or derived from the **EntityTypes** on the corresponding **AssociationType End**, the **EntitySet** MUST be either completely contained or completely noncontained.

<a id="Section_2.2.1.26"></a>
#### 2.2.1.26 Geometry

The **Geometry** type represents any geospatial data type that uses a geometric (flat-earth) coordinate system. Each entity’s data can be of any of the geometric primitive types; **Geometry** acts as an abstract base class for those types. The subclasses of **Geometry** are **GeometryPoint**, **GeometryLineString**, **GeometryPolygon**, **GeometryCollection**, **GeometryMultiPoint**, **GeometryMultiLineString**, and **GeometryMultiPolygon**. **Geometry** is not equality comparable, so it cannot be used in keys.

**Geometry** is not an instantiable type. An entity can declare a property to be of type **Geometry**. An instance of an entity MUST NOT have a value of type **Geometry**. Each value MUST be of some subtype.

<a id="Section_2.2.1.26.1"></a>
##### 2.2.1.26.1 Facets

The EDM simple type facets applicable for this type are **SRID**. **SRID** is optional.

<a id="Section_2.2.1.26.1.1"></a>
###### 2.2.1.26.1.1 SRID

The **SRID** facet is an Int value. This value corresponds to the System Reference Identifier for the coordinate system that is used. The valid values and their meanings are as defined by the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) [[EPSG]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=148018). If SRID is not specified, the default value of 0 is assumed, which corresponds to a unitless planar coordinate system without a defined origin.

<a id="Section_2.2.2"></a>
### 2.2.2 Action

**Action** can either be "Cascade" or "None".

The cascade action implies that the operation to delete an [**entity**](#gt_entity) deletes the relationship instance and then applies the action on the entity-instance at the other end of the relationship. For example, when a Customer is deleted, the cascade action specifies to delete all Orders that belong to that Customer.

<a id="Section_2.2.3"></a>
### 2.2.3 Multiplicity

The **Multiplicity** of a relationship describes the [**cardinality**](#gt_cardinality) or number of instances of an [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2) that can be associated with the instances of another **EntityType**.

The possible types of multiplicity are as follows: one-to-one, one-to-many, zero-one to one, zero-one to many, and many-to-many.

<a id="Section_2.2.4"></a>
### 2.2.4 ConcurrencyMode

**ConcurrencyMode** is a special facet that can be applied to any primitive [**Entity Data Model (EDM)**](#gt_entity-data-model-edm) type. Possible values are "None", which is the default, and "Fixed".

When used on an [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2) property, **ConcurrencyMode** specifies that the value of that [**declared property**](#gt_declared-property) is used for optimistic concurrency checks. Essentially, declared properties marked with a fixed **ConcurrencyMode** become part of a **ConcurrencyToken**.

The following rules apply to **ConcurrencyMode**:

- The property's type MUST be a simple type. It cannot be applied to properties of a [ComplexType](#Section_2.1.7).
- The property MUST be a declared property.
<a id="Section_2.2.5"></a>
### 2.2.5 QualifiedName

**QualifiedName** is a string-based representation of the name of the element or attribute.

The following pattern represents the allowed [**identifiers**](#gt_identifier) for **QualifiedName**.

Value="[\p{L}\p{Nl}][\p{L}\p{Nl}\p{Nd}\p{Mn}\p{Mc}\p{Pc}\p{Cf}]{0,}(\.[\p{L}\p{Nl}][\p{L}\p{Nl}\p{Nd}\p{Mn}\p{Mc}\p{Pc}\p{Cf}]{0,}){0,}"

<a id="Section_2.2.6"></a>
### 2.2.6 SimpleIdentifier

**SimpleIdentifier** is a string-based representation. The maximum length of the [**identifier**](#gt_identifier) MUST be less than 480.

The following pattern represents the allowed identifiers in the ECMA specification as specified in [[ECMA-334]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=93452) sections 9.4.2 and A.1.6.

value="[\p{L}\p{Nl}][\p{L}\p{Nl}\p{Nd}\p{Mn}\p{Mc}\p{Pc}\p{Cf}]{0,}"

<a id="Section_2.2.7"></a>
### 2.2.7 AnnotationAttribute

An **AnnotationAttribute** is a custom XML attribute that is applied to a [**CSDL**](#gt_conceptual-schema-definition-language-csdl) element. The attribute can belong to any [**XML namespace**](#gt_xml-namespace) (as defined in [[XMLNS-2ED]](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90602)) that is not in the list of reserved XML namespaces for CSDL. Consult the reference for each CSDL element within this document to determine whether **AnnotationAttribute** can be used for that element.

<a id="Section_2.2.8"></a>
### 2.2.8 OpenType

**OpenType** is a facet that can be applied to any [EntityType](#Section_2.1.2). Possible values are "false", which is the default, and "true".

**EntityType** elements marked with OpenType="false" or **EntityType** elements that do not explicitly include an **OpenType** attribute indicate that the element defines an **EntityType**. **EntityType** elements marked with OpenType="true" indicate that the element defines an **OpenEntityType**.

<a id="Section_2.2.9"></a>
### 2.2.9 TypeTerm

**TypeTerm** is a base type that is used to define [**vocabulary**](#gt_vocabulary) terms.

<a id="Section_2.3"></a>
## 2.3 Facet Application

Facets apply to the nominal type referenced in the element where the facet is declared. In the following example, the **Nullable** facet applies to the **DateTime** referenced type.

<Property Name="SuggestedTimes" Type="Collection(DateTime)" Nullable="true" />

In the following example, the **Nullable** facet can only be placed on the child element that references the **DateTime** type. Facets cannot be applied to **Collection** type references.

<ReturnType>

<CollectionType TypeRef="DateTime" Nullable="true" />

</ReturnType>
